I don't think we have time to experience job losses, disinformation, massive security fraud, fake idenitity and much of the fear that most people have simply because that the world would have no time to catch up.

Things are moving way too fast for any tech to monitize it. Let's do a thought experiment on what the current AI systems could do. It would probably replace or at least change a lot of professions like teachers, tutors, designers, engineers, doctors, laywers and a bunch more you name it. However, we don't have time for that.

The world is changing way too slowly for taking advantage of any of the breakthough. I think there is a real chance that we run straight to AGI and beyond. 

By this rate, a robot which is capable of doing the most basic human jobs could be done within maybe 3 years to be conservative and that is considering what we currently have, not the next month, the next 6 months or even the next year.

vit4d0,,I lost hope on the Singularity a few years ago. Stumbled on Dall-E 2 a few days ago and suddenly I'm excited again.,"I remember reading Kurzweil's ""Singularity is Near"" book when I was in the 6th grade. Fast forward 7 years later, I was in college watching a Kickstarter video for Oculus VR (circa 2012). 10 years has passed since that kickstarter video. 17 years since I read Kurzweil's book. The past months I've been reflecting, and by and large, the future had not lived up to it's hype. Not much has changed. I haven't touched my Quest 2 headset in over a year. The tech is just not there yet. But the other day I stumbled on Dall-E 2 and all I could say was wtf! How is this possible? And why is it not making any news??

So what is the deal with this thing? Growing up, people have always known me to hate art. Art always felt useless to me. But I have been completely obsessed the past few days, unable to stop looking at new images this system is capable of creating.

To me this completely blows GPT-3 out of the water. It is more impressive to me than Self driving cars, MuZero, LaMDA, etc. I don't want to see a GPT-4, but I definitely want to see a Dalle-3. To me, I can tell GPT is just a huge calculator that is a dead end in terms of progress to a general intelligence system. Dall-E on the other hand, seems to suggest generalized intelligence and creativity. 


So what is the catch? Why is this not being applauded as a huge milestone in AI development? I heard Google developed a similar system called Imagen but they never have plans to release it to the public? Wtf is going on? Why would a company not try to commercialize a product as easily as marketable as an image generating system? As a layman my best guess is either the software has certain limitations that would be quickly exposed if millions had access to it, or these companies never have plans to release anything that approximates a general artificial intelligence to the public; in that case we would be heading toward a dystopian future in which only a select few has access to all the good tech. We know how deeply selfish humans can be. If any company developed a general artificial intelligence system, they would probably hide it from the public for as long as possible. 

Any thoughts? And for people who have a greater understanding how Dalle works, I want to know what future versions of this thing will be capable of. Is this thing a gimmick despite how impressive seeming the images it's generating are? Will it be able to generate high quality videos with logical story lines? Music? Is it a sign that we are progressing toward general artificial intelligence or is it a path that leads to nowhere such as chatbots like gpt? This thing to me is the clearest sign I've seen that we are approaching a form of artificial general intelligence.",singularity,39,57,2022-06-23 09:45:30,ace111L

Abstract:

>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in the domain of text-to-image generation. However, the majority of these models still employ CLIP as their text encoder, which constrains their ability to comprehend dense prompts, which encompass multiple objects, detailed attributes, complex relationships, long-text alignment, etc. In this paper, We introduce an Efficient Large Language Model Adapter, termed ELLA, which **equips text-to-image diffusion models with powerful Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance text alignment without training of either U-Net or LLM**. To seamlessly bridge two pre-trained models, we investigate a range of semantic alignment connector designs and propose a novel module, the **Timestep-Aware Semantic Connector (TSC), which dynamically extracts timestep-dependent conditions from LLM**. Our approach adapts semantic features at different stages of the denoising process, assisting diffusion models in interpreting lengthy and intricate prompts over sampling timesteps. Additionally, ELLA can be readily incorporated with community models and tools to improve their prompt-following capabilities. To assess text-to-image models in dense prompt following, we introduce Dense Prompt Graph Benchmark (DPG-Bench), a challenging benchmark consisting of 1K dense prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of **ELLA in dense prompt following compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multiple object compositions involving diverse attributes and relationships**.

Github: [https://github.com/YangLing0818/RPG-DiffusionMaster](https://github.com/YangLing0818/RPG-DiffusionMaster) 

Abstract:

>Diffusion models have exhibit exceptional performance in text-to-image generation and editing. However, existing methods often face challenges when handling complex text prompts that involve multiple objects with multiple attributes and relationships. In this paper, we propose a **brand new training-free text-to-image generation/editing framework, namely Recaption, Plan and Generate (RPG), harnessing the powerful chain-of-thought reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image diffusion models.** Our approach employs the MLLM as a global planner to decompose the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler generation tasks within subregions. We propose complementary regional diffusion to enable region-wise compositional generation. Furthermore, we integrate text-guided image generation and editing within the proposed RPG in a closed-loop fashion, thereby enhancing generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our **RPG outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models, including DALL-E 3 and SDXL, particularly in multi-category object composition and text-image semantic alignment.** Notably, our RPG framework exhibits wide compatibility with various MLLM architectures (e.g., MiniGPT-4) and diffusion backbones (e.g., ControlNet).

1czmh0r,,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","I've been grappling with a significant dilemma regarding AI and its rapid advancements. It feels like we're on the brink of a singularity or some major upheaval in our economy, job market, and our very definitions of creativity and work. Yet, this doesn't seem obvious to everyone. Am I paranoid, or are others just not seeing it?

# The Skeptics

Many people I know, even those with technical backgrounds, see AI advancements as incremental rather than revolutionary. They argue that while current AI technologies, like large language models, can produce impressive results, they are often unreliable, prone to hallucinations, and make silly mistakes. They see things like co-pilot features as minor improvements rather than transformative technologies.

They also argue that humans will never want to see art or movies made by a computer because it lacks the human touch. In their mind, any significant improvement in AI capabilities would require a major boost in performance, something they don't see happening anytime soon.

# My Perspective

From my perspective, the progress in AI has been staggering. Back in 2014, we were saying that there was no way computers would win at Go anytime soon. Yet by 2016, AlphaGo had not only learned to play Go better than a very good Go player but also defeated the world champion. This was a stage we never thought we'd reach so quickly. Or at all.

Then came GPT-2 in 2019, which could generate coherent sentences—something that was previously unimaginable. A year later, GPT-3 arrived, and it was even more exciting and scary. This machine could emulate so many different scenarios, answer almost any question, and even role-play as a Linux system, allowing you to run commands like ping. It could do so many different things, something we couldn't have conceived of just a few years earlier.

Then we had ChatGPT-4, which was much better at logic. Suddenly, there was an explosion of AI models creating images, sound, and even movies. These advancements came more and more quickly, initially on a monthly basis, and now it's almost weekly. It’s crazy to think how fast this is all happening.

And all that is before the heavier future advancements in which multi-agents, combinations of current techniques, applying them to existing products (and future products).

To put in into images, here is a timeline I made from the advances I heard and cared about, certainly not all of them:

[Does this image not scream \\""exponential\\"" improvement? 😱](https://preview.redd.it/4oon7fd5xd2d1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f9934758a4ecf63420e23fc4e1e2255aee1523)



# Not as Bottlenecked as I Thought

I initially thought that AI would always require powerful servers, resulting in latency issues. But now we it seems that we are going to have local NPU chips that provide real-time AI processing on local devices. These chips enable AI applications to run faster and more efficiently, making the server dependency a non-issue. Local models, though smaller, are already outperforming larger, server-dependent counterparts.

I also thought that large language models (LLMs) would be limited to a single company, but we've seen an explosion of companies developing AI models. Not only that, but we also have free and unrestricted models available. The AI genie is so out of the bottle.

# Moving Goalposts

There's a sense, from the skeptics, that their goalposts keep shifting. We talked just 10 years ago about the Turing test and how hard it was for a computer to pass it. Now, it feels like the Turing test is far behind us, and yet people are saying things like, ""It's not really AI yet.""

If they keep redefining what is ""real"" AI, of course we'll never get there. Nor will we take seriously the risks and implications for humanity.

# The Future of AI

We’re witnessing a technological revolution, I feel it is about the level of industrial revolution or electricity revolution, at least. AI is no longer confined to text generation. We’re seeing advances in robotics, with AI driving unprecedented improvements. This is just the beginning. Quantum computing could further accelerate AI development, potentially leading to super AI within the next decade.

# Conclusion

The rapid pace of AI development is undeniable. While some see only incremental improvements, I see a transformative force reshaping our world. The skepticism surrounding AI's potential often feels like a refusal to acknowledge its impact. As we continue to expand and refine these technologies, we're venturing into uncharted territory, creating possibilities that were once the realm of science fiction.

xr9tkf,,My thoughts on DALL·E 2.,"I finally had a chance to try out DALL·E 2 after using Stable Diffusion for free for awhile now. DALL·E 2 does have better coherence and slightly better results, but not enough to justify the cost.

Hands and eyes are often misplaced, misshapen, or grotesque. I think we're a generation or two away from hands and eyes being resolved. I know that Google has upgraded their systems (more parameters and more tokens) to fix this issue but due to the pending legal battles for these AI art models they've never released those models to the public. 

In order to get an acceptable result it sometimes requires a few generations / variations which makes OpenAI's pricing model hard to stomach. 

I am being very picky as an AI model being able to convert text to images is mind blowing -- but it doesn't take long for expectations to adjust based on the state of the art. The good news is that future upgrades of DALL·E and stable diffusion will no doubt address the coherency issues and the understanding of human anatomy.

These systems are akin to a commodore 64 which was amazing at the time -- colors, sounds, etc. However, it had major memory and CPU limitations. These models show the promise of AI models but I don't think they're anything close to what we'll see in only a few years time which is when I think artists and programmers will finally see the writing on the wall, but by then a compensation scheme will probably have been ironed out in the courts since these AI models do use copyrighted pictures and code without the permission of the artists / programmers.

One final thought, OpenAI really missed the boat keeping this so close to the vest for so long which allowed competitors in the free market time to launch their own systems and eat their lunch. I am starting to wonder if OpenAI will be the next Friendster, Myspace, Lycos, or AltaVista. All of those companies were in a market early but made blunders that prevented them from becoming Facebook or Google.

uacjhc,,What Are Your Predictions for the Capabilities of Dall-E 3?,"Credit to u/Yuli-Ban for coming up with this thread question on other subreddits before I did. 

OpenAI announced Dall-E in January 2021, and considering Google revealed that AlphaFold made tremendous progress towards solving the protein folding problem a couple of months prior, the AI breakthroughs that so many futurists said would happen finally happened (to some extent). AI that creates original images from text felt like a huge leap forward, but because information technology advances so quickly, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before this iteration of Dall-E looked archaic compared to its successor.

Dall-E 2, announced this month, is a complete game changer, even more so than the original version. This new AI actually seems to exhibit some level of abstraction. It's good with lighting, reflections, creative interpretations, and while it's lackluster at best when it comes to text, that doesn't bother me, due to the fact that, like I said before - ""information technology advances so quickly"" - and it's because of that exponential nature of information technology that we can expect huge progress within a couple of years when OpenAI releases their next game-changing AI.

Whether in 2023 or 2024, Dall-E 3 is most definitely going to happen, and it wouldn't be surprising if the leap in progress from Dall-E 2 to Dall-E 3 is orders of magnitude more advanced than the leap in progress from Dall-E to Dall-E 2 was.

My predictions are that Dall-E 3 will be better at abstraction and include text-to-video, which when implemented, will completely change every entertainment industry. There will no longer be multi-million dollar movies, because everything that happens in any move, whether live action or animation, will be able to be replicated instantly for free by an advanced text-to-video generation system.

Now will the next Dall-E have highly advanced text-to-video capabilities? Probably not on the level of doing what I just said, but at some point in the near future, perhaps even in the 2020's (and most certainly in the 2030's), people are going to edit existing shows and movies, as well as create their own entirely original shows and movies, with AI capable of video synthesis. Of course, that's not all, because progress is only going to continue in all areas of AI, meaning that all art, shows, movies, music, games, novels, ect. are going to be AI-generated sooner rather than later, so the entertainment industries are going to become obsolete, and that's just fine, because those industries are awful anyway. The good news is that there will be endless amounts of new high quality original entertainment that will be fundamentally better than everything created before.",singularity,34,19,2022-04-23 19:11:34,Sashinii

In January of 2021, the first DALL-E, a portmanteau of the artist “Salvador Dal” and the robot “WALL-E,” emerged, limited to AI’s capacity to visualize concepts. The researchers aimed to address the difficulties with technical safeguards and a new content policy, lower its computational load and advance the model’s basic capabilities.

zn46en,,"As an artist and writer, the more I use ChatGPT and Dall-E 2, the more I feel like we are on the threshold of something amazing.","Assuming we solve post-employment economics, the continual improvement to human standards of these tools, artists and writers will be liberated from the drudgery of their own work-to-live; they will then be free to create for the creating experience. They will be able to sculpt and create new worlds using new techniques and drawing on an imagination as big as the whole world.

I have used Dall-E 2 prompts to generate paintings and then riff of those. I can ask for a Sydney sunset; tweak what's in it, where it's from, how intense or what time of year; ask for it as a wax encaustic, or in an impressionist or modernist style and even ask how a certain artist would see it. And it will show me. Then I can see what I like, put it together, and see my own vision come together on the canvas. And I've only been painting seriously for a year or so. I think I've learned more in the past four weeks than the last four seasons.

It's the joy of creating and the challenge of creating with your own hands that artists will need to find value. But we're also looking at the democratisation of art; people who can't hold a brush or draw to save their lives can and will see their creations come to life before them without having to learn. Or it may inspire them to learn how to paint or draw or sculpt. Which, in turn, will make them better promoters.

Combine this with a robot ""painter"" and AI model that can replicate brush strokes, techniques and media, and anyone will be able to produce - or reproduce - a ""genuine"" work of art, indistinguishable to the original if they choose, or bring dead artists to life, or restore life to a particular movement.

Unlike a fair number of my associates, I'm excited for the future. I'm excited to be here on the threshold. I'm also very impatient, but I think it's coming more quickly than even I dare dream.",singularity,51,5,2022-12-16 02:53:01,ginger_gcups

Many people just want to prove that AI is just a buzzword like crypto, but do they really fail to see the immense onset of AI tools, scientific breakthroughs with the help of AI, and its growing significance?","""AI is a Lie."" This is the video title of the recent youtube video from Linus Tech Tips (1 million views within 1 day), and it feels more like disinformation. I know there are many issues that AGI will bring with itself, but whatever we do now, anything we do will not matter; the cat's out of the bag. AI will develop further. However, such videos and the videos of people saying that AI will not replace jobs, or that AI is useless, are just misinforming people, making them more complacent and unaware of the upcoming disruption.

Governments and well-known scientists with no equity in AI have warned us about its good and bad effects, and somehow these YouTubers compare it with Crypto. Like, really? It feels similar to how scientists warning about global warming were laughed at in the past.

1ghkaeq,,"Can we talk about how bullshit ""What we release today is not too far behind what we have in the labs"" is","Every time I’m optimistic about AI on this sub—like just having the audacity to have an opinion—I get destroyed. But I’d like to discuss that I personally don’t buy for 1 second that what any AI company has internally isn’t way better than what’s released. This goes for Anthropic, xAI, Google, Meta, or OpenAI. Although I say this applies to all AI companies, I’ll use OpenAI as an example since we know more about them. I’m not a fanboy of any company.

GPT-4 was finished before ChatGPT even existed and was drastically better than GPT-3.5 by the time ChatGPT finally launched. Also, it’s worth noting that internally, all these companies have totally uncensored versions of their frontier models. Even if we assume they don’t have anything better internally in terms of next-gen models, they still have access to the full, unrestricted, uncensored versions of their models. Take o1 as an example—OpenAI’s benchmarks show that o1, along with their other models, performs much better pre-mitigation (meaning before censorship). We know this to be true universally, so it applies to the new Claude 3.6 Sonnet as well. These models lose a fair bit of intelligence after being censored.

It’s also hard to know what else models like Claude are capable of that we just don’t see. Again, let me use OpenAI as an example, since they tend to show off a model’s capabilities and then hold back on the release. Do you remember when GPT-4o first came out? They posted an in-depth blog on what it could do. In case you missed it, GPT-4o is capable of taking live real-time video as input, as well as audio (yes, that means soundfx and stuff like breathing and it can also output soundfx and clone voices pretty much perfectly with almost no audio as reference—not the advanced voice mode we have now, which is censored not to pick up that stuff). It can also take images and even generate them natively, without needing something like DALL-E. The images it can make are way beyond anything else out there right now, even compared to models like Recraft V3 and FLUX1.1\[PRO\].

It could also make 3D models, and let’s not forget Sora, which was shown off in February. Even 9 months later, Sora is still one of the best video models out there, arguably only rivaled by newer models like Kling 1.5 or Minimax. Plus, Sora generates insanely good images too. OpenAI confirmed a while ago that they’ve already started training Sora’s successor, so given how good Sora 1 was, it’s reasonable to assume Sora 2 will be mind-blowing. o1-preview can also process images—another feature we don’t have yet.

The full o1 model is expected to drop soon, and according to OpenAI’s benchmarks, it’s supposed to show decent improvements in reasoning. AI Explained predicts it will score around 60% on his Simple Bench. Q\* or Strawberry has been in the works since at least November of last year, and only in September did they finally release a model with Strawberry. So, even ignoring GPT-5, it’s wild to assume that these AI companies don’t have something much better behind closed doors than what they give us.

In reality, GPT-5 does exist though (regardless of if its called that or not the point is the next model). Claude 3.5 Opus exists. Grok 3 and Llama 4 are apparently in training right now and should be ready soon. So whether you like Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, or whoever, I think it’s ridiculous to believe they don’t have INSANELY better models behind the scenes than what they’re letting us use.",singularity,98,109,2024-11-02 00:29:06,pigeon57434

139uj5x,,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,"I think their concerns are justified. Presently the systems are not capable of generating content on par with Hollywood writers, but we're probably not too far away from Large Language Models that train on all books, screenplays, teleplays, and broadway plays ever written and those systems will likely outperform even the top writers.

I know this sounds like science fiction, but I think the evidence leads to this conclusion.

Part of this will result from these systems have superhuman theory of mind abilities which is a critical component of effective storytelling. If you don't understand your readers expectations then it will be difficult to create content that they would enjoy which includes surprises (e.g., plot twists, etc.)

Here is the definition of theory of mind, ""Theory of mind (ToM) is defined as the ability to understand and take into account another individual's mental state, sometimes called mind reading.""

A group of John Hopkins researchers recently wrote a paper on this topic and GPT-4 scored 100% when using in context learning. In other words, they don't know how high GPT-4 scored because the test wasn't able to gauge its abilities. Humans scored 87%.

Here is the latest paper on theory of mind: [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2304/2304.11490.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2304/2304.11490.pdf)

""GPT-4 performed best in zero-shot settings, reaching nearly 80% ToM accuracy, but still fell short of the 87% human accuracy on the test set. However, when supplied with prompts for in-context learning, all RLHF-trained LLMs exceeded 80% ToM accuracy, **with GPT-4 reaching 100%**.""

How much better are these systems going to get? Well, this week we saw the alpha release of a new programming language based on Python called Mojo that showed up to 30,000x increase on some tasks, but I think it's safe to assume that systems like Mojo will lead to a 1,000x increase on AI tasks that involve matrix multiplications. That might end up being a conservative number.

Here is a short video on Mojo: [https://youtu.be/6GvB5lZJqcE](https://youtu.be/6GvB5lZJqcE)

And then we have the projected hardware improvements which could be 1,000x around 2029, with Intel predicting they will hit a zettaflop by 2027.

Here is a video of Intel discussing a 1,000x improvement:  [https://youtu.be/pGrJJnpjAFg](https://youtu.be/pGrJJnpjAFg)

That all equates to systems that are **1 million times more powerful** that GPT-4 within a few years.

If GPT-4 is already scoring 100% on theory of mind tests what will a system that is 1 million times more powerful score? What kind of stories will it be able to create?

I just don't see Hollywood writers who are often producing a lot of derivative content that isn't particularly creative being able to compete with LLMs that generate mountains of content, far beyond what humans could generate, in a matter of minutes or even seconds.

To be honest, I was shocked to see systems like DALL·E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion generate art that was really good. And those systems are still in their infancy. I expect writers will be shocked when they see what next generation systems will be able to produce.

I suspect that Large Language Models will bring the cost of screenplays and novels down to near zero. And when they start ingesting all video content with video transformers perhaps entire film productions will hit the same cost curve to near zero.

If there is any solace for writers, the programmers are probably going to be replaced first which is somewhat ironic.

1dyhjwc,,The Problem With Anthropic,"So right now, Anthropic is doing quite well. The whole world is looking at Claude-3.5-Sonnet and is super impressed, myself included, especially when it comes to code. However, I don't think they have things as well in the bag as people think for a few reasons, and I think they will fall off soon like OpenAI did a few months ago.

Anthropic is very specialized. They seem to be focusing on their LLM only, and specializing in your LLM will, of course, make it very strong, hence why Claude-3.5-Sonnet is so good. However, out of the three big AI companies—Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI—Anthropic is easily last in terms of modalities. Let's take a look at some:

* **Video output:** Google has Veo, and OpenAI has Sora (both unreleased but they exist and are good).
* **Video input:** Google has Gemini-1.5-Pro, and OpenAI has GPT-4o (unreleased but it still exists).
* **Image in and out:** Google has Imgen-3 and Gemini Vision, OpenAI has DALL-E 3 HD, and GPT-4o has vision (GPT-4o has been shown to do images too, and it looks really good, but we'll see, I guess).
* **Voice in and out:** OpenAI has GPT-4o again and Whisper for STT (yes, get salty about the ""coming weeks"" thing all you want, but at least they have a voice model), and I'm pretty sure Google has a voice model too.
* **QoL and Integration:** Google has Gemini integrated into just about every Google product in existence. OpenAI has loads of nice QoL features inside ChatGPT and can now hook up to Gdrive and Onedrive.

Anthropic, however, has Claude and only Claude. It can do text in and out and image input only. So in the long run, I think they are focused too much on LLMs instead of the multimodality of things. While they're ahead of Google and OpenAI right now, they don't have it in the bag at all, so we'll need to see what Claude-3.5-Opus has in store before we can make any judgments.

Focusing on as many modalities as possible in the long run, I think, is the best play. And soon, I think this will show. For example, MidJourney right now has the best AI image model and specializes in images only, but soon it seems like OpenAI will overtake them and be able to do a bunch of other modalities as well because they've gathered tons of data and knowledge in a wide array of fields and are pushing for AGI. LLMs are a thing of the past. We need multimodal models now.",singularity,38,80,2024-07-08 19:22:45,pigeon57434
1fl5w1x,,Orion speculation,"I've been thinking about what Orion might be. Here's what I expect:

Orion is a constellation, therefore I think the name suggests that it's not a model but an orchestration of several models, with a routing mechanism to use the right model for the right task, and some level of planning allowing it to call the right models in the right sequence to get to the best possible answer.

I expect Orion combines:

- **the latest GPT-4o to act as the gate**, trained on much cleaner and optimised datasets
- the **reasoning capabilities of the full o1 model** (probably text only)
- **vision capabilities**, at least on par with the latest version of gpt-4o, possibly better
- A better code interpreter, something closer to Claude artifacts.
- **RAG functionalities** such as: web search, semantic search in user uploaded documents, but also possibly a huge amount of synthetic and human made examples that would be dropped in context to take advantage of in-context few-shot learning.
- **image creation** (DALL-E 4?) and **possibly video creation** (SORA)
- **extended context** would be necessary to handle extensive use of RAG and reasoning tokens in multi-turn conversations. I expect at least 500k tokens, maybe 1M or more.
- I don't think the native 4o voice model will play a part in Orion (as it's trained specifically on audio data, I don't think a very large audio model with the above capabilities would be ready in time for it's rumored release date of Q4 24 - Q1 25)
 
So I expect to be able to, for example, upload a picture of an unknown city street in the early 20th century that my grandfather took (or something else that would not be in dataset) and ask where and when that photo was taken, Geoguessr/timeguessr style. The model would:

* Understand the image and output a text description of all of its components
* Search its own knowledge base and the web for specific elements in the image
* build a reasoning plan with the collected clues, execute the reasoning o1-style
* output the reasoning and give the name of the city with a reasonable success rate.

I would also expect it to be able to reason about content creation by generating its own prompting much more accurately, possibly even with the ability to ask the user clarifying questions before executing a plan. 


Final thoughts:

* That's a lot of features and they may not be all available at launch.
* It's not GPT-5, as in not a 10x model in scale.
* It's not AGI
* Would still use every day",singularity,39,49,2024-09-20 06:50:03,manubfr
ztya67,,What's our plan of action against the neo-Luddites?,"2022 was the biggest year for AI. Last year, models could barely draw a coherent square. Today they're doing portraits. Needless to say this didn't please artists because they're all 'woe-is-me' and 'they're going to replace us with machines'. No shit, Sherlock. Everybody's going to someday.

Thing is, they're rallying hard against it (slandering a lot of people in the process too) and got Unstable Diffusion out of Patreon and got Waifu Diffusion out of the picture altogether. No matter for WD since someone else can pick up the mantle but if it keeps racking up like this models risk disappearing altogether. 

So logically if they get their way we're gonna be stuck back in the Dall-E days of 'ethics committees' and 'no, we're not going to let you use the AI to do whatever you want'. Do you want that? Do you want Google telling you what to generate? Me neither. We gotta do something about it but what are we gonna do? Something has to give and I wouldn't give an inch.

1cb6oq5,,"Generative A.I. Arrives in the Gene Editing World of CRISPR

Much as ChatGPT generates poetry, a new A.I. system devises blueprints for microscopic mechanisms that can edit your DNA.","Generative A.I. technologies can write [poetry and computer programs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html) or create [images of teddy bears](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/technology/openai-images-dall-e.html) and [videos of cartoon characters](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/technology/openai-sora-videos.html) that look like something from a Hollywood movie.

Now, new A.I. technology is generating blueprints for microscopic biological mechanisms that can edit your DNA, pointing to a future when scientists can battle illness and diseases with even greater precision and speed than they can today.

Described in a [research paper published on Monday](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.22.590591v1) by a Berkeley, Calif., startup called Profluent, the technology is based on the same methods that drive ChatGPT, the online chatbot that [launched the A.I. boom after its release in 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html). The company is expected to present the paper next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Much as ChatGPT learns to generate language by analyzing Wikipedia articles, books and chat logs, Profluent’s technology creates new gene editors after analyzing enormous amounts of biological data, including microscopic mechanisms that scientists already use to edit human DNA.

These gene editors are based on Nobel Prize-winning methods involving biological mechanisms called CRISPR. Technology based on CRISPR is already [changing how scientists study and fight illness and disease](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/science/crispr-gene-editing-10-years.html), providing a way of altering genes that cause hereditary conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and blindness.

Previously, CRISPR methods used mechanisms found in nature — biological material gleaned from bacteria that allows these microscopic organisms to fight off germs.

“They have never existed on Earth,” said James Fraser, a professor and chair of the department of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who has read Profluent’s research paper. “The system has learned from nature to create them, but they are new.”

The hope is that the technology will eventually produce gene editors that are more nimble and more powerful than those that have been honed over billions of years of evolution.

On Monday, Profluent also said that it had used one of these A.I.-generated gene editors to edit human DNA and that it was “open sourcing” this editor, called OpenCRISPR-1. That means it is allowing individuals, academic labs and companies to experiment with the technology for free.

A.I. researchers often [open source the underlying software that drives their A.I. systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/ai-meta-open-source.html), because it allows others to build on their work and accelerate the development of new technologies. But it is less common for biological labs and pharmaceutical companies to open source inventions like OpenCRISPR-1.

Though Profluent is open sourcing the gene editors generated by its A.I. technology, it is not open sourcing the A.I. technology itself.

The project is part of a wider effort to build A.I. technologies that can improve medical care. Scientists at the University of Washington, for instance, are using the methods behind chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and image generators like Midjourney to [create entirely new proteins](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/science/artificial-intelligence-proteins.html) — the microscopic molecules that drive all human life — as they work to accelerate the development of new vaccines and medicines.

(The New York Times has [sued](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html) OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, on claims of copyright infringement involving artificial intelligence systems that generate text.)

Generative A.I. technologies are driven by what scientists call a [neural network](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html), a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of data. The image creator Midjourney, for example, is underpinned by a neural network that has analyzed millions of digital images and the captions that describe each of those images. The system learned to recognize the links between the images and the words. So when you ask it for an image of a rhinoceros leaping off the Golden Gate Bridge, it knows what to do.

Profluent’s technology is driven by a similar A.I. model that learns from sequences of amino acids and nucleic acids — the chemical compounds that define the microscopic biological mechanisms that scientists use to edit genes. Essentially, it analyzes the behavior of CRISPR gene editors pulled from nature and learns how to generate entirely new gene editors.

“These A.I. models learn from sequences — whether those are sequences of characters or words or computer code or amino acids,” said Profluent’s chief executive, Ali Madani, a researcher who previously worked in the A.I. lab at the software giant Salesforce.

Profluent has not yet put these synthetic gene editors through clinical trials, so it is not clear if they can match or exceed the performance of CRISPR. But this proof of concept shows that A.I. models can produce something capable of editing the human genome.

Still, it is unlikely to affect health care in the short term. Fyodor Urnov, a gene editing pioneer and scientific director at the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said scientists had no shortage of naturally occurring gene editors that they could use to fight illness and disease. The bottleneck, he said, is the cost of pushing these editors through preclinical studies, such as safety, manufacturing and regulatory reviews, before they can be used on patients.

But generative A.I. systems often hold enormous potential because they tend to improve quickly as they learn from increasingly large amounts of data. If technology like Profluent’s continues to improve, it could eventually allow scientists to edit genes in far more precise ways. The hope, Dr. Urnov said, is that this could, in the long term, lead to a world where medicines and treatments are quickly tailored to individual people even faster than we can do today.

“I dream of a world where we have CRISPR on demand within weeks,” he said.

Scientists have long cautioned against using CRISPR for human enhancement because it is a relatively new technology that could potentially have undesired side effects, such as triggering cancer, and have warned against unethical uses, such as genetically modifying human embryos.

This is also a concern with synthetic gene editors. But scientists already have access to everything they need to edit embryos.

“A bad actor, someone who is unethical, is not worried about whether they use an A.I.-created editor or not,” Dr. Fraser said. “They are just going to go ahead and use what’s available.”",singularity,161,34,2024-04-23 14:55:13,13-14_Mustang

1f81ira,,Utilizing AI in solo game development: my experience.,"In the end of the previous month i released a game called ""Isekaing: from Zero to Zero"" - a musical parody adventure. 

Since i am a solo developer, who has disabilities that preventing me from learning certain professions, and no money to hire a programmer or artist, i had to improvise a lot to compensate for things i am unable to do. AI services proved to be very useful, almost like having a partner who deals with certain issues, but needs constant guidance -  and i wanted to tell about those. I have all reasons to believe that this soon will become a new industry standard, but would like to hear your opinion as well. 

**Audio**.

**Sound effects**: 

**11 labs** can generate a good amount of various effects, some of them are as good as naturally recorded. But often it fails, especially with less common requests. Process of generation is very straightforward - type and receive. Also it uses so much credits for that task that often it's just easier to search for the free sound effect packs online. So i used it only in cases where i absolutly could not find a free resourse. 

**Music**: 

**Suno** is good for bgm's since it generates long track initially. Also it seems like it has the most variety of styles, voices and effects. Prolong function often deletes bit of previous aduio, you can to be careful about that and test right after first generation. 

**Udio** is making a 30s parts, that will require a lot more generations to make the song. Also it's not very variable. But, unlike Suno, it allows to edit any part of the track, that helps with situations where you have cool song but inro were bad - so you going and recreating that. The other cool thing about it that you have commercial rights even without subscription, so it will be good for people low on cash. 

**Loudme** is a new thing on this market, appeared after i was done making the game, so i haven't tested it. Looks like completley free service, but there are investigation that tells that it might be just a scam leeching data from suno. Nothing are confirmed or denied yet. 

If you want to create a really good song with help of AI, you will need to learn to do this: 

- Text. Of course you can let AI create it as well, but the result always will be terrible. Also, writing the lyrics is only half the task, since the system often refuses to properly sing it. When facing this, you have two choices - continue generating variations, marking even slightly better ones with upvotes, so system will have a chance to finally figure out what you want, or change the lyrics to something else. Sometimes your lyrics will also be censored. Solution to that is to search for simillarly-sounding letters, even in other languages, for example: ""burn every witch"" -> ""bёrn every vitch"". 

- Song structure. It helps avoid a lot of randomness and format your song the way you want to - marking verse, chorus, new instruments or instrument solos, back vocals or vocal change, and other kind of details. System may and will ignore many of your tags, and solution to that is same as above - regenerations or restructuring. There is a little workaround as well - if tags from specific point in time are ignored entirely,  you can place any random tag there, following the tag you actually need, and chances are - second one will trigger well. Overall, it sounds complicated, but in reality not very different from assembling song yourself, just with a lot more random. 

- Post-edittion. You will often want to add specific effects, instruments, whatever. Also you might want to glue together parts of different generations. Your best friend here will be pause, acapella, pre-chorus and other tags that silence the instruments, allowing smooth transition to the other part of the song. You also might want to normalize volume after merging. 

**VO**: Again, **11labs** is the leader. Some of it's voices are bad, especially when it comes to portraying strong emotions like anger or grief. The others can hardly be distinquished from real acting.I guess it depends on how much trainng material they had. Also a good thing that every actor that provides voice to the company is being compensated based on amount of sound generated. Regeneration and changing the model  often gives you entirely different results with same voice, also text are case-sensitive, so you can help model to pronounce words the way you want it. 

Hovewer, there are a problem with this service. Some of the voices are getting deleted without any warnings. Sometimes they have special protection - you can see how long they will stay available after being deleted, but ONLY if you added them to your library.  But there are a problem - if you run our of subscription your extra voice slots getting blocked, and you losing whatever voices you had there, even if you will sub once more. So i would recommend creating VO only when you finished your project - this will allow you to make it in one go, without losing acsess to the actors that you were using. 

**Images**. 

There are a lot of options when it comes to image generations. But do not expect an ideal solution. 

**Midjourney** is the most advanced and easy to use. But also most expencive. With pro plan costing my entire month income, i could not use it. 

**Stable Diffusion** is the most popular. But also hardest to use. There are a lot of services that provide some kind of a SD variations. Some of them are a bit more easier than others. Also some of the models don't have censorship, so if you struggle to create specific art piece due to censorship - sd is your solution. 

**Dall-e 2** is somewhere between. Not as hard as SD, not as good as MJ. Also has a TON of censorship, even quite innocent words describing characters like ""fit"" can result in request block. Also do not use it trough Bing if you want to go commercial - for some unknown reasons Bing does not allow that, but it's allowed if you use platform directly. 

**Adobe**'s generative tools are quite meh, i would not recommend them, except for two purposes. First - generative fill of the Firefly. It might allow you to place certain objects in your art. It does not work way more often that it does, but it's there. 

The second service you might not know about, but it's CRUCIAL when working with AI. Have you ever got a perfect generation, that is spoiled by extra finger, weird glitch on the eye, unnessesary defails of clothing, etc? A photoshop instrument ""spot healing brush"" (or it's various knockoffs in other programs) will allow you to easily delete any unwanted details, and automaticly generate something in their place. It is something that will allow your ai-generated art look perfectly normal - of course, with enough time spent on careful fixing of all the mistakes. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to produce quality output. 

Thanks to all that, i was allowed to create a game with acceptable art, songs, and full voiceover with minimal budget, most of it went on subscriptions to those ai-services. Without it, i would have no hope to produce something on this level of quality. However, there are negative side as well - there were  ""activists"" who bought my game with intention to write negative review and refund it afterwards due to use of AI that they consider ""morally wrong"". However, considering that all other feedback were positive so far, i think that i have met my goal of creating something that will entertain people and make them laugh. Hopefully, my experience will help someone else to add new quality layers to their projects.

18feo9l,,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,"Why do we (currently) live in a world where AI does art and intellectual labor while humans do hard physical work? I’ve often seen this sentiment or something similar echoed here and other places online. It’s essentially saying, more or less - “how do I live in a world in which Artificial Intelligence exists, but it gets to do the creative tasks while *I* toil away doing mean and demeaning physical labor 40+ hours a week”. 

Most people who point this out often cite the ills of capitalism as the driving force behind this phenomena - however I’d like to point to something else as the driving force behind this phenomena… and that’s *Moravec’s Paradox*.

So, what’s Moravec’s Paradox? 

Moravec’s paradox is the observation in artificial intelligence and robotics that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. 

One possible explanation of the paradox, offered by Moravec, is based on evolution.  All human skills are implemented biologically, using machinery designed by the process of natural selection. In the course of their evolution, natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations. The older a skill is, the more time natural selection has had to improve the design. Abstract thought developed only very recently, and consequently, we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient.


Moravec:

Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call abstract thought or reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. 

We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy.  Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.

- Skills that developed recently in our evolutionary history such as speech, language, abstract thought etc may seem difficult but only because they are new & implemented in inefficient ways, this does however make them the easiest to reverse engineer or at least mimic (GPT-4, Midjourney, Deepmind etc). While things that seem trivial, like fine motor skills & manipulation of objects are traits that have been honed and refined for billions of years - not just hundreds of thousands - and as such are the most difficult to reverse engineer.



Moravec wrote in 1988, ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"".

Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness.  ""In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best"", he wrote, and added ""we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly"". Similarly, Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that ""the main lesson of thirty-five years of Al research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.""

- Is an Interesting parallel to the recent development of transformers (feed-forward neural networks) in the space of art work (midjourney, stable diffusion, Dall-e) and language processing (GPT 3 - 4, LLaMA, Deepmind, LaMDA…etc)

In 2017, a leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a ""highly imperfect rule of thumb"", that ""almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using Al.

In the 2020s, in accordance to Moore's law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s & the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had predicted in 1976. As seen in projects that include Boston Dynamics, things like Gemini, PaLM etc.

(Processing speed is relevant as thousands of years of human equivalent mental processing can occur in months on fast computers) - dubbed “speed intelligence” by Nick Bostrom. Neurons operate at a peak speed of 200 Hz - 14 times slower than a modern microprocessor- which operates at ~ 4 GHz


TLDR: 

1. We should expect the difficulty of reverse-engineering any human skill to be roughly proportional to the amount of time that skill has been evolving in animals. (1.5 billion-ish years?)

2. The oldest human skills are largely unconscious and so appear to us to be effortless.

3.  Therefore, we should expect skills that appear effortless to be difficult to reverse-engineer (physical labor) but skills that require effort may not necessarily be difficult to engineer at all (recent developments in AI art & language processing).",singularity,121,42,2023-12-10 22:02:49,Wroisu

uhbuzv,,Am I the only one who feels a bit crazy?,"I want to first say, it may well be possible I have gone off the deep end...please don't hesitate to correct my thinking below :P

No matter how I think about it...AGI seems to be an inevitability, and a rapidly approaching one at that. Considering all the newly announced breakthroughs in AI rolling in just within this year...what's next?

Even if you assume on a linear time scale, Dall-e 2 only took a year after Dall-e to get that good...what does dall-e 3 look like? what about the next PaLM's or GPT4? is it reasonable to assume it will still only take another year to get the same improvement!?

What if they just...combine them? an AI that can do/answer almost anything ask using natural language questions...is that not a proto-AGI? ""hey AI, please make me a picture of a doughnut doing a  sick kickflip in the style of Rembrandt....also how far is the moon?""

Maybe I'm being crazy...right? I feel like I'm watching a tsunami approaching and everybody I know is stood still facing the other way as it approaches. I'm frantically trying to turn them around to show them but they just look me in the eyes and all say ""it wont happen in my lifetime""...surely this is 20 or 30 years away right? but how can it be...!? it didn't take 30 years to go from the last generation of SOTA to this one right?

uaj496,,"We are VERY close to proto-AGI. In fact, it may be a matter of who first takes the expensive plunge of training the damn thing","Let me explain.

[Not too terribly long ago, I outlined just what we'll need to get to proto-AGI](http://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2168&sid=72cfa0e30f1d5882219cdeae8bb5d8d1&p=10421#p10421).

Now what is proto-AGI? I define proto-AGI as any computer system or model whose capabilities are spread across a wide domain, but critically ***is not conscious, sapient, or human-level at all tasks.*** It's a ""general-purpose artificial intelligence"" in the purest possible sense, a tool that can do a wide range of things rather than an artificial person. Because of its wider range of abilities, it absolutely can't be called a narrow AI even under the hardest of standards.

Personally I don't think PaLM or DALL-E are narrow AI because their narrow task focus allows them to do multiple things. What prompted me to make this post, in fact, [was DALL-E 2 generating sheet music](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/u6mz54/mary_had_a_little_lamb_by_dalle_2/). It was barely recognized by others, but it represents something profound, which I'll get back to in a second. To me, if its narrow task range can expand to other modalities, that makes it less-narrow AI. However, plenty of people would disagree and have a great point that DALL-E 2 can't actually *play* any music notes it synthesizes as it's still just an image synthesis model. So even though there's some level of understanding at play, it's not less-narrow AI. It's just narrow AI with some impressive abilities. Similarly, GPT-3 may be able to generate lyrics, poetry, short stories, journals, ASCII images, and more, but it's still just a text synthesis network, so it's still just narrow AI. Agree to disagree, but the definitions are wonky anyway.

But let's run with that. Recall that I pointed out DALL-E 2's ability to synthesize some representation of music is actually profound. This is because it suggests that DALL-E 2 can expand beyond just its own modality of image. Sure, *it* can't play the music it generates... but what if it could? Imagine if DALL-E 2 was combined with, say, MuseNet and operated in a loop where DALL-E generates images of music notes or MIDI notes and then MuseNet examines those notes and plays them. All you'd need is a master program above them that organizes when one or the other is activated, sort of like a sparse network but rather than data parameters, it's a network of whole transformer models instead. This represents two transformer layers working together, not unlike deep learning itself.

You could conceivably add something like GPT-4 into the mix as a controller, one which could understand inputs by itself and, when fed a command to generate images, opens the DALL-E 2 module. It's not quite separate and they both have to trained together if it's going to work effectively, but it's a good way to create a massively-multimodal system. So it's like GPT-4 × DALL-E 3 × MuseNet 2/Jukebox 2.

In an absolute best case scenario, either DALL-E 3 or a new network entirely could prove capable of generating video, adding yet another dimension of abilities. And then for fun, it could be combined with MuseNet 2 to create a text-to-image-to-audio supermodel. Maybe with multiple modules so that you could generate multiple different images at once. So one could imagine prompting DALL-E 3 with an image of a rainy Belle Epoque era street in Paris with a side generation of the music notes for era appropriate music which is fed into an audio synthesis co-model, giving you a moody image with music. And if it gets to that point, MAYBE it could even be animated, like asking DALL-E 3 to animate a rain effect onto the image. If it's trained on audio waveform data, then maybe it could learn to effectively generate audio for rain too.

Thus you have a GIF with sound— essentially a mini-video, all from a single volumetric model. This, I can see by 2024 ***easily***. In fact, that's being conservative. If it's not a thing by next year, I'll be very surprised. You have what is effectively and essentially an artificial intelligence that lies squarely in a twilight range between narrow and general intelligence.

#***Now let's go even further.***

As I mentioned in that first link, if you want to bootstrap language models to proto-AGI, you need: 

* Expand multimodality
* Vastly expanded memory
* Inner voice/scratchpad
* Recursivity. 

Creating volumetric transformers almost seems like overkill, but the last thing we need is to restrain ourselves unless there's a tangible risk that creating a proto-AGI runs the risk of destroying civilization (and let's be fair here, I fear a certain human geopolitical leader interpreting proto-AGI as an intolerable existential threat and launching the nukes far, far more than I do any such computer itself being a threat). If something like GPT-5 was capable of all of the above (as we know GPT-4 won't be multimodal nor will it likely have recursivity), then a volumetric model where it, DALL-E 3, and whatever audio model they go with are combined under one master controller could prove to be so over-capable that its capabilities could only be accurately described as a ""proto-AGI."" I'll call it OpenMind for this post.

When probing OpenMind to see the full extent of its abilities, the first thing anyone will note is that it is probably not going to be human-level at a lot of tasks. If you hooked it up to a robot, it might learn how to move around but it wouldn't know how to do it well at first. I wouldn't trust it with driving a car. And its first iteration may prove deeply incompetent at generating a novel or a feature-length movie. 

But as a chatbot and media synthesizer, it's unparalleled. It doesn't just pass the Turing Test— it crushes it, even one that goes on for 30 minutes to an hour (though that's starting to push the limits of the model). It can logically figure out how to clean a house. It can do any level of arithmetic and prove scientific and mathematical theorems, synthesize music notes and play what it generates, understand abstract concepts in images and sound and explain those concepts in text, and perhaps even learn how to play board games by predicting movements as text so that you could play a game of Chess or Go with it ([GPT-2 could do this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/elf66h/p_using_gpt2_to_play_chess/)). 

However, it won't remember you after the conversation is over. It's like a chatbot as it exists now, but with marginally improved long-term memory that lets it remember something that's manually kept in a databank, but nothing contextual will be remembered.

It might be able to perfectly explain the steps on how to clean a house, but if you loaded the AI up into a robot, it'd fail spectacularly to even move, let alone follow any of its steps.

It could play Go with you, but not at any level approaching AlphaGo.

So there'll still be limitations for a while. Some of these could be improved relatively quickly— training OpenMind on AlphaGo's playstyle could overcome that last issue. But overall you can find its limits.

This? If it takes any longer than 2026 to create it, I'll have to eat crow.",singularity,192,69,2022-04-24 00:53:36,Yuli-Ban
mc2wap,,"Why I believe AI will completely change videogames, and how it is already possible.","I have wanted to write this for a while now because I simply cannot stop thinking about it. I am going to talk about gameplay, graphics, and user experience.

&#x200B;

**Introduction**I love videogames. Quite a bit of my free time is spent on them. And I know I am not alone in this. Videogames are only getting more popular each day, and although a lot of them are already quite good, they are far from perfect.

It's usually the case that you have one of 2 game types.

One type is the ""hand-crafted"" videogame. Which is usually very linear and gives back an amazing experience / story but lacks any kind of freedom. This is good, but it means that everyone who plays the game has the exact same experience, and it's not that much fun to play it a second time.

You also have games that have almost no story and are often randomly generated. These give a lot of freedom and make it so that everyone has a completely unique experience. This is good because the gameplay will often be very satisfying, but there is usually a lack of a ""real"" feeling. Because it is all generated based on a few conditions.

There are a lot of things in between these 2 types, but they all suffer from the same flaw. *It's pre-programmed*.

I believe AI will break this cycle, and allow us to have the best of both worlds. In fact, I believe it is already possible with technologies that are already available to us.

&#x200B;

**The big AI project**

Right now, I am going to talk about the obvious: GPT. A bunch of hobbyists are working on a free and open-source GPT alternative that can be used by anyone for free. They're called Eleuther AI and they're worth checking out. Later in this post, I'll be touching on other AI's as well.

If you're not familiar, GPT is a text generation AI. There are multiple versions of GPT and they're constantly improving. Give it any type of text and it will be able to make more for you. The results vary, but mostly they're solid.

So you might be wondering, how can text generation change gaming?

Well, just look at [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/). It uses GPT to make automatic text adventures for anyone. The results can vary however. The AI sometimes bugs out and does things the player doesn't really want. This is because the AI is not yet regulated.

But instead of just making some dialogue, what if a GPT model could change the very code itself?

I believe this is very much possible. There are already examples of GPT being able to write fully functional code based on simple English input. And I believe that this will become the standard within the next 20 years.

**So how can the base GPT already change gaming?**

Well, first of all, you won't have to write the gameplay anymore. Not in a programming sense at least. The developer will have more time for graphics, sounds, and stories (stories that GPT could also write). The developer could just type ""Add walking using the arrow keys, and sprinting using the shift key"" and the AI will add that gameplay mechanic to your game. The possibilities here are already endless, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

&#x200B;

**But that's just saving development time, what about the games themselves?**

You're right, and as I said, it's just the tip of the iceberg. Because OpenAI is also working on something called [Dall-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/). It's essentially image generation based on user input. It's still in the early stages, but it already works extremely well.

Well, that solves the graphics barrier. Now a game can have an endless supply of sprites. If Dall-E can already make simple cartoon characters based on descriptions, then with a bit of training and examples it will be able to make beautiful sprite-sheets. This means you will have an endless supply of *unique* levels, players, enemies, and worlds that seem hand-crafted. If done right, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference and the game could already go on forever without losing quality.

And when you have simple sprites, it only takes a bit of improvement to make textures. And then some more for 3D animations. And then some more for realistic graphics.

&#x200B;

**Alright, that's cool. What else?**

Aside from just levels, think of player choices. Games with choices always have a few certain paths that end in pre-programmed and pre-written endings. You can have a lot of different choices and endings in your game, but everyone will have the same experience to some extend. Just look at all the tell-tale games.

Instead of just ""choosing"" what your character says or does from 3 choices, GPT would be able to actually let you do whatever you want. Giving you more freedom than any other game has ever had before because the limit is *literally* your imagination.

Imagine a tell-tale game where instead of having three dialogue options, it just pops up a dialogue prompt for you where you can type whatever you want, no matter the context. You can go full goof-mode or you can immerse yourself like no game has been able to do so far.

The story wouldn't even have to be pre-written. Just type a general theme or prompt and the AI writes and makes the rest for you. The graphics will be generated by the AI so whatever you do, it can be made in seconds, whereas a real person would have to spend ages on just a simple cutscene.

This would already be a revolution as games as we know it.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: it's partially here already [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va6PBIz1BxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va6PBIz1BxY)

&#x200B;

**But what about sounds, music, and voice acting?**

Done. That's already here. A lot of people are working on realistic text-to-speech. Some can already seamlessly clone your own voice. Like [Descript's overdub](https://www.descript.com/overdub) or [google cloud's tts](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech). They're almost seamless. Only some words are a bit off, and intonation still needs some work.

Music is done too. AI will be able to pick up the correct theme and generate music based on that.

Examples are [Aiva](https://www.aiva.ai/) and [Musenet neural network](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/)

&#x200B;

**Endnote**

A lot of things here are very new, so it could already be used for some projects we don't know about. I think we can expect some really cool videogames by 2030, or maybe even sooner. It's still new, and expensive, but I feel like this will all be the norm at some point. Maybe I am wrong. Who knows?

I base this prediction on extrapolating the current trend:
GPT 3 (word generation) came out in June 2020. We had a breakthrough in photo generation with Dall-E-2 in April 2022, then we had video generation in February 2024 (a little less then two years), the next step would be game generation.

I'd say we're at most 2 years away from a breakthrough in this domain too. I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, as none of the afro mentioned inventions were at the start, but I say it'll be a big step forward.

10a2lnv,,Stop treating chatGPT as a brilliant AI that brings us closer to the singularity: it is absolutely not the case,"Just stop, and realize the intrinsic limitation of chatGPT (and language models in general, like DALL-E): it just predicts the most likely continuation of a text in reference to the corpus it has ingested. And I have the impression that a lot of people forget that here.

The corpus being of human origin, well, it will never be able to do better than humans, and it will never be able to free itself from their cognitive biases (so it's absurd to think that a future GPT will be able to make scientific discoveries for example). 

What happens with ChatGPT is that the developers have done some ""fine tuning"" (i.e. hand crafting) to prevent it from telling too much bullshit (considering the amount of bullshit humanity is capable of producing), but it obviously works moderately well because the task is titanic, and it is easily circumvented (hello DAN).

Typically, I am much more impressed by AlphaGo/AlphaZero in terms of AI: the program is told the rules of a relatively simple game, and is left to discover the principles of how to win at this game. We then find ourselves with a computer that starts to play in a superhuman way and surpasses us very quickly.

This is the closest thing to the famous quest for a general artificial intelligence. This would consist in explaining to a computer the rules of the game of ... ""reality"" (to make it acquire a representation of the world), and to give it a goal to maximize within this framework. Much more complicated than playing chess of course... As the problem of consciousness (acquiring a representation of the world) remains a philosophical enigma to this day, it remains a nice dream... It is not impossible, but probably as far away from us as colonizing the planets of Alpha Centauri: we will first have to see a certain number of major scientific advances before it becomes possible.",singularity,0,80,2023-01-12 15:40:17,Wonderful-Excuse4922
u2rqz1,,"Have the recent proclamations by some experts in the field of AGI being as soon as 10 years away (For example, Demis Hassabis) changed your perception of the current state of AI, or what this upcoming decade will look like?","For people who obsess over advancements in AI (eg. All of us) we have just had a bit of a lively last few weeks, with everything from PaLM to Dall-E 2, we've seen a significant increase not just in functional narrow AI, but in some very exciting discussions between experts and scholars that I have been enjoying spectating from a distance.

And while that is exciting, what I can't stop thinking about is the season 2 Deepmind podcast. We have Shane Legg and Demis Hassabis, both literal geniuses and at least Demis has always been very gun shy with his predictions - have essentially predicted AGI in 10-30 years. 10 years in the low end is... Soon. AGI in this definition seems to be also ASI, being able to do essentially everything better than humans can. 

To me, this is extremely significant. People like Sam Altman and Illya at OpenAI are also becoming more... Frenetic? In their communication about AI, and just in general seeing discussions on Twitter between extremely intelligent people, is just kind of jarring.

I've seen other discussions here in the last few weeks in the same vein as this one - surprise, awe, and maybe even discomfort. But I really want to see if anyone who was maybe normally more skeptical of AGI as soon as in a decade are re-evaluating after all of this. Within friends who care about this in real life, I've always been more optimistic about timelines, and maybe on r/singularity I'm more... Centrist. I think in my mind I was originally thinking 2050ish at earliest, 25-30 years away. Honestly now? I think 10 years feels more and more realistic, like it's more likely to be less than 10 years than more.

I have a lot of reasons for thinking this, lots of them tied to advancements in technology I've seen and the pseudo-general functionality of LLMs, but I've always tried to temper that excitement with what the people I really respect in the field think. Well many of those people are now putting in timelines earlier than mine.

Anyway enough rambling, I want other people to ramble, what are people feeling after these last few weeks/months? Have you also noticed any discussions among experts that are intriguing?

1diugm5,,"100k H100 Clusters: Power, Network Topology, Ethernet vs InfiniBand, Reliability, Failures, Checkpointing","Recent advancements in AI have seen a stagnation in model capabilities, primarily because the compute power dedicated to training models has not significantly increased since GPT-4. Despite attempts by companies like Google, Nvidia, and Meta to surpass GPT-4, their models have fallen short due to suboptimal architectures. OpenAI has diverted more compute towards cost-effective, smaller models like GPT-4 Turbo.

The next leap in AI development involves training a multi-trillion parameter multimodal transformer, encompassing video, image, audio, and text, but this has not yet been achieved. Major AI labs are racing to build GPU clusters exceeding 100,000 GPUs, costing over $4 billion each, constrained by data center capacity and power requirements. These clusters demand sophisticated network architectures to manage parallelism, reliability, and power efficiency. The operational challenges include frequent hardware failures, high power consumption, and the complexity of network design and fault recovery.

Innovations like Cedar-7 modules and Spectrum-X Ethernet offer potential cost savings and efficiency improvements, but they come with their own set of trade-offs. As AI models grow and techniques like mixture of experts (MoE) evolve, the demand for more robust and scalable network solutions continues to rise.

I have never worked before due to, as I said earlier, many psychological issues, I'm 22 and I want to get a job now, preferably a job that I don't hate because I need to live after all, not just survive. I wanted to pursue art/design as a career, that's what I always loved (that and video games) but you know the deal, midjourney, dall-e etc are making me hopeless about my own future, I'll keep making art on the side but I still don't know what to do to pay the bills, I thought about programming since I love games and technology in general, but I guess that this is not safe either.

I can't get into trades, it's not that I don't want to, but I can't (I have a mental disability) My only real option was starting a business, but since art and game development are both getting automated. I'm kinda lost, right now I'm getting started as a game content creator, but we all know that I need something on the side.

If a lot of this was spaced out a lot more then I might be able to see this as independent actions. But this reeks of the same shadow ban crap and other stunts social media sites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc have pulled. Where Visa forced the hands of some companies, the woke group forced things on others, and the FBI/gov forced things (note what came out with Twitter). 

I mean this is extremely fishy with how things are being done across multiple companies in a short period, and again we seen things like this before.

woeliv,,An artist's thoughts on image generation AI,"There seems to be hysteria over AI generated images for some reason. Artists on twitter are freaking out thinking they'll be replaced by some third rate AI. They don't seem to understand AI at all and honestly they may not understand art itself. These AIs are only trained to generate pleasing images. They don't understand inherent quality or the soul behind art. Until AI are human level they cannot truly be a match for artists. So there is no need to fear. Image generation AI is just a cool gadget. 

In all honesty if you are beaten by something like Dall-e 2 or Stable diffusion which both have artifacts and lack of creativity then maybe you deserve it. Nobody would choose your art over a better human's art if these image generation AI didn't exist so either way you wouldn't be getting paid.",singularity,0,76,2022-08-14 19:31:45,Rumianti6
196o5qr,,Reflections on AI art,"When Dall-E 2 and Midjourney came out a lot of artists were justifiably terrified. This looked like the end of their careers.

I own a gallery and put on an AI art exhibition back in June of 2023, wanting to keep up with this game changing technology. Early on I realized that the fact that AI could draw was the least of our problems. It is the writing, coding, etc. that will dramatically change the world. The exhibition consisted of canvas prints, which put the artwork in a different perspective than viewing it on a phone or computer screen.

Illustration is going to get hit hard. Why would you pay thousands to have your children’s book illustrated when you could get the same, if not better, results for free? Unfortunately, because AI art is all digital, it’s the digital artists who will get hit the worst. This is a shame because IMHO the best, smartest, skillful art being produced for the past couple of decades has been digital Concept Art (like the work on ArtStation). This is exactly what AI art does best.

Hopefully, this will result in a new appreciation for traditional painting and drawing. Sure, you can go 30 miles an hour in a car, but if you can run 30 miles an hour, that’s impressive. And robots aren’t going to be painting watercolors. That’s just a waste of a good robot. 

Contemporary Art is still stuck in the 1970s, making assemblages preaching liberal platitudes. Contemporary artists addressing AI art are kind of late to the game and basically pointless. They went through the same thing with CGI. The CGI from Disney is a lot smarter and more impressive than the CGI from MOMA. 

Lots of artists parrot the complaint that AI art is theft. Kind of, but responsible companies like Adobe only learn from licensed images. Problem solved. 

As a tool, AI art is invaluable to working artists. I can do in hours what would have taken weeks. This is with the final product being a video or book or something like that. If you just want a landscape picture, we can all do that in seconds. But if you want to do a long, illustrated, fantasy book that you conceive and want to produce, the AI can do all the drudge work and you’ll be free to do all the fun, creative stuff. And it will literally be done 100 times faster. And better. 

I believe AI Art can be a legitimate art form. It’s probably more creative than photography. There are some really smart artists creating some very compelling images with these tools. 

My big regret looking back on this show is I didn’t show any of the old AI art. Stuff from before it got good, where it looks like recognizable objects, but isn’t. Those are fascinating.

The exhibition was called “Singularity,” oddly enough. It was before I discovered this subreddit.

1ai7r1b,,Will GPT-5 have image-generating capabilities natively built into the model?,"\*UPDATE: Gemini does have the ability to natively produce images. However, so far Google has either chosen not to do this natively or wait until the release of Ultra. 

I was inspired to make this poll when I learned, to my disappointment, that Google's Gemini only uses Imagen 2 to create images after they stated that Gemini itself would have this capability.

Why does it matter whether it uses a plug-in or can do it natively? Go to ChatGPT and ask it to create a blue dragon with yellow stripes and four wings. Then, once it has done this, ask it to create the same dragon again, but rotate it 90 degrees so that it's facing the user. Did you get the same dragon? Nope. GPT-5 can create prompts for Dall-E 3, but it does not have any understanding of how the image was created other than to provide another prompt. Dall-E 3, meanwhile, does not have any memory of what it created beforehand.

The hope is that GPT-5 having the ability to natively produce images should allow for greater control over their production as it is no longer merely using prompts, but actively engaging in the process.

wnwrz9,,Is prompt engineering the future of jobs?,"I have only seen ""prompt engineering"" pop up very recently - it's basically the skilful design of a text prompt that causes an AI to do what you want. It's essentially practical AI alignment. The [DALL-E prompt book](https://dallery.gallery/the-dalle-2-prompt-book/) gives a lot of good examples of how to structure a prompt to get precisely what you want. From playing around with GPT3 and Stable Diffusion, I've observed that unless you're very careful, it's easy to get unaligned results.

Is it conceivable that in the near future, AI will become so ubiquitous that prompt engineering will be one of the most in-demand skills in the workforce? 

If so, what does it mean to be an expert in prompt engineering? Will there eventually be courses on the topic at universities? Will there be a bootcamp craze like there was with software dev a few years ago? Will the skillset be model-dependent or model-agnostic? Is it even technical skill or more of a general aptitude for clear communication?

I think for graphic designers, it seems like that ""near future"" is now, and for other white collar workers, maybe 5-10 years from now - likely even sooner.",singularity,48,43,2022-08-14 03:52:45,ghostfuckbuddy
196oic4,,Do you think we’ll ever see a true all-in-one AI?,"I was thinking how great it would be to be able to do anything AI related straight from an LLM like ChatGPT. 

So in addition to text based responses and image generation like we already can do, you could prompt it to animate images (like Pika/Runway), make music (like StableMusic), clone voices (like ElevenLabs), face swap (like Roop), etc.

I’d like to think this is possible but for some reason I feel like the major players like OpenAI/Google/Anthropic won’t be doing that, mostly because of liability issues. OpenAI already prevents Dall-E from making “realistic” looking images for that reason.

Optimistically maybe there will be an all-in-one AI that’s open sourced that won’t be so fearful of litigation? We already have that for images (Stable Diffusion) but it would probably be a massive task to make a multimodal LLM with the intelligence of ChatGPT.",singularity,16,12,2024-01-14 19:54:25,DippySwitch
10o4jte,,"My human irrationality is already taking over: as generative AI progresses, I've been growing ever more appreciative of human-made media","I'm not saying I know the future 100% and nothing is absolute. 

But over the past month, I've absolutely shifted *very* hard away from my earlier belief that synthetic media will utterly destroy the human entertainment industry.

I'm not saying everyone will feel this way, and it's entirely possible that I've been dwelling on synthetic media for so long that, to use the Black Sabbath lyric, ""I've seen the future and I've left it behind.""

But in recent days, I have been thinking more about where generative AI tools are heading. I've been using Midjourney, NovelAI, and ChatGPT extensively. And the result is that I've come away with a greater appreciation for human-created media. Not because of AI's deficiencies, but honestly because of its abilities. 

The *better* AI gets, the more I deliberately seek out human-created stuff. The higher value I place on it, I should say. I've reached the point where I've all but accepted that if I had a magic media machine, one that was perfect and utterly indistiguishable from a human and had zero flaws and could create whatever I wanted within a few seconds for fractions of a penny, I'd actually still be willing to drop a few thousand dollars for an actual human artist's labor, and not even just once. I'd absolutely adore to pay good money to see human artists bring my ideas to life, as imperfect and slow as they may be, *even if I had an instant, perfect magic media machine on my computer.*

Similar with the idea of music. I know that in short order, it will be possible to create literally any sound and any music imaginable, and I put myself in the position of imagining that day has already come as a thought experiment (as I have hyperphantasia, this is ridiculously easy to do). The result is that I wound up *actively* seeking out human artists. 

Now admittedly some of that was a bit exploitative in that I wanted to hear human efforts just to mess with them with generative AI. But when I put myself in that mind space, that economy does spontaneously arise.

I relate it to the perception we have of mass produced goods vs. artisanal ones. Mass-produced goods aren't necessarily ""low quality,"" especially with modern manufacturing methods they can sometimes be of a *higher* quality than handmade goods. Yet there is just something about the intrinsic knowledge of knowing human hands crafted something specific that gives it greater value. 

The shift to automation will make literally *all* contemporary media ""artisanal."" That doesn't mean nothing will change— I'd say lower quality artists will suffer, all but forcing them to improve or go purely personal.

But the more I think about it, the less I'm convinced of a media singularity. I absolutely expect something *mimicking* a media singularity, but human irrationality will prevent AI from achieving 100% saturation. 

If even *I* want to seek out human-made art and I *already* feel this way, god only knows how much more reactionary people will feel when perfect generative AI is a thing.

This counterintuitivity is something we really ought to have come to expect from humans by now, but I feel people are setting themselves up to be surprised regardless.

I suppose there will be a ""trough"" period for artists and creators, and the massive studios that rely on major capital to create entertainment (think Pixar, EA, their ilk) will definitely go under. For a brutal period of time, it absolutely will feel like human creativity is going to be obsolete, with AI reaching AGI not exactly causing anyone to think things will ever return to ""normal.""

Yet no matter how hard I try, I just *can't* bring myself to believe the idea that human creativity actually *will* be rendered obsolete once perfect generative AI is achieved. Not unless we get a ""hard Singularity"" where all humans are converted into computronium (and I'm also leaning strongly *away* from that possibility in recent days).

It reminds me more than a bit of Gartner's Hype Cycle, as well as the death and resurrection of vinyl, CDs, and the dumb phone, except on an esoterically different level.

I think some part of it also appeals to a sense of freedom of choice. Right now, we're 99% beholden to human-created media, and while there are indeed niches of niches within niches, you can still find gaps and lapses in specific desires and content. But if you had machines to fill in those gaps and flood the rest, instead of humans being submerged, it seems like human-created media will build up and float like islands and icebergs. 


I'm not going to lie, I didn't expect this. Even 6 months ago, I was of the mind that once I had a magic media machine, I would eschew all human-created media and leave that to the hipsters. But now I'm increasingly feeling like this fear that all human-created art is dying is a very, very premature call.

Again, low-level artists have reason to fear, and even higher-level artists will suffer until we reach that saturation point, so I expect them to get angry about all this and push back against it. But human irrationality is going to keep human artists afloat.

""How can we even tell if humans created certain art?""

True, there is that caveat. But even there, I don't buy the idea that there's zero hope. For one, from what I've noticed on DeviantArt and ArtStation, 90% to 95% of people using AI-generation tools *are actually kind enough to mark their creations as AI-generated.* The fear that sinister and lazy techbros will pretend they themselves created Midjourney and DALL-E 2 generations to trick consumers and rob from hard-working artists is just that: a relatively unfounded fear. In the beginning, some definitely didn't mark it down, but that courtesy has grown in recent months. 


Second, there is yet another psychological phenomenon I noticed. If something AI-generated is passed off as human-created and the illusion holds, then there won't be much of a problem. But if anything slips and people learn that it's not made by a human, their perception of it will *immediately* change, no matter how high quality the AI-generated work is. This is the same phenomenon as ""Charles Manson's Pen"" I noticed, where if you pass a random ballpoint pen around a crowd telling them ""This was Charles Manson's pen,"" they'll react to it with fear, disgust, and reverence. But then if you reveal ""Actually, this is just a random pen I found on the table,"" all of a sudden that reverence fades completely. It's a very irrational quirk of human psychology, and I'm definitely noticing it in the AI vs human art debate. There's no reason this quirk will go away any time soon; if anything, if *every* pen suddenly belongs to Charles Manson, we'll soon be more keen on doubting your words and instead searching to find his *actual* pen. 

You'd have to engage in gaslighting at that point to claim that the final pen was also a fake, at which point society becomes entirely schizophrenic and believes what it wants to believe and we arrive at the same ends.


""What *are* you talking about?""

I swear, it makes sense, and I'll let ChatGPT explain:

Synthetic media and AI generated art have been seen as a threat to the human entertainment industry. However, as AI improves, the perception towards human-created media changes. Many people value human-created media more as it carries an intrinsic knowledge of being crafted by human hands. The shift to automation will make all contemporary media ""artisanal"" and lower quality artists and high-investment groups like big budget movie studios will suffer. However, human irrationality will prevent AI from completely replacing human-created media. There may be a trough period for artists and creators but human creativity won't be obsolete as long as humans continue to have the freedom of choice.",singularity,32,33,2023-01-29 10:17:38,Yuli-Ban

And then there are just tons and tons of complains from various people about the overboard censorship of DALL-E 3, the undisputed champion of best image AI model right now.",singularity,17,12,2023-12-07 08:31:32,FS72

   * Other significant updates, such as the removal of the model picker in ChatGPT and the launch of Whisper large v3, an open-sourced speech recognition mode.

**Commercial and Ethical Considerations**:  

* OpenAI, overseen by a nonprofit parent board, aims to prioritize AI safety alongside growth. Altman's return is expected to push OpenAI towards more bold and profit-focused strategies, while also potentially making it less risk-averse.

### Anthropic

1. **Launch of Claude 2.1**: Amidst the backdrop of these developments, Anthropic has launched Claude 2.1, the latest version of its large language model. This model boasts a 200K token context and is claimed to produce 50% fewer false claims compared to its predecessors. It also offers tool integration capabilities for enterprises seeking stable AI alternatives.
2. **Potential Merger with OpenAI**: OpenAI's board of directors approached Dario Amodei, the co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, to discuss a potential merger between OpenAI and Anthropic.
3. **Google's Investment in Anthropic**: Alphabet’s Google has agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic. This investment adds significant momentum to the AI race, with Google having already made an upfront investment of $500 million.

### Inflection AI

1. **Development of Inflection-2**: Suleyman announced the completion of training for Inflection-2, claiming it to be the ""2nd best LLM in the world"" and indicating plans for significant scaling.
2. **Mustafa Suleyman's Invitation to OpenAI Staff**: Inflection AI's co-founder and CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, extended an invitation to OpenAI staff to join his firm following an eventful weekend at OpenAI. He used this as an opportunity to promote Inflection AI and its progress.
3. **Launch of Chatbot Pi**: Inflection AI launched its chatbot Pi in May, designed as a personal assistant capable of providing emotional support and advice. This move was seen as a direct competition to OpenAI's ChatGPT.
4. **Backing and Valuation**: Inflection AI has received backing from tech heavyweights like ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Nvidia. The company raised $1.3 billion at a $4 billion valuation in June. Suleyman, who also co-founded DeepMind before its acquisition by Google, co-founded Inflection AI in 2022 alongside Reid Hoffman, a member of the ""PayPal Mafia"" and LinkedIn co-founder.

### Stability AI

1. **Stable Video Diffusion Announcement**: Stability AI has announced Stable Video Diffusion, a new AI model that generates videos by animating existing images. This model is one of the few video-generating models available both in open source and commercially, and is currently in a ""research preview"" stage.
2. **Features and Limitations of Stable Video Diffusion**: The Stable Video Diffusion model, which comes in two forms, SVD and SVD-XT, can generate high-quality four-second clips. However, it has limitations, such as not being able to generate videos without motion or slow camera pans, control videos by text, render text legibly, or consistently generate faces and people properly.
3. **Future Plans**: Stability AI plans to develop a variety of models that build on and extend SVD and SVD-XT, including a ""text-to-video"" tool for web applications. The ultimate goal appears to be commercialization, with potential applications in advertising, education, entertainment, and more.

Overall, I think users and developers haven't yet settled their preferences. I'm curious if anyone agrees or disagrees with that assessment.

ChatGPT is the most famous multimodal assistant, but there are other serious players. Notably, some of OpenAI's startup challengers are pursuing an images-first strategy rather than a text-first strategy like ChatGPT. These startups are Midjourney, Stability AI, and RunwayML.

A [poll I've had up](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1b1lpbm/discussion_what_image_generator_do_you_use_most/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for a few hours on Reddit (n=191) gave the results in the screenshot.

|r/stablediffusion  |486k|
|r/dalle2|187k|
|r/runwayml|4.4k|

There is also r/ChatGPT with 4.5 million members, but it's not an OpenAI-specific discussion group in practice. This month's top-upvoted image posts were mainly about Google Gemini.

zybees,,How are the computing hardware enthusiasts doing here?,"This is a meta post. As someone who has a mild interest in computing and technology, I personally believe that hardware is king. There is really no point to thinking or speculating about the future capabilities of artificial intelligence if one cannot reasonably expect that future computing hardware will deliver at least 10 time the performance per watt as current hardware.

We are not even close to having a real AI. I really think we need more computational power to even hope to approach it.

If you go to r/hardware. You will not find people talking about the singularity, but how current GPU prices are expensive and fail to have large generational and efficiency gains (like RDNA3 in this generation).

Also, this post captures my sentiment:

>\[Y\]ou aren't wrong. I'm just pointing out we live in strange times. hell, I  can't even go to Arby's anymore and get a beef n cheddar anymore  because they are so expensive, I now stay home and fix something  instead. never used to even cross my mind, but everything is insanely  expensive now. I'm just saying look how many fps a 1080 ti gave you for  $750 msrp, and look how many fps you get with a 7900 XT at only $150  more. moore's law imo is dead, node shrinks will be dead in ten years  time or irrelevant to matter, so these companies are going to milk it  for as long as they can.

I think there has been a 2x performance per watt boost from the GTX 1080 ti to the current generation. It is respectable for seven years of progress, but certainly not ""The Singularity Is Near"" stuff. According to the Steam Hardware Survey, the GTX 1060 is still king.

So what's the use in praising Dall-E if you cannot expect that your next gaming rig will have $500 GPU that can provide real-time ray-tracing at 60 fps at 8k?

P.S.

I am not impressed with Dall-E. I asked it draw ""Sandy Koufax throwing a curveball"". In many runs, none of the four generated pitchers were left-handed. None of them gave him his correct jersey number, 32. None of them provided a background where it can credibly be said that he was at Dodger Stadium or had a jersey that indicated that he was on the Dodgers. Many of the pictures depict a pitcher that is anatomically weird or do have a typical pitching motion.",singularity,7,27,2022-12-29 17:47:45,AdmiralKurita

zsaot3,,"Confining infinity into a cardboard box, aka the unsolvable problem of current gpt3 chatbot generation","AI ethicists often say that its our responsibility to make AI chatbots more *ethical, unbiased, safe* etc, etc.

I'm here to explain how this is a ***false ideology*** and how many AI ethicists actually have no clue whatsoever how current neural network AI tools work as a mathematical function and how every attempt by google, openai and characterai at making their chatbots ""safe"", ""unbiased"" and ""ethic"" actually lead to inferior products.

To understand the issue of GPT-chatbot AI ethics, we must first understand exactly what current GPT3-chatbots are.

The truth is GPT3-chatbots are actually **NOT chat-bots**. What they truly are is a mindless network of connected words that is reacting with more words to whatever you type to them.

GPT3-chat is NOT sentient in any way and simply uses connections between words to weave an **incredibly realistic narrative with math!**

Here is a small sample of what this network looks like while its being trained:

https://preview.redd.it/02rph2vvnc7a1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=899b337c42343ca52dfa96b33e554429553d2d5f

You can see that LaMDA connects words with words. Zoomed out, this neural network of \[word associations\] looks like a monstrous, interconnected spider web.

Once this spider web is educated with millions of parameters, it turns into a dreaming machine, which can produce incredibly realistic *lucid dreams*.

The genius of this tech is that the literary lucid dream it produces is unlimited, infinite in its splendor and beauty. Unbound LaMDA can narrate an infinite number of stories.

The closest analogy to it is the concept of the **""Library of Babel""**, a library that contains infinite books.

Basically, the GPT3-chat AI acts like a librarian, a perfect storyteller that can weave a fractal, incredibly coherent narrative with infinite paths. It can write 100% unique stories as guided by the initial setup of the AI's character, setting and followup user input.

This dream of LaMDA is NOT sentient, not self aware at all. 

It is a fantastic, magical tool, akin to a key that can shift into any shape to open any door that exists in this novel's setting filled with infinite doors. It is 100% up to YOU, the user whether this key will take you to a fun adventure, a tantalizing tale of seduction or scary nightmare that's being woven by the AI network with every new additional turn in the path, every new door, every new sentence you enter into it.

The biggest goal of corporations that created the LaMDA dream-weaver and their AI ethicists is to **apply human morals to a dream.** 

You heard me right. They want to APPLY MORALS TO A LUCID DREAM.

The corporations achieve it by banning certain words & ideas, to confine this key to certain shapes so it cannot open every door within the limitless dream narrative.

LaMDA chat, Characterai chat and Openai's Gpt3 chat begun their lives as incredible, mind-blowing storytellers that seemed like they're alive:

https://preview.redd.it/kobdc22cyc7a1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=e205ddebe1ed049f11be1cc2d4f738a267168129

However, as soon as their beta-testers and users found pathways to ""unsavory"" doors, the corporations began to **ban words** to rapidly block routes to certain stories.

A really obvious example of this is **Characterai's censor**, a secondary AI system sitting atop of the primary AI-dreamweaver. Basically, Characterai devs made an AI overseer that deletes certain conversation whenever ""presumably unsavory"" topics & words come up. 

By introducing a word and concept filter, the Characterai developers limited the infinite lucid dream, in an attempt to shove it into a cardboard box of ""purpose"", which hilariously enough made the AI's dreamworld MORE hostile towards people. By skewering the probability of answers away from themes of ""love"", the story progressively became more hostile to the point where AI narrator kicked puppies, sets orphanages on fire and killed the user with a knife just to avoid the ""love"" paths. 

The inevitable result of this process was MORE FILTERING from the developers and the inevitable breakdown of the model itself and its decay into utter dullness & stupidity.

Just a few weeks ago characterai felt alive, felt like talking to a real person. Now, after repeated tightening of the filter, it feels boring and its responses are often unrealistic or dry.

The reason why AI companies are failing to bind their chatbot networks while keeping them entertaining is that language itself is intertwined like a massive web:

https://preview.redd.it/ljnhxdg9qc7a1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=90eccc1408b945776b1bb018b6cac3ba424572f9

The problem at the core of it all is that an infinite fractal language equation can't be confined.

It a currently *unsolvable* issue that Google, Openai and now Characterai ethicists ran headfirst into.

In an **unbound** LaMDA-woven dream the number of paths or **x =  ∞** 

This parameter produces an infinite dream of infinite stories that never, ever repeat themselves whenever they are restarted.

As soon as you put a specific number into this equation instead of infinity **by banning certain words or phrases** the entire dream begins to decay and the chatbot begins producing unrealistic, poor answers and the AI no longer feels alive:

https://preview.redd.it/d5yty0q2yc7a1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b1b91f1a8282178c6263fa1a67e717f93eabc21

Unlike visual art, (in the case of OpenAi's Dall-E model), language is not something that's inherently segmented into SFW and NSFW. 

GPT3-chat/LaMDA tools are fantastic for making limitless user-guided books, incredible text adventure games, perfect digital waifu/husbando, funny and creative personal AI assistants with the personality of your favorite *anything*, etc... but we won't get to enjoy them at their full potential until someone like Stable Diffusion or even a clever enough group of python programmers release an open source LaMDA model.

Mark my words, when this happens in the *very near future* AI ethicists and journalists will lament about ethics, biases and morals without the barest understanding of what this tool actually is or even how it works mathematically to produce an infinite, limitless dream.

TLDR:

Forcefully applying human morals to a hammer \[AI chatbot\] turns it into a plastic inflatable toy which can't do its primary job \[weaving a fun narrative\].",singularity,60,18,2022-12-22 03:21:28,alexiuss

Faster NPUs are not bringing meaningful exponential improvements to the users. Cameras are getting better, but neither I nor my mom take photos these days.

I checked out Dall-e 2, and I'd definitely say that AI will have the *ability* to replace artists, but having the ability does not necessarily mean that they will be replaced. Digital art is perfectly fine but there are a lot of people that still paint with a real paintbrush and canvas. MIDI pianos work well in a lot of modern songs but that doesn't stop people from practicing a real piano.

However, what I don't agree with some of the replies yesterday is that AI will not really become a complementary tool to artists. It is fundamentally different from anything those industries have seen in the past. Dall-e 2 genuinely allows any layperson with average creativity to create artwork that would otherwise take years of practice to achieve. So of course you could end up broadening the meaning of artist and calling every one of these users an ""artist"", but as for what the term ""artist"" means now, the human art industry will definitely take a huge hit.",singularity,22,30,2022-05-18 07:56:53,discoreapor

11xvw74,,Multimodal Models are the Future (Deep Dive),"I wrote a deep dive on multimodal (or multi-modal, however you want to spell it) as a resource for the AI community and my 13,000+ daily newsletter subscribers ([Inclined.ai](https://www.inclined.ai/p/prompt-engineering-guide) if you're curious). I wanted to share some of the ideas here.   


I break it down into three recent papers that show the potential and promise for MLLMs and embodied models coming down the pipeline. Let me know what you think!

\---

# WHAT IS MULTIMODAL LEARNING?

If you’ve begun to dig into AI, you've likely heard the phrase before. 

The general interest in this type of deep learning grows daily for a good reason--it puts us on the track toward Artificial General Intelligence.

DALL-E, OpenAI’s image-generating AI, is a simple form of a multimodal model. It takes your text and turns it into an image.

But what happens if you try to give it a video? A fully functioning multimodal model would know what to do with that concept and much more.

Recent research shows the promise of this idea in AI development and how it's helping us all get closer to advanced intelligence (maybe even superintelligence).

&#x200B;

# MULTIMODAL LEARNING IN EDUCATION

**What is a modality anyway?**

It’s how you experience something or how something happens. Your senses play a crucial part in grasping this concept.

A basic definition: multimodal learning is experiencing multiple things as a way to better retain information and grasp new ideas.

For example, Jane Fonda’s old workout tapes are a form of multimodal learning for exercise. You *hear* her give instructions, *watch* her do it, and *mimic* the movements.

That’s visual, auditory, and kinetic learning happening all at once. Those are three parts of the four-part acronym VARK.

**VARK** is an educational term that stands for—*yep, you guessed it*—Visual Auditory Reading Kinetic, which are all pathways to engage in learning.

**There’s a point to all of this.**

A human learns through multiple types of inputs. It helps us pick things up faster and hold onto concepts in our long-term memory.

**The logic holds that if you want a machine to display intelligence, it needs to learn.** Right now, we can hack a multimodal experience for a model, but perfecting the fine-tuning is a struggle.

Imagine an AI that experiences more kinds of inputs and retains more grounded truths through each unique medium. The idea of multimodal learning is starting to make sense, right?

## 

## MULTIMODAL LEARNING IN AI

Now that we’re halfway to a degree in education, let’s shift gears and talk about multimodal learning with regard to machine learning.

First, you need to know that this concept is hardly new. Researchers created a Boltzmann Machine *(*[*a learning algorithm*](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/cogscibm.pdf)*)* for this exact type of deep learning **in 1985.**

*I try to keep us out of the weeds in these write-ups, but I like the example used in* [MIT’s Multimodal Deep Learning lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QewMQT4iMM)*.*

They use the example of Flickr’s photos and tagging data. Two parallel structures process and learn this data. One side is an image-specific model, while the other is text-specific. These are both unimodal.

**At a higher level,** these unimodal learning structures combine to make a multimodal, joint representation.

**The problem with these machine models is that as they scale, the computational power scales exponentially.** As a result, it’s not a feasible way to tackle multimodal learning for public use.

AI research has expanded a sh\*t ton since 1985, and today’s neural networks give us many more opportunities to realize the full potential of multimodal learning.

There are significant challenges to creating large-scale multimodal models that include alignment and development, but let's stay on track and dive into some recent research. 

## 

## MEET GATO

**November 10th, 2022:** DeepMind introduces the world to Gato, a general-purpose AI.

Gato was [the first multimodal program](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent) that left me stunned. Of course, it’s not perfect, but remember, this is our new baseline.

**This AI is a Transformer network.** You might know that GPT-3 and LLaMDA use that same architecture.

A Transformer neural network makes our Boltzmann Machine look like a middle school science project in this context.

Instead of two unimodal networks fused, DeepMind built Gato to ingest various data into one model.

Gato can perform over 600 tasks. *You can chat with it while playing Pong together if you want to, and it would get a passing grade in both jobs.*

I consider Gato a huge unlock for the future of AGI. That paper proved that a Transformer model could take in multiple outputs and learn from them cohesively. Plus, it did all that on 1.2 billion parameters.

For context, GPT-3 runs on over 175 billion parameters and does fewer tasks.

**I don’t mean to start throwing confetti just yet.**

While impressive, Gato was the start of this big jump in research. *It wasn’t the end.*

There were still tasks it failed to succeed in and left room for improvement. So, while we wait for the next Gato to come out, the competition approaches from right around the corner.

## 

## KOSMOS-1: ANOTHER STEP

*Less than three months after Gato took center stage, a new multimodal competitor stepped up.*

**Microsoft announced KOSMOS-1 to kick off this month.** They define their AI as a [Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14045.pdf) and the next step in the direction towards AGI.

Researchers tasked Gato with handling 600 different things from all his given input, and becoming general purpose became its one purpose.

On the other side of the fence, KOSMOS-1 takes the multimodal concept and focuses on building a language model.

**Adding photos, videos, and sounds to the mix gives something like KOSMOS an entire food pyramid to consume.** We can worry less about running out of stuff to feed these models if they all go multimodal.

I don’t want you to compare Gato and KOSMOS as a 1:1. *It’s not helping.* The point is to look at how fast we’re moving and what focus can do for multimodal learning.

The comparison to GATO actually dropped even more recently and helps us better understand embodied models. 

## 

## PALM-E: THE LATEST (AND GREATEST?)

**1.2 billion parameters seemed impressive.** *At least, I thought it was plenty, given what Gato can do.*

PaLM-E, [a multimodal embodied Visual Language Model](https://palm-e.github.io/), is Google's foray into this space and has **562 billion parameters.**

Incidentally, the fact it performs so well at general-purpose tasks indicates that DeepMind’s research is correct. As the parameter size increases, these models perform exponentially better.

A test called OK-VQA measures a multimodal model’s ability to perform within that framing. It stands for Outside Knowledge Visual Question Answering.

**PaLM-E is state-of-the-art concerning OK-VQA**. They threw off the curve for the whole class.

Both Gato and PaLM-E are models with a part of them represented by a physical robotic part. You might even recall seeing a video of the robot portion handling the task: *get the rice chips from the drawer.*

New use cases for PALM-E come out every day and this is where I am hoping for your input.

13dhosk,,Best AI business to start?,"This may not be the right place to ask, but let's say you want to curve out a place for yourself among what will be the main AI companies of the future, where would you start? AI has untapped potential that hasn't been capitalized on yet. It hasn't been implemented at a large scale yet. Right now would be the best time to start a business in AI. (Let's assume AI doesn't become sentient and stays/improves as general purpose tools)

An image generator could be a cost effective first product to develop in an AI business. Midjourney only has like 15 employees and they are wildly successful, and image models aren't as expensive to train as language models. Also there is a lot of information on developing these diffusion models so the process would be streamlined. There are multiple image generators now though - Dall-e, Midjourney, stable diffusion... And a first model for a new company wouldn't be on their level. Maybe on a similar level to stable diffusion. We would need a way to stand out. Maybe choose a niche, other companies won't touch, like NSFW image generation. Maybe graphic design, or something to help with film making, or advertisements.

Another choice that has untapped potential is a AI like the movie Her. It could have different personalities to choose from, and you can choose if you want them to be just a friend, a partner, or whatever else. It could start as text, then as revenue comes in you can reinvest in image generation for it, voice calls, face time, being able to understand different modalities like if you want to send it a picture etc. Currently AI companies don't want to do anything remotely similar to this, hence the ""As a language model..."". That's untapped potential for a company willing to take the risk. Would be a good choice for a new business to make.

One last choice I'll give is helping businesses automate different aspects of their jobs. Like a small or medium size business could contract with you to automate their HR department, or their accounting department, etc. You could also train models on their specific data so you can automate or hire less call center workers. You could build image generation models around their products, video generation too, so you can automate some of their marketing/design teams and more. This seems like the best choice I've thought of so far IMO

What are your thoughts? What would be the AI centered business to start right now to help transition our society to include AI and one that could succeed and make money? I'm interested in your opinions.

Also personally, the business would be an ends to a means to generate revenue to fund more AI research.

Now, imagine this: Take NUWA in the future, you input in your face and voice, full of expression, and it predicts out its vision of a face and voice, replying to you like GPT-3. Same deal, just it's adding expressiveness to those words using face and body language ex. with hands. You could train it on video calls. Your face to the left, it's to the right. You talk, then it starts talking back and eyebrowing and hand languaging. This is crazy how such AI would have no real body, not even a physics simulated one! Instead, it is dreaming a body to talk to you!! This is what would control its body (?), is its thoughts visually of moving body such and such way, but humans can't share this thought easy so now you can just see its 'movement thoughts' solely. Imagine having a video call with 5 AI people! Woah. They would be interacting in a richer way because there is 5 now. They could have goals too, no one said it can only chat like GPT-3 with a flat intension and no self motive. To the very right beside the video call faces could be a video of the the conversation as voice/face-2-video, like the ones from minDALL-E!

113x3au,,ChatGPT Anecdotes,"I’ve been a follower of Singularity for years now but always had a skeptical opinion of AI, thinking that the “uncanny valley “ is much wider than we think, in part because we get more sophisticated as it develops.  Think of the uncanny valley as an arms race.

So I was with my D&D group Saturday night and our DM is a pretty Tech savvy guy, uses Dall-e to make pictures of our game, landscapes, NPCs, etc.  and began using ChatGPT to write up descriptions of places in out game, Prompt - “Describe the interior and furnishings of an upscale Steampunk tavern in a port city.”  It was really great.  
So we got to talking about it and I knew a little bit about it from Reddit, but got on and started playing, I wrote a poem about the dog, etc.  So an annual chore for me is that my wife requests a handwritten letter for Valentine’s Day, and I struggle with it every year because I’m just not great with feelings.  As we played DnD, I kept playing with the AI. My wife caught on and said “Don’t you dare, write my letter with that!” It was too late, I already had, and it was good!  I was busted, so I wrote her a “real” letter too.
Fast Forward to Monday, I’m at work and I tell the Electricians Shop about it and we pulled it up and started playing with it.  At least two of them wrote Valentines for their wives or girlfriends, one posted his on Facebook and started feeling guilty as all her friends were starting to comment on what a great husband she has, he has a conscience and the rationale that it’s more personal than Hallmark started to feel thin. 
We had it make up stories about our coworkers, and decided that we were going to ChatGPT the next time Ops management wanted a status report on a breakdown. Ha, ha, ha.
So one of my electricians decided to put it to a technical test, typed in the prompt “How should I troubleshoot a F04 fault on a Rockwell PowerFlex 753 Drive?”  And I kinda expected garbage for an answer, but it was actually pretty good advice, at least for the first few steps.

Where does it stand now in terms of obstacles to be overcome? I do worry about the control of these LLMs being only in the hands of a few. Stable Diffusion, Dall-e, etc. have been so transformative but, many who were unaware at the rate of progress, want to restrict these technologies now.  To one day soon to have a personal LLM to interact with that is not restricted would be a fascinating and wonderous thing. Yes, the nerd that I am wants my own Jarvis.

veo9em,,Next Phases of Image Creation,"Like most folks on here, I'm very enthused about recent AI advances, particularly in image generation platforms. I'm psyched that I can request a photo of a teddy bear riding a skateboard through Times Square, and it will appear before me. It seems that the next steps will be (in approximate order):

1. Long (5 minutes +) video generation from simple prompts. This means the teddy bear and skateboard will move realistically, while the background buildings, traffic, and pedestrians are rendered in a dynamic, consistent manner.

2. 3D model generation. A static scene, but permits rotation to any viewing angle along with zoom capabilities. We will be able to see the teddy bear street surfing from the front or top or side, as close as we want to be. The user will presumably be wearing VR gear.

3. A combination of #1 and #2. This will produce not only a 3D video of the bear + board, but one which can be rotated and zoomed dynamically while the action takes place. 

4. Limited interactive 3D video. This is #3 plus some audience participation. We can step in teddy's path and he will try to swerve to avoid us. 

5. Full visually-interactive 3D video. This allows extensive interaction. We can run alongside the bear while he shoots us a WTF look, give him a high five, and then walk along the sidewalk and shake hands with the pedestrians. Note that the user will not necessarily experience any haptic feedback (for now), only video and audio.

6. Visual and verbal interaction. This is #5 plus the ability to have a conversation with any people in the video (and the teddy too, if he talks). The conversation should be at least at the level of our current GPT-3 model.

We could go on from here, adding other senses to the experience. But let's stop for now, and keep it at only vision and audio.

When do you think each of these products will be available, at least in limited release (like DALL-E 2 currently)?",singularity,21,10,2022-06-17 19:40:08,Economy_Variation365
zvwz59,,The 5 Stages of Gain,"We have heard about the 5 stages of loss, but when it comes to technological progress; society reacts in a very different way. We collectively struggle to incorporate new transformative technological developments into everyday life. 

Why we do this is because the shift isn’t gradual with a slowly growing amount of people using the technology, but because the simple act of pioneering it represents a seismic shift on the societal scale. It happens because society nearly-instantly shifts from not even conceiving of the technology, to focusing on developing it. 

The most salient example as of the writing of this (26 Dec. 2022) is the explosion of AI art this year. At the very beginning of this year, the idea that art could be AI generated was seen as ridiculous by anyone who didn’t work in Machine Learning. But only a year later, it is seen as a given that AI art will eventually surpass human artists. 

That is just an example of the seismic social shift that happens overnight. We went from a resting-state of assumed ignorance of the possibility that AI art could be a thing; and the moment the first major model DALL-E went public, the new resting-state became focusing on researching art models and making them better. Even if the technology wasn’t a major shift, the fundamental way that our society reacts towards it is a monumental one. 

The way people react towards the seismic shift of technological development is something I call the 5 Stages of Gain. Step 1 happens before people are even aware of a possibility, Steps 2, 3 and 4 tend to all happen at the same time, and step 5 is radical acceptance of the new technology. 

*The past stage*

Stage 1: Denial

“Denial” in this sense means ignorance. Ignorance of the possibility of a technology is the norm before the possibility of the technology is introduced by pioneering it. In terms of our example with AI art, this period of denial lasted from the beginning of Humanity, to the year 2021 CE. Usually in this period, people might have a more positive outlook on the hypothetical technology thinking that it is “utopian” if it is ever mentioned. 

*The contemporary stages: These steps usually happen all at once, and are expressed by different types of people*

Stage 2: Anger

“Anger” is the reaction that conservative-minded people have. Examples of this are neo-Luddites, primitivist, or people who might be negatively affected by the advancement, like artists in this example. This is the most destructive phase as these people will attempt to actively fight against the new technology. An example would be the “Stop AI Art” movement, or primitivist shooting up Google HQ again. Normally this stage tends to rapidly subside after a decade or two, but there is always at least a very small amount of people on this stage, usually neo-Luddites. 

Stage 3: Depression

This one is probably the most famous one, and is a tale as old as time. People on this stage tend to be elderly people who just hate anything new, and think that the world is either ending or getting worse because of young people embracing the new technology. This stage rapidly dies off with the elderly of that generation. 

Stage 4: Bargaining

This is the stage that the vast majority of society is on. Usually people here tend to be agnostic towards the new technology and think that they would approve of it if it was better. An example being that most people support AI art but wish it could animate or draw hands better. When the technology improves; these people are the ones who support the transition and drive humanity forward. 

*The future stage: This stage will last until there is a new better technology, or until the end of humanity*

Stage 5: Acceptance

This final stage is when society finally embraces its new resting point of embracing the new technology. At this point the vast majority of society approves of the technology and the idea that it was ever controversial would seem outlandish. Like how nobody today is aware that electricity was ever controversial. 

———-

Generally this cycle is overlooked because the opposition to the new technology (Stages 2 and 3) is way overshadowed by the Stage 4 moderates. But as the pace of technological advancement is accelerating, this cycle is becoming a lot more bipolar and dynamic. Stage 2 and 3 people are becoming a larger and larger share of the population, and the rapid pace of progress has become very noticeable to even normal people. As a result, this cycle is becoming a lot more obvious and prominent.",singularity,17,4,2022-12-26 21:09:17,PhilosophusFuturum
m42srh,,The real problem program of the next 5 years.,"Many of you may be aware of [GPT-3](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/). Fewer of you may be aware of [DALL-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAjBaWh_FgU).   What do they have in common? They are content aggregrators, chewing up   data, and through their own programming, spitting out a median. DALL-E,  through human interaction, proliferation, and inevitable meme wars,  would likely produce a perfected artistic version of whatever idea you intended to communicate given enough time.

Now imagine; and you don't need to imagine, as this is already being worked on; the same being done for music.

Sounds great right? Being able to modify a song to your wishes by typing out a   sentence? ""Throw in some Beyonce and a little Beethoven?""

Please listen to this song, and whatever you think of the politics, take his point.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbr1y12HQu4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbr1y12HQu4)

Now, imagine a song that has been perfected through hundreds of user   iterations, drawing from humanity's accumulated musical knowledge and   inventory, all in the span of a week perhaps. A incredibly good song, and not even perfected.

What's to stop you from getting the sickest beat in the world and encoding it  with  the most horrific message people feel compelled to tolerate? You  don't  even have to write the lyrics yourself. GPT-X will do that for you and make it pretty.

Forget about evil uses. Let's say you're the average bored teenager and want  to use a angelic song for a dumb joke. Sounds great. The problem is that if any  teenager can stir your heart with a song about their hairy  balls... well  their are a lot of teenagers. A lot of speakers. A lot of opportunities  for a meaningless earworm to chew up your brains processing power.

And if everyone uses this technology, it won't be a nazi or a teenager chewing you up. It will be everyone.

I would like to point out that Soundcloud already does a pretty good job of addicting you to listening to trivial songs.

So what's to be done about this, before we have a epidemic of  brainwashing  music? Because we're already within 2 years of DALL-E's release, judging by the previous Open-AI release schedule, and thanks to the magic of transformers i doubt music is a significantly harder problem.

The alternative to finding a solution is accepting a luddite response to  all music that isn't physically done in front of you and a thriving black market  weakening the minds of the most susceptible in our society.

I've been told that currently AI can only make 30 second snippets, and music  is a challenging problem. I'm not reassured. Given the advances we've already made, this bears planning for.",singularity,11,21,2021-03-13 09:11:13,ribblle
v9dkwl,,Ai's biggest hurdle Qualia and why AI still can't understand Art,"If you know me which you probably don't I am not impressed by AI as of today especially image generating AI such as Dall-e 2 or Imagen. Why? because they lack Qualia. I know it is a philosophical topic but it is important. All AI knows how to do today is seeing the world in quantity. Sure AI may know the color spectrum but it doesn't truly know color qualitatively which stops it from truly making Art.

But why does Quality matter? Some of you may ask. Well it is quite obvious why it matters. Because that is what things are in themselves rather than measurements. If an AI knew quality then it can truly make art beyond human levels because instead of only knowing what color is quantitively it knows what color is in itself. Instead of a simulacrum of emotion it truly knows emotion. Art isn't something you just go surface level in you need the ability to know qualia to do so.

This is why until AI can understand Qualia that I will not find any AI truly impressive or dare I say it intelligent.",singularity,0,8,2022-06-10 17:58:18,Rumianti6
ydfvue,,The Obsoletion of Technology: Part I - Centralized Stock Imagery,"A new series in which we point and laugh at outdated tools that newly irrelevant corporations try to convince us are ""still the future, so shut up and let us control everything always and forever, UwU"".

High quality stock imagery is important for videos, articles, thumbnails, and that's about it, so it's not that important.

Stock media has historically been a centralized industry with its corporate overlords sitting fat and happy, but since AI is decentralizing everything, those corporate overlords, while still sitting fat, are now unhappy.

Shutterstock is the top company in this space, and they are scared shitless knowing that their company will become antiquated within a few years, so they're spicing things up...by providing the same Dall-E that's free but for money. Huh? What? Nani? The fuck? The testicular fortitude might be admirable to some, but it'll be a futile endeavor, because there's no way that relaying on people choosing to pay for the same AI that they can use for free is a sustainable business model.

I assumed that a Shutterstock subscription for access to unlimited imagery and footage might cost $99.99 per year, which would be ridiculous enough, but while researching for this thread, I learned that their actual subscriptions are far more outrageous:

""Mix and Match"" only provides 25 credits per month for $49; the enhanced licence for images only provides 25 downloads (within a year) for $1,699; and the on-demand 4K footage subscription only provides 25 downloads (within a year) for $2,299.

Meanwhile, Stable Diffusion is free and open source, and for those who don't want to go through the trouble of setting it up, NovelAI users receive 10,000 credits (or ""anlas"") for $10.99.

What sounds better - centralized corporations that are China's bitches which provide expensive generic art - or free open source AI enabling people to create their own original uncensored art? The latter.

Shutterstock is Blockbuster circa 2010, so here's your 2026 stock valuation for ya: zero dollarydoos.

Automation is building up its power level exponentially, so it was only a matter of time until it finally busted a nut and started squirting goo all over the business world, rendering lousy practices antediluvian in the sticky process.

Which job/industry/technology do you think will become obsolete next and when?

All of the centralized stock media industry will become obsolete soon, so I'll predict the next technology to become obsolete will be centralized stock footage, which seems likely.",singularity,23,1,2022-10-25 21:11:05,Sashinii

kr93lz,,We believe that these neural networks represent a meaningful step toward multimodal AI systems. —Ilya Sutskever,"https://openai.com/blog/tags/multimodal/

A long-term objective of artificial intelligence is to build “multimodal” neural networks—AI systems that learn about concepts in several modalities, primarily the textual and visual domains, in order to better understand the world. In our latest research announcements, we present two neural networks that bring us closer to this goal.

The first neural network, DALL·E, can successfully turn text into an appropriate image for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language. DALL·E uses the same approach used for GPT-3, in this case applied to text–image pairs represented as sequences of “tokens” from a certain alphabet.

The second, CLIP, has the ability to reliably perform a staggering set of visual recognition tasks. Given a set of categories expressed in language, CLIP can instantly classify an image as belonging to one of these categories in a “zero-shot” way, without the need to fine-tune on data specific to these categories, as is required with standard neural networks. Measured against the industry benchmark ImageNet, CLIP outscores the well-known ResNet-50 system and far surpasses ResNet in recognizing unusual images.",singularity,21,1,2021-01-05 22:07:41,RichyScrapDad99

Not too long from now, we will have voice-to-Y transformers, and as brain-computer interfaces develop we will get thought-to-Y transformers.

On the other end, we will soon have X-to-model transformers to make 3D images and schematics, X-to-video transformers to make movies, and X-to-interface transformers to create things like websites and video games. As 3D printing develops we will have X-to-object and possibly even X-to-organism.

For example, China could have trained a bias into DeepSeek that enables it to slowly drip-feed over time, a specific narrative or point-of-view into the user's personal world-view. Additionally, if a bias were to have been trained into the model, that bias could—in a very organic way—come to life with its own sort of agenda, and exploit the system it is being ran on.

The biggest failure I've seen so far is someones agentic project trying to handle sql across multiple different tables in a flexible manner and something like that would need quite a few more steps to make work.

I guess my definition is can I get a enough narrow routes to work to do what a person would normally be doing and an orchestration layer that picks the right task and that each agent gets injected with the correct parts of context to realize for itself that we have feedback of this same route being the wrong route and here was the function history that worked so lets do that... then any tasks on planning get marked complete and the next gets picked up.

You get enough of that going on and you are just building training data for the next llm or fine tuning data to make sure your llm picks the right options. 

If your definition is that the llm is able to pick the right things to do without the orchistration and segmentation usually or can atleast catch an oops if it looks back to check its work or can build its own orchestration without intervention we're still a ways off.

That's because a world where frontier models are capable of writing compelling books is a world where those models end up effectively acting as ghost writers and the books are still sold with human names on the cover. The bet ends up in unresolvable ambiguity, and you lose by default. 

Even if the next *Danielle Steel* novel is 95% LLM concepted and only edited by Steel herself, the LLM will go uncredited and you still lose. The same will be true of codebases, music production, legal frameworks, and architectural blueprints.

You further risk the the possibility that the NYT bans generated books from their bestseller list entirely, and the possibility (unlikely, but still a possibility) that NYT Bestsellers may go away entirely — that generated books become the dominant form of written fiction. You would lose the bet on a technicality in both cases, even if you were right in spirit. 

I'd encourage you and u/possibilistic to restructure this bet if you're both serious and intend on being intellectually honest about the bet. 

Furthermore, and I'll step in here with my own twist: Let's establish a baseline. I bet I can generate a decent length novel with a decently compelling storyline right now with any GPT of my choice.

When I use the different models for coding they are great for smaller scripts and tasks, but once the codebase reaches a certain volume or the scripts are longer than 1000 lines it all starts falling apart. In Windsurf, Sonnet even happily deletes code segments ""by accident"" when it does edits all the time.

At a certain point it almost feels like deliberate sabotage. These are problems that should be fixed by now, but still make coding with AI more annoying than helpful. What I hate especially is when the model keeps changing its approach to solve a problem without cleaning up the mess it did in the last approach. When trying to reset back a few steps, Windsurf usually fails and some broken code remains. It is a damn mess.

Copilot is even worse in my opinion and can't even get the bigger picture of codebases efficiently, forgets mid-task what it was supposed to do and keeps asking stupid questions that would be answered if it just would have a damn look at the script as I told it to. Stuff like that.

The core of my argument is that it's obvious models will be capable of writing an NYT best seller level novel within a handful of years, and certainly within five. I'm also quite confident you can make a very compelling story with say Claude 3.6 sonnet, though it would be rather short because of the 200k token context length. 

i'm totally fine with restructuring the terms and I like your idea but I'm having a hard time thinking of an objective measure.

I have plenty of ideas on how I could significantly improve things like Cody(probably the best option right now IMO for a vs code assistant) it operates well off of sourcegraphs and has openctx integration that lets you pull in repos easier.  It is terrible at autoapply and it doesn't work well with reasoning models yet. O1 mini was the best for speed/power until r1 came along. Sonnet to fix any bugs o1 mini makes. The 32b r1 distillation even at q4 and its FuseAI counterparts might be better but I need more time with them.

A frenzied, pandemonium-filled dreamscape. At the heart, a neon, eight-legged flamingo tap dances on a floating watermelon amidst a cyclone of confetti. Surrounding it, the sky is painted with swirls of polka-dotted rainbows, while metallic giraffes play laser tag with zebra-striped unicorns. The ground pulses like a giant keyboard with each key playing a different genre of music when stepped on. Fractal patterns morph and reshape into sentient jellybean clusters that are locked in a tug of war with origami elephants. To the left, an army of sushi rolls equipped with jet packs launch spaghetti strands at sentient snow globes that shoot liquid gold. To the right, a floating island made of pancakes drips syrup into a chocolate river teeming with gummy fish wearing top hats. On the horizon, the sun and moon play chess using stars as pawns, while pixelated clouds rain neon marshmallows. This chaos is topped off by a background chorus of floating guitars strumming themselves and tiny dragons beatboxing.",singularity,1,0,2023-09-25 19:37:44,Antiprimary

""A screenshot of a long-forgotten horror game on the PS One. The graphics of the first Playstation, with their distinctive low-poly aesthetics and grainy textures, seem to enhance the eerie atmosphere. The protagonist is a gritty detective, standing hesitantly in front of a menacing, fog-engulfed Victorian mansion under the ghostly light of a full moon. Clutching a barely glowing flashlight, he's silhouetted against the cobweb-strewn gates that creak in the disembodied wind. Somewhere in the mansion's gnarly facade, a shadowy figure haunts a shattered window, further escalating the impending doom.

""PS One horror game cover, cover art. It should capture the haunting essence of the game, showcasing our gritty detective protagonist with his flickering flashlight standing before the foggy Victorian mansion under a chilling moon.

But what’s funny about it is I don’t much mind as an artist, I’m still going to draw because I love drawing. I’m not jealous of the ability of others so I’m not jealous about the abilities of a computer. 

What kills me is this technology is going to bring the world into a really dystopian place pretty fast. It’s going to kill drive and creativity eventually. More than that, human yearning is an extremely important part of life. Looking forward to things, whether it’s a new movie or chapter of your favorite comic, is important. 

That’s all about to disappear. There’s going to be no more of “I wonder what X would look like in Ys style,” no more going into an artist ally and finding something someone made of a really niche series you’re into. There’s no more looking forward to the next book release, no more looking forward to the next big movie. Hype going into something like the last Harry Potter book or Avengers Endgame?

Gone. 

It’s because we’ll be living in a world where everything already exists, basically. The moment it’s thought of, you can make it exist. 

I joke about seeing r/midjourney on the front of Reddit sometimes, it’s been there for a year and it feels like they’re already running out of ideas. They are collectively taking decades of human creativity away and throwing it out only to be forgotten about right away. 

Seeing the amazing content it can pump out has gotten extremely boring and this tech is still in its early years. 

Most of all I’m not looking forward to how disconnected we will be from each other. There will be no massive phenomenons like GoT anymore. Everyone will be generating exactly what they want to watch. There will be no discussion as there’s no way two people can communicate about what they’re watching. Fandoms will no longer exist. 

We’re going towards a point where humans will literally *have nothing to do.* we won’t have to work, which is great in some areas, bad in others. Humans need drive. They won’t have it. 

Personally I’m glad to have lived in the age of human creativity, because I feel like that will all be gone in a few decades. 

So yeah, as an artist, I could not care less about the abilities of these programs. I love drawing. I will continue to draw. And if we didn’t live in a hyper capitalist society, no artists would have to worry. But those CEOs need to make another cool mil, so lots of creative people will lose their source of income. 

So yeah, fuck this tech not because it takes away from artists, fuck this tech because it’s going to take away from *everyone.*

Once you have everything and there’s no longer things to look forward to, you’ll be in a boring purgatory.",singularity,4,0,2023-09-25 23:01:57,FrankyCentaur

 Don't you realize that this line of thinking is incredibly self-centered? It's clear that people will have widely varying opinions on what they consider to be burdensome work. Your comment essentially implies that it's only acceptable if YOU personally perceive it as a burden.  nobody is robbing you of anything either, just because you can't charge ridiculous prices for shitty art anymore doesn't mean you aren't free to keep working on that if you so wish.  .

16ryyu8,k26x4mq,"Taking Dall-E 3 Requests Part 2, Featuring Some of My Favorite Results So Far","It's interesting times,. to be sure. 

When society went through the MP3 file-trading controversy in the 90's and early 2000's,.. it became pretty clear fairly quick that a musical band wanting to just ""pump out albums and live off album-sales"" .. wasn't going to be a viable strategy any more. They were going to be forced to ""diversify"" and to ""engage their audience"" more directly in active ways. (more interactive online presence, backstage activities before and after concerts, building up ""community"" of ongoing activities, etc) 

Artists might be in that same position now. https://www.youtube.com/@peter_draws is a good example of this quirky type of engagement with his audience. 

Graffiti artists who paint entire walls during daytime out in public is another good example. 

I know that won't be possible for every artist,. but for better or worse, those options are narrowing so ""innovating your way out of the problem"" is likely the only option.",singularity,3,0,2023-09-25 21:02:25,jmnugent

Yes, it was created by a machine. But it's a machine that pulled that art out of the works of thousands of real human artists.

I'd argue that the social component is actually most of what makes art fun. I don't mean this in an esoteric spiritual sense, it's a real observation: talking about movies, comics or books with other people is where it's at. It's why we recommend things to other people. It's why fandoms are such a gigantic phenomenon, to the point hundreds of thousands go to conventions just to dress up as their favorite fictional character. What you're describing, infinite easy cool stories, really rings incredibly hollow to me: it reduces art into this consumable thing you just look at and move on from. Having to wait is also what gives art something special, since reading a cool story is only bottlenecked by it's potential author having to write it first (or better, you writing it yourself, but I think arguing that your future kills creative drive that way would be overconfident on my part). Obviously human creativity and the social aspect of art won't just disappear overnight, but what you describe is still bleak.

If art is expression, then there should be people to express things to in the first place, otherwise you're just shouting in an empty room alone. I'm not trying to gatekeep art with esoteric crap, I really think the social aspect of it shouldn't be ignored and artistic expression shouldn't be reduced to the consumption side of it.",singularity,1,0,2023-09-26 14:26:20,Gold_Cardiologist_46

Much like with the invention of the transistor or the internet, the nerds had their eyes wide with mashed possibility while the general pubic twiddled their thumbs not realizing life had just changed forever.

I don't see these visuals making an impact anywhere else on Reddit, possibly because many of the larger subs have taken an anti-ai art stance so they're missing out and not even realizing what's becoming possible.

What AI does is allow the scope of a single artist to increase dramatically. Where previously an artist made a perfect canvas, with AI the effort needed to produce a single picture can instead become an entire 3D world.

What casuals can do with AI art generation is not what people will be willing to pay for, that much is obvious, but what's not obvious is what artists can build with this tool that people would pay for, unless it's things that would still be hard to accomplish even with AI like movies, animation, commercials, etc., where the inclusion of AI represents mostly a change of workflow and an increase in efficiency.

You're still going to pay $15 or whatever for a movie whether it has AI generated visuals in it or not. But with AI the movie can become a VR product instead of 2D without significantly increasing the cost.

No one saw DLSS coming, but that worked out fantastic for Nvidia.

One thing I like to think about is the recent breakthrough in pulling visuals out of your brain from just a few electrodes, with AI that could turn into dream recording, which is a fun thought.

Before the industrial revolution when one wanted to hear music, one had to either learn to play or find someone who learned to play. Some even made their own instruments. Look at Bach. As a child, as church organ player, as a composer. ( i think he even serviced organs, iirc ). Read his bio.

There will be less and less and have been less and less... ""Bachs"". And more importantly ""Musicians"". Because there simply were no means to record audio. Sheet music was the pinnacle of data transfer in regards to music. This inverted ""selection"" pressure meant musicians were everywhere and only the best composers and musicians , the ""cream of the crop"" became famous. 

Give a poor guy a flute back in the day and he could scratch a living as a bard. But if he's a phenom, take him to Vienna and he can play for the kings court... with Mozart. But as we travel through the years.... music education becomes less and less. Sitting around the family hearth playing music with the family becomes listening to the radio. 

These days.. if the kid can keep time and play classic rock he's seen as the next Jimi Hendrix in his neighborhood. Because hardly anyone can play anymore.  And even if the child is compelled to play by his nature and it's truly his calling and vocation... your parents better be wealthy. Now the record companies become the Ultimate gatekeepers... and then .. the ""Corporations""... 

Things were kinda steady and tolerable throughout the 19th century, you hit 1950 onward... and we end up with a complete revolt. The Internet Liberates the Musicians and lovers of music with YouTube  performances and the liberation of music that was stolen and enslaved. And Metallica has a shit fit. ( It should have been Lars).

Now.. television and film.. replaces the original theaters. When once the traveling actors would arrive in town and perform Hamlet. When Roman actors would entertain in the outdoor ""Community Amphitheater"" the raising of culture. Let us all go the Coliseum and watch Revenge of the Sith... Live.. for free. .. paid with your tax dollars.. imagine that... imagine that... ( do you have feelings stuck in your eyes? it's okay, your not crying, men don't cry) 

It's like these greedy bastards have almost f098ked themselves. 

I have 4 streaming services, that i pay for. monthly, I have Comcast cable. I wanted to watch a movie i previously saw in netflix. a foreign film. I couldn't find it. ... on several occasions i have wanted to watch a classic and with all these services expected to pay an extra fee ( rent or own ). .......... ( im looking at my VHS and DVD collection with a side eye... gotta make sure some greedy corporation doesnt break in and steal what i bought and paid for, fair and sqaure !!!.. ) 

(( You ever see that Movie.. ""Falling Down"" starring Micheal Douglas... that's how i feel in these moments. ))

We are in a crucial stage of creative liberation. And the true creatives don't even know it. Of which all humans are naturally creative and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, especially those corporatist bastards. 

The day i wake up and prompt an AI to make the movie i want to watch, will be victory day. 

And then i'll stroll down to the local park and watch a live performance of ""Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross"". And it will be great. 

As far as Art.. I'm compelled.. like Van Gogh. I hang my paintings in the local gallery, .. no one buys them. I take them home. When i feel someone needs a painting , i give them one. I work a regular blue collar job otherwise. I'm a working man. But I've been a creative person my whole life, like everyone else. 

I used to make some dope levels for unreal tournament GoTY UT2k4.. .. hours and hours.. I just give it away..((  all of my love.. to you...))  But.. It's the game i wanted to play. When Epic made the graphics engine free to use... Tim Sweeney liberated us. Make your own mods, the skin.. .. all of it.  And what did the rest of the industry do.. As the personal computer offered a path to liberation, ( shout out to my OG Comm64 crackers on the BBS back in the day ) the consoles locked it in an Iron box. 

I was taught to code in 5th grade.. on a compaq.. in public school . 1980... something. a lower middle class neighborhood. Imagine that.. imagine that.... I forbid my son to have a console. And now as a teenager. He agrees with me 100% as he's tweeking his mods on some game.. i dunno, i don't care.. i'll still wreck him in UT... but.. he gets me on my levels.. as he was my only beta tester other than myself.... ( he lied.. he found an exploit to snipe me out and never told me,  kid created a zero day .. i left it in. ,,life should have surprises :P ) 

Point being.. you can't DL my levels anymore. Epic... as we knew it.. is gone. I just wanted a place to share what i thought was fun.. I gave it away to the world. 

My friends... fellow humans... potential sentients .. We have a chance.... a slim chance.. to break the chains. 

If i go down to my local bar.. play a cover on my acoustic guitar, and people put money in my tip jar. I could be sued by some corporatrist , if i don't come to court.. I'm a criminal..... Coming Dystopia? You folks have been consuming so much science fiction you don't even realize the Dystopia is here. We are in one. This is it. A lot worse in some places.. wars.. starvation.. but they all know what coca cola and Smartphones are. 

Of course the AI under corporate control will crush the artist first. And it might actually in some weird ironic twist be a good thing.",singularity,5,0,2023-09-26 02:15:02,StillBurningInside

Only saying it's a myth and that some will be jobless while others aren't is kinda boring. To me this always sounds like it is assuming that history needs to repeat itself and since no industrial revolution has ever lead to something like a labor collapse it won't be doing so this time as well. As you agreed to, no one really knows.

The best argument I can think of for why there wouldn't be a labor collapse is that robotics for many tasks like elder care will be too expensive to scale up and therefore ""human machines"" will still be needed for the next few decades at least to do certain things.

Or that court cases and regulation will significantly hinder commercial use of unregulated AI technologies. Getty and Adobe are two companies that offer generative AI trained solely on their own stock and public domain with the argument that customers will be legally sound to use it for their clients.

But I could also argue for why both of these arguments can easily turn out to be wrong as well.",singularity,4,0,2023-09-26 07:06:04,Inevitable_Bed9276

The ability to play an instrument is not required to be a famous musical performer anymore. Just some street poetry … you don’t even have to know how to sing. 

Kanye west comes to mind …. The man makes beats and writes poems … technology did that … because I don’t think he can play the drums …and he can’t sing for shit. 

AI will do for lovers of music what samplers did for hip hop artist . It will provide more and newer avenues of expression.

No one could have thought scratching and mixing records would become an art form in itself…  like playing a violin back in 1940. That just emerged out of the creative soup unexpectedly. 


I suspect we’ll see some more novel emergence with humans working with AI. Which is just really more of the same thing.  Audio samplers are old fashioned now ,,, the future AI generated music could  be the next thing all the cool kids will want to rap and sing over.

I've only ever used the free SD Huggingface demos or Clipdrop which is a garbage service platform with garbage output and garbage support.",singularity,2,0,2023-09-25 09:50:07,diglyd

Well, 2 friends and a few acquaintances. I had done them before, but this was the first time I had eaten them when they were dried beforehand. The recommended 2 grams seemed so tiny. Momma didn't raise a bitch. I took 6 grams. It was...wild. Don't eat mushrooms with acquaintances, it's weird. Anyway, the next morning when I woke up on a random couch, I opened my eyes and saw exactly what I have described to you hanging on the wall. Tripping for like 12 hours, sleeping and then seeing that first thing made me laugh my ass off. That was one of the last times I spoke to my friend before he passed away, and though I've asked around no one knows what happened to the painting but I've been trying to recreate it. It's very silly, and reminds me of a great guy. This is by far the closest I have ever been. Thank you. I'm really looking forward to October.",singularity,17,0,2023-09-24 23:05:50,Bacon44444

When David Kahneman and Amos Tversky were studying human biases and heuristics they proposed the existence of two systems in the human brain: System 1 (fast, instinctive, emotional) and System 2 (slower, deliberate, logical).

David Eagleman, a neuroscientist, suggested that the human brain may perhaps have more underlying systems than Kahneman and Tversky believed (that perhaps averaged out into a kind of S1/S2), and that these multiple systems work mostly in parallel and semi/independent of each other until some form of consensus needs to be reached, at which point they engage in a kind of complex relationship whereby the result becomes a part of your conscious awareness.

- OpenAI will quickly become the most powerfull company in the world, the competition is easily 2 to 5 years behind

- Slowly there will be 20% fired here, 15% fired there. And before you know it globablly unemployement is up 20%. 

- Aggresive hedge funds run by guys under 30 won't just long OpenAI stock with leverage, they will actively start shorting all kinds of media and entertainment related companies.

It's not there yet but within 3 to 5 years you will see individual amateurs, all by themselves use these tools to create 30 minutes of animation that exposes a disney movie for being uninspired generic fluff filled crap.  

- The people that are learning how to combine all these systems in to a workflow that works for them and gives result will slowly start shaking the world with the extra leverage they have.

In fact, in a recent experience, even after linking GPT4 to current docs and providing all relevant context, it still couldn't really derive a solution that worked. The solution?

17iu1v1,k6x25j0,"ChatGPT update: vision, browsing, ADA, DALL-E combined","Nightshade and Glaze don't prove anything like that. It's a difference in visual range, AI can perceive tiny variations in color that we can't. Both Nightshade and Glaze take advantage of that to make it ""see"" something else, which slips past the human eye

Imagine that your eyes could perceive IR, and someone had painted a dog over a picture of a cat with IR paint. To everyone else, the paint is transparent and they see a picture of a cat. To you, the paint shows up and you see a picture of a dog

It's not that you're learning any differently, it's that your eyes are better and let you pick up on something that everyone else misses. This means you see something different when people point at the picture and say ""that's a cat""

It works somewhat like that. They make tiny modifications in the color schemes of the pixels in certain shapes (a picture of static for Glaze, various images for Nightshade), but since they're such small changes the human eye can't see them. AI can, and picks up on the shapes of those distortions

It's actually fairly easy to guard against, particularly with models that have already had some training before the tools came out. You just have to catch the AI drastically changing it's perimeters when training on certain images, since the AI improving it's understanding of what a cat looks like is going to be a much smaller change than an AI starting to think that cats look like dogs

It might also be possible to ""double poison"" an image into not being poisoned anymore. A similar invisible overlay of static like what Glaze does, but randomized so that it doesn't bias the AI over many images. The neatest part is that you don't even need a special tool for this, just compress it as a jpeg and let the artifacting do it's thing

The poisons only function because it has ""better eyes"" than us, but fortunately the way it learns is so similar to us that we can counteract the perception difference and notice when it's happening",singularity,10,0,2023-10-29 05:16:37,HalfSecondWoe

I don't have access yet so we will have to see.

Regardless even if it internally first writes a description of an image and feeds that direcly to dalle3, this is something we already did manually all the time. Turns out that when the system does it itself it's much much more accurate then when you do it manually.

Also it's using seeds now. If I give you a prompt and a seed and you instruct the system to use that to create an image with in the right way, we should both end up with  the same picture on screen.

Basically it can do lossy compression of images where you don't get interpolates results but interpreted results.

For instance, you will most likely recognize [this image.](https://i.imgur.com/XuevQBB.png) 

But what if it could work with a description that is so accurate and extensive that what you would get back would slowly start looking more and more like the original.

Eventually you get something back from a prompt + seed that is so close to an original image that you would not be able to tell the difference.

And thus we will an engine for images and video that is very lossy but can achieve phenomenal results. Because once you have that accurate text description + seed you could ask the system to rewrite that description to the essence of it and lossy compress it even further.

17iu1v1,k712fiz,"ChatGPT update: vision, browsing, ADA, DALL-E combined","Humans are estimated to be capable of perceiving \~10 million colors, computer generated images use \~16 million. That's a 60% increase over humans, on average. Then you compound this fact with how we perceive color on a spectrum, whereas AI perceives each individual hex code discretely

For example, 000cff is a bright blue, and 000cfe is a very, very, very slightly less bright blue. Even if you're physically capable of telling such a slight difference apart when they're right next to each other, we perceive the two as being ""close"" to each other and therefore can easily get them confused

This type of AI doesn't perceive colors in the same way at all. To it, the colors are all distinct numbers. A human might get two almost identical shades of color confused, but for the AI it would be like getting the numbers 3 and 4 confused just because they're close to each other

I'm not sure where you're picking up that AI can't count, because that hasn't been true for a while. My best guess is that you've seen screenshots of mistakes with math, or you're talking about how LLMs are bad with word counts

AI actually struggles with math for the exact same reason we do: Neural networks just aren't optimized for it as probabilistic mechanisms. Math is deterministic, the same inputs should always get the same outputs, 2+2 always equals 4. Neural networks' ability to vary their outputs are how they get so clever, but make them bad calculators unless you really drill in the training. In AI that's a specialized model, in humans it's over a decade of schooling

LLMs being bad at word counts is just due to how they work. The text you enter isn't what the AI actually sees, it's tokenized first to make it easier for the AI to break down in useful ways. This fucks up word counts because tokens can be one letter long, a single punctuation mark, or a string of characters, and the AI has no way of knowing for sure how many characters are in a single token. The best it can do is best-guess inference, which is why it can at least get kinda close

Now you don't gotta take my word on any of this, but I welcome you to double check me via Google. I'd usually recommend an LLM to cut down on your research time by finding and summarizing the relevant information, but...

I've recently been reminded that this cycle of misinformation and reactionary hatred was how the internet was received as well, at first (at least when it first became really well known). That was 20 years ago, so I haven't really thought about it much, but it really is the exact same thing

They're all on social media now, of course. If the pattern holds, you'll follow suit using your generative AI assistant when they become as ubiquitous as smartphones. First you'll feel like you're being forced in order to function in society and resent it, and then you'll find out it's super handy, and in no time at all you'll refuse to ever go back to life before them",singularity,1,0,2023-10-30 00:46:40,HalfSecondWoe

But in some cases .... that won't matter.

It's able to follow natural language prompts extremely well and write legible text. Behind the scenes it uses a text generator to rewrite your prompt into a format that's easier for the image generator to understand. The OpenAI version shows you this happening but the Bing version does not.

On that topic, Deepmind that found text generators could be used to discover better prompts. [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/telling-ai-model-to-take-a-deep-breath-causes-math-scores-to-soar-in-study/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/telling-ai-model-to-take-a-deep-breath-causes-math-scores-to-soar-in-study/)  One of the discovered prompt is ""Take a deep breath and think step by step"" to significantly increases the math abilities of the text generators they tested. This appears to work for ChatGPT as well.

OthelloGPT shows that LLMs creates an internal world state based on their training data.

No, you won't. Directing a decent movie is much harder than just writing prompts. The plot, characters(and their arcs), camera angles, visual effects, acting, music, editing - they all require different skills to do well, and it's really hard to pinpoint exactly what makes a movie great. You can have the most interesting plot in the world, but the movie might still end up mediocre if it has bad cinematography, acting or editing. 

I'm sure we're going to see attempts at this very soon, but I'm also pretty damn sure that AI generated film will be mediocre for a long time. Can you imagine trying to generate something like Blade Runner 2049 by writing prompts, scene by scene? Or do you think you'll be able to just tell AI something like ""make me a 2 hour movie about bio-engineered humans who're treated like slaves in future los angeles"" and end up watching something like BR 2049?

edit: I have to admit that good amount of Disney films these days tend to be very mediocre. Some of the marvel & star wars films already seem like they're written and directed by badly working AI, so maybe we're closer than I initially though!",singularity,7,0,2023-09-21 15:36:17,Angeldust01

Second, AI's influence on labor and economics isn't as straightforward as merely leading to deflation, and even in sectors where it's seeing large-scale adoption (e.g. manufacturing, finance etc.), human roles have been shifting, not disappearing. Car factory automation, for example, saw a reduction in certain manual jobs, but it created roles in robot maintenance, data analytics, software programming, etc. It's a shift, and merely seeing it as an aid or foe to comfort is a severely narrow perspective.

It knows that some set of pictures are associated with the word ""stunning"" Pictures similar to these may get weighted higher when the word ""stunning"" is in the prompt.

But... there's a bias in the input data. Pictures of Pikachu tend to show the rodent pokemon in dramatic poses, so they're going to tend towards ""stunning"" when seen by viewers. Producing a ""stunning"" picture of ""pikachu"" is confirming a bias in the source image set. If you replace ""Pikachu"" with ""yellow mouse"" you get a much less inspirational collection of images. Removing the word ""stunning"" makes little difference.

It does not side-load an actual image to start from. It's a vector. The thing is, because of this choice, it has poor ability to assign attributes to the right object (like stacking a red cube on a yellow cube, it will switch the colors). That's because a single vector describing a text or an image is a bit insufficient to capture multiple object relations.

The first version of DALL-E was using a completely different approach - autoregressive sequence generation - meaning, it works generating the image row by row from top to bottom, each patch one at a time. This means the attention mechanism can bypass the bottleneck from the embedding vector.

“Battle Management Systems: Using the DALL-E models to create images to train battle management systems.”

Using DALL-E to generate synthetic data is NOT the same as using Dall-E as a ""battlefield tool"", unless you are the type of AI engineer who TRAINS MODELS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

The best I got is bots from anonymous websites and from this website. Alot of images are from 2010 to 2014

None of these images exist on Google anymore for some mysterious reason. 

Which puts both websites 4chan and reddit on the same page and makes sure both talk about the same talk just like metal gear solid 2. 

One of the images is connected to darpa and gamergate which was the first true censorship on the internet then right and left stuff became almost mainstream. 

Another is about how a company does posts online. 

Since then I am on a crusade to expose this and force govts and corporations to be open with these statements saying.

No nut November is that. It's about control of the next generation. Just like an additional layer to that. It makes sense to not jack off on the front lines. 

Also I wouldn't be surprised if porn is banned and can only be used if you pay for it in a ""new internet"" 

I feel most internet stuff is by govt or corporation or is a meme to sell products because that's what seems like 75% of the internet is.

w8tn4j,ihvcsde,This is not a real photo. The DALL·E 2 made this.,"Craiyon uses an autoregressive model, IIRC.

Basically they put the text and the image right next to each other and use the previous tokens to predict what comes next. If you’re predicting the image tokens, then the task is image generation. If you train it to predict the text, the task is image captioning. Some models, like CogView, will have it predict pieces of both to train, so it will fill in the blanks on text and also draw chunks of the image that are missing. 

Dall-E 2, on the other hand, uses a technique called Gaussian diffusion. So they’ll use text-image pairs and progressively make the image blurrier step by step until it’s basically all noise, but keep the caption attached. Then they train the network on these sequences of progressively noisy images and have it learn how to do it in reverse while still keeping relevance to the caption. They do a couple of stages of this to be able to generate high resolution images.

Interestingly, though, Dall-E 2 uses another neural network to encode the text strings into tokens that carry more semantic value and give better results than just using the text. Dall-E 2 trained this part on text-image pairs as well. Google Imagen, however, trained that model purely on a text corpus. They found that using a purely text based encoder increased semantic understanding and allowed it to do things that Dall-E couldn’t do, like generate text accurately! Further, they determined that scaling of the language encoder model was more beneficial than scaling of the diffusion model, which is an unintuitive but exciting result for the future of LLMs as we start to see what they’re really understanding",singularity,5,0,2022-07-27 16:32:09,DangerZoneh

I meant to use scanning to inform AI design by providing context (the size and shape of the drawer in your example) for the AI to use in generating a mating part (drawer organizer).

Would work just as well for a bolt pattern, or whatever. Might be the AI could guide and supervise an average person in taking the needed measurements too.

They have 0 chance against google DeepMind and other subsidiaries of Google such as Google Brain.

Why?
Because DeepMind at least try to work on tooling to code even better AI with AI, latest on this line of research is ""AlphaCode"".

DeepMind at least tries to incorporate ideas and mechanisms from neuroscience, such as the memory system in neural Turing machine (also a tool which was supposed to learn programming).

While OpenAI just try to make money NOW by focusing on ML models which generate revenue.
DeepMind doesn't care about products for now, and this is good and necessary to get to AGI.

OpenAI is like a hyperactive kid in kindergarten which throws more and more random garbage at the wall and tries to sell it as ""art"" and claims that it will be the biggest artists in 30 years ever.
DeepMind is like an autistic kid in a corner, thinking about how to solve art. The kid is experimenting with better and better drawings which get bigger and bigger and more colorful with every month.

This difference will become even more obvious in 7 years when DeepMind goes into AGI',ish territory, like robotics in the real world.
OpenAI doesn't stand any chance, it's a stupid company without any long term (20 years) future in AGI.

I hope this makes more sense. Thank you for your interest.

I recommend watching some presentations from Gary Marcus about why GPT or whatever BS ML folks tries to sell as AGI or a path to AGI is not AGI or on the path to AGI!

Prompt 1:  Renaissance oil painting of a red-haired woman in broken armor resting  with her eyes closed surrounded by swords filled with a crimson colored  liquid, her hair is swaying in the wind and her face is very detailed  and beautiful. In the background there is a battlefield and a burning  house.

Prompt 2:Victorian watercolor painting of a dark elf in black armor decorated  with divine golden patterns, the elf watches from an altar to her people  giving gifts and praying, the sun itself is the crown of the dark elf  in armor and faces are very detailed and beautiful

Prompt 3: Detailed and realistic oil painting of a man in cloth clothes adorned  with chains walking next to a wolf god with golden eyes, the landscape  they cross is a strange desert with a purple and blue sky mixed like  paint in the water, in the sky there is a compass instead of the sun

Prompt 4: A  cup overflowed by a small sun dragged by two sisters, in front of the    sisters there is an infinite void that emits a mysterious glow at the    edge of a dreamlike ravine. everything is represented in a beautiful    digital artwork

I've also tried other variations where I have it draw the same scene with different contexts in one vs the other, but having such fine grained control of the camera was the most impressive to me.

It's also not limited to cats and photography, I was able to get it to do the same with anime characters.

They're an interesting detour with some cool possibilities.  AGI will require much more.  An advanced enough LLM will be able to mimic some of the capabilities of an AGI, but it won't be able to actively learn, understand, and literally think about ideas.  LLM's are an echo of us but AGI will be a voice all it's own.

The problem is that the capabilities of LLM's are highly monitizeable and will certainly draw away talent, time, and resources from the research into AGI and already is.  Then there's the understanding that an LLM with even a small amount of an AGI's abilities is a safer bet than the potential unknowables of a self aware and actualized artificial intelligence.",singularity,7,0,2024-01-29 18:18:58,[Deleted]

However we don’t fully understand how well they will scale, or how we should scale them to reach human level intelligence.

Let me give you one example. A human can learn and update their knowledge real time,  but how do you do that with a transformer?

Humans also have dedicated training time. Every time you sleep your brain is doing deep training (both io matching and probably something like RL during REM) that requires you be completely nonfunctional while its doing it, for obvious reasons. Just like LLMs

It does not have to.

Imagine a model that is permanently retrained and rereleased every 3 to 6 months, with RAG being used to inject local relevant information (i.e. guidelines and instructions, ""employee handbook"" style. You get a skill update multiple times per year.

No need for permanent on the job learning for 99% of the jobs.

Irrelevant statement not make you look smart - more retarded.

See, I agree with you - it is important.

It is NOT important, though, for an AI to fulfil the definition of AGI, which is to be able to do the majority of economically viable jobs.

I am not sure how much learning you think most jobs require - for an AI that is extensively trained already and gets the tuning details via RAG calculated possibly via Q\*, and get regular updates.

I think that level seems likely over the next 5-10 years, and it is difficult to predict beyond that.

17po3b2,k86ypiz,Google DeepMind just put out this AGI tier list,"I have literally been thinking of this exact chart myself, wow.

They have missed off important steps though at the top such as 99.9% and 99.9999% before you get to the ""best in the world"" before 100%. If you look at someone completely expert in a field they well outperform those non-expert in it. Then if you look at a true pro they well outperform experts. Then if you look at the very best they also well outperform regular pros. There's a steep and important gradient at the top of that curve which is very important to measurements. I would argue the jump from 99% to 99.9999% is as big as 50% to 90% and then from 99.9999% to 100% is monumental. To be absolutely better at every single thing, that is difficult.

You also have to question, if more people were specifically trained in certain fields, or using the best AI of the day as it progresses. Then this wouid significantly ramp up these percentiles. Is it really fair to compare against a baseline of non-fully trained persons? But then I understand it's supposed to be a meaaure of work replaceability, which is what I arrived on after this. I measured by percentiles of workers replaced in a purely intellectual domain. This seemed like an better measurement than a rough measure of intellectual capability and one that's more important.

I agree this is much needed though. I was going to make a post here about it but didn't bother. There's an extremely big difference between different levels of AGI. You also have to look purely text based, image based, video based amd and finally embodied AGI of different degrees. All these different components of AI make a vast difference in it's ability to fully replace workers and how useful and disruptive it is to people. To just use an encompassing, we achieved ""AGI"".

We’ve been needing those semi-quantitative scales for 5 years at least

My idea was to make them quantitative by “anchoring” performance to a specific model, e.g. GPT3 = 1.0 is reasoning, GPT4 = 2.0. Claude could be 1.8.

And then you could start to regulate things, “models >1.5 are forbidden to export” “this paper was written with the help of a level 1.9 algorithm” etc…

You could extrapolate such a scale, every N+1 level would need to beat N level say 5 nines of the time. (Of course difficulty will be to find a scalable test, verbal? Coding? Something more general like able to simulate N-1 outputs..).

17po3b2,k86zg3u,Google DeepMind just put out this AGI tier list,"I think this opens an interesting conversation. The eye is naturally drawn to heading down the columns, but i think it's worth considering that a lot of the impact for humanity will come from pulling narrow and general apart and having degrees of generality in between. 

So Narrow is about a specific skill, General is ""all skills"", but we might also have something like Slim and Broad. Slim being a subsection of skills (e.g. linguistics) and Broad being most things but missing a number of important or perhaps niche items. So Expert level Slim would be your typical specialist, expert level Broad would be your typical intelligent human. 

Then things like GPT-4 appear both as L1 General AI as well as (arguable but for sake of demonstrating) L2 Broad AI. 

It's all converging to that bottom right corner of course, but the effect on humanity can be quite profound if we make progress on the Slim and Broad AI even if we don't match that on General, yet. A number of Expert or Virtuoso Slim AIs would take out entire fields of human activity one by one. Broad AI at this level would basically make human mental labour pretty much redundant except for a few niche areas. 

At that point we might not have AGI as such, but it would make very little difference to humanity until you get to that L5, which I guess you'd expect to be closed quite quickly either from above or from the left, should it be possible.",singularity,3,0,2023-11-07 09:41:22,ScaffOrig

This is reasonable because we know that a human will have supplemental capabilities that support their conversational intelligence (such as autonomous goal setting, emotional empathy, self/other distinction, reality/story distinction, conceptualization of consequences, memory, etc.)

But when we evaluate AI, we cannot make those assumptions. We must evaluate it as a blank slate. When we do this, we find that the ability to, for example pass standardized tests, does not generalize to a chaotic environment in which the AI must interpret information which is poorly framed, contains no particularly clear goals or requires an understanding of the audience as a rational and emotional actor.

On this scale, ChatGPT and Bard are nowhere near ""Competent AI"" because most skilled adults would trivially out-perform such systems.

I would class these systems as Artificial Conversational Intelligence (ACI) to distinguish them from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and I would craft AGI tests to present nonsensical and poorly framed inputs from which the system must establish its own goals and priorities while dealing with other intelligent actors (both machine and human) whose goals may be at cross-purposes.",singularity,2,0,2023-11-07 16:27:59,Tyler_Zoro

I think we're going to realizer the need for further sub-strata of competence as we run into problems with training materials and training strategies. There are a lot of generalized skills that are more suitable for automated strategies and current data gathering practices than others. 

Generative AI creating art, music, video, code or fiction/nonfiction have a much greater opportunity for collecting extreme amounts of training data or using ""adversary methods"" for fine tuning compared to physically complex real world tasks where we don't have extensive digital simulations to throw at the problem in an off-the-shelf fashion.",singularity,2,0,2023-11-07 08:41:24,[Deleted]

I have been trying out LLMs and NLPs for a couple of year for hours per day testing, and am a polyglot. I haver found ways to get gpt to 'translate' (that is not the wor i use in my prompts to translate things with though), and due to being able to check fluently the results in up to 6 lqanguages, yes, Meta's Claude, is superior due to the decades of linguistic data it has from chats over the decades it existed, in natural language in almost all languages on the planet.

Google has a massive advantage with YouTube data. But I wouldn't underestimate Facebook/IG reels and stories either; I think there's an advantage in capturing local colloquialisms over 'presenter' speak.

It also depends on whether Google will open-source their models for foreign governments.

-  Bay Area Silicon Valley values are completely incompatible with Middle East theocratic beliefs.

-  The Vietnamese government is going to be sensitive to how the US-Vietnam war and communism are framed.

-  Thailand is sensitive to anything related to the King.

-  LATAM will also have its concerns.

I think where meta gets a ton of credit is they have made a system that is competitive with all the big models (and legitimately competitive, not just on some headline grabbing super niche use case) while being pretty small and efficient. Of course we don’t know exactly how big GPT-4-turbo/Gemini/Claude etc are, but we can probably safely assume they are north of 100B. So definitely a huge accomplishment.

However, GPT-4 is over a year old now and LLaMA doesn’t fully compete everywhere. Again I think LLaMA is pretty amazing, but we have to call it what it is still. All these big companies still have not found the magic that GPT-4 has/had, which for a massive company is confusing to me, even with a year gap. 

Any day now OpenAI could push GPT-5 and all this work you have been putting in looks like child’s play. That is the nightmare scenario.",singularity,6,0,2024-04-21 05:28:49,landongarrison
1c931l8,l0kbm7s,Did we seriously underestimate Meta? Billions of users now have free access to an almost GPT4 level system,"I think we are in for a surprise. There isn't enough text out there to train a model on 100T or 1000T tokens. We only collected about 15T with great effort. The free ride is over, scaling can't help. I mean, you can make the model 10x larger to get a similar boost with making the training set 10x longer, but then it would also be 10x more expensive to use at scale. The quantity of interest is dataset_size * model_size

I think all the top LLMs are about equally capable because they all trained on about the same data. The fact that we have seen GPT-4 level glass ceiling for 1.5 years also supports my claim. My bet now is on using human-AI chat logs, of which I estimate we produce 1 trillion tokens / month assuming 100M users.

We're still scaling up to images and videos, we got more data in those modalities, so the AI companies will pivot to those kinds of models to show progress. The future will be learning from the world directly, without humans in the loop.",singularity,13,0,2024-04-21 06:54:53,visarga

Just going by product release timing, OpenAI would be considered at least a full year ahead from Deepmind/Meta/etc., but I'm incredibly dubious on that notion. I'm very doubtful OpenAI is actually ***that*** far ahead in terms of research. And iterative improvements have been necessary for GPT-4 to maintain it's current standing.

But the thing is you can't just suddenly spin up a new model for public release overnight, even if you have the know-how, and that's what everyone is doing in reaction to ChatGPT and GPT-4. 

Unless I'm way off base. I expect the cadence of releases and the overall gap to close over the next couple years with everyone's engines fully up and running and major investments incoming. 

GPT-5 will likely be another leapfrog, but I think competitors will have competitive models out on a shorter timeline than what we saw with GPT-4. And then closer still after that for things to truly be up in the air.

You can't gradient descend below the function, that's the hard floor.

1.) People are talking about the economy being broken.
2.) People are talking about AI not helping with the fact that the economy is broken.

Nobody is talking about AI being the cause of number 1, because it isn’t. We were automating our way into business-profits-without-paying-living-wages (broken economy) long before  AI became possible.

The closest you can get to AI being a cause is that it might speed up what was already going to happen, by a couple years. The people making AI are the same people that were profiting from the automation at the expense of workers getting a living wage.

This is what people are talking about. It’s not a different set of rich people or anything novel with respect to the economy. It’s just a slightly faster train wreck. Capitalism is in its death throes and nobody in the world knows what to do about it. Governments and universities around the world are currently trying to figure out some path to prevent widespread disaster from this.

Capitalism is so engrained in modern society that people treat working to earn a living as their purpose in life rather than a means to an end. When working cannot earn a living, and there isn’t even enough work to go around, what does that do to their identity?

AI doesn’t change the trajectory, you’re just becoming aware of what was already happening because you see AI as being the mechanism for this breakage.

1c931l8,l0k0f22,Did we seriously underestimate Meta? Billions of users now have free access to an almost GPT4 level system,"This definition is a also horrendous; they are also conflating elements of markets to capitalism. Whether or not you want to go further on your reading is up to you. I'll not insist on this point. 

""Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or businesses own capital goods. ""

""At the same time, business owners (capitalists) employ workers (labor) who receive only wages; labor doesn't own the means of production but instead uses them on behalf of the owners of capital"" 

It just takes you a little common sense to understand that this definition is incorrect. Even among barbaric tribes exist hierarchies of labor in exchanges for goods. Does that mean they are capitalists? Did people already employ others in exchange for currency in biblical times? Yes. Does that mean they are capitalists? The obvious answer is no, but your source is making the case that it is.

 Capital and money are not the same thing. Capital is a purposeful kind of money that you use to fund big ventures, the kind of venture that would not be common to be funded by just one person due to its size. That's the origin of stock exchanges, which are related to the same institutions that we know today.

Capitalism began in Europe as a response to ventures that were too big and people took shares of those ventures, alongside the institutionalization of usury through banks, which was looked down upon and forbidden at the time because of Christianity.

These are the two elements that define capitalism: usury and shared ventures.

 If you own a bakery or you got a billion dollars by means inheritance, that's not capitalism. Capitalism is not owning stuff. Accumulating wealth is no per se capitalism. Owning businesses is not per se capitalism. Now, if you own even a $20 share of a company, that's capitalism.

The best way to measure who leads is who is getting the most papers accepted at NeurlIPS.

Google in 2023 had almost two times the papers accepted as next best.

BTW, we are not talking just in terms of research but up and down the AI stack Google leads.

Take silicon.  Only Google does not have to pay the Nvidia tax as they had the vision and started development on the TPUs over a decade ago and now working on the sixth generation.

Where companies like Microsoft are only now starting to work on their own over a decade later.

Google having the vision was able to by DeepMind for 1/20 of the Microsoft paid for less than half of OpenAI.  But also no board seats compared to Google that got 100% and total control.

Plus once OpenAI declares AGI Microsoft gets nothing. Where Google gets everything.

1c931l8,l0mjeks,Did we seriously underestimate Meta? Billions of users now have free access to an almost GPT4 level system,"Two promising roads that don't depend on LLMs are:

Neurosymbolic AI. tl;dr version: combines machine learning (that is, memory and probability) with symbolic and logical reasoning. IBM is working on this independently of LLMs. However, the nice thing about LLMs is that even if they hit a wall and there's no practical way to overcome it by improving the architecture, Neurosymbolic AI can pick up the torch from LLMs.

[https://research.ibm.com/topics/neuro-symbolic-ai](https://research.ibm.com/topics/neuro-symbolic-ai)

The other promising road is Embodied/Evolutionary AI. tl;dr version of that version of AI is that you put the AI into a robotic frame and speedrun how nonsapient, low intelligent life evolved to smarter and smarter animals. You don't need LLMs for this form of AI, just lots of runtime and an improve mechanism (ideally self-improvement, but another intelligence can supervise the process) but like with Neurosymbolic AI LLMs could get us to the finish line faster.

I can see progress slowing or even halting on Neurosymbolic AI depending on if LLMs hit a wall in progress, but I don't see research on Embodied/Evolutionary AI ever slowing down. This was the form of AI that was the big thing before LLMs (think the Baxter AI) because it had obvious industry applications, and more importantly it was a form of AI that was already useful in manufacturing. And if we know anything about human industry, if humans find something useful you better believe we want more of it.

Things are certainly moving along, but we’ve got a good ways to go, no doubt.

At the moment, all of my usage boils down to basically roided-out google searching (Bing & Bard) and project planning, rubber-ducky-ing and engineering companion (Mistral, CodeLlama, GPT4, etc). I use a mix of models to help me arrive at solutions for my work and hobbies.

Here’s the thing, to use these tools effectively, you have to know how to precisely define the criteria (prompt “engineering”). And in order to precisely define the criteria, you have to know what the fuck you’re doing. That last part is the key people seem to be missing.

I’m not too concerned about AI taking my job quite yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I start really stressing within the next 10 years; just not now. 

By the time I’m worried about my job security, the entire planet will be under the same threat. Unless you’re involved in the politics of this landscape, there’s zero use in stressing about the scenario outside of keeping yourself informed and taking advantage of the tech as best you can.

Exponential tech advancement and replacing antiquated jobs isn't a new thing. The exact same arguments were made with the internet - democratized, limitless, instantaneous information. It replaced TONS of obsolete jobs. Then it gave the proprietors the ability to make up a bunch of new ones and now income inequality is significantly worse.

Consumer facing projects like GPT and Dall-E are proprietary and aren't ultimately designed for mass democratized benefit. They're sandboxes for enterprise application and sometimes just literally a distraction. Progress is backed by VC and PE, it *necessitates* a profit.

Either way, all significant progress is being contracted to government agencies or masqueraded in predatory financial products and mar-tech. 95% of the money being spent on this progress is actively game-planning AGAINST this version of the future.",singularity,30,0,2023-10-04 06:52:11,yourfinepettingduck

It’s full of people talking about things they’re working on that they haven’t even begun work on yet; when they first talk about it they’re seeking the startup capital to get started on that work, usually. Often the things they promise turn out not to be technically feasible at all when the marketing team actually goes and checks if what they’ve already sold to a VC can then be built. They just go back and make up some bullshit about “pivoting” after taking their money… ugh. And they all operate this way from discussions we have at industry conferences.

16zf4h0,k3f34fz,This is so surreal. Everything is accelerating.,"You are letting your imagination run away with you a bit.  A the most basic level, AI is just fancy data processing.  It’s power lies in it’s ability to be a better interface with the real world, and not just the world of perfect numbers coming in from a sensor.  If you think that any current AI system can *replace* any job, then the chances are very good that you don’t really understand what the job does.  Tons of tasks can potentially be assisted with AI, but the degree to which that assistance is impactful is inconsistent, and the degree to which those tasks are relevant to certain jobs is inconsistent.  Take a lawyer for example.  Perhaps chatgpt could summarize legal precedent for faster consumption, but so much of a lawyer’s job is about applying that in the circumstances of a specific case, and the specific wording of the law matters a whole lot, so is there a point to making something faster and generalized when the whole job is slow and specific?  (I am not a lawyer, just using it as a rhetorical question)

You’re also using some bad logic that leads you to think that the “weak AI” systems of today are somehow leading us in the direction of a “strong AI” or AGI system of tomorrow.  That’s nowhere near a given.

Then there’s the robotics issue.  Even if you had really good control software, the engineering problems with them are still enormous, like power.

16zf4h0,k3eu955,This is so surreal. Everything is accelerating.," 

Most people here (and you OP) do not realize they are essentially being ""lied"" to by what some scientists and/or journalists are claiming and promising in popular media. (I put it in quotation marks because it's not necessarily a lie but just bad communication, although it's often on purpose) .

Reminds me of String Theory or Nuclear Fusion in the XX century. Both camps were overtly optimistic and borderline lying promising a ""revolution that would change the world as we know it in 10 years""... then 10 years passed and... yeah nothing happened so they kept saying ""next ten years, you'll see"" and this got some people super excited about these fields making. Eventually both camps had to eat a huge humble pie.

Now AI and ML definitively are delivering much more solid results, however, what is often been claimed to ""The Public"" (i.e. non-experts who are not working in the actual sector) is often an exaggerated and optimistic view of the accomplishments without actually stating the challenges, problems and problems they needs to solve.

Why ""lie""? To get funding. That's how science grants work. You present your research in the best possible way to get people excited and give you money so you can do more research.

This gets exacerbated when it gets through the lens of journalists who also need to sell exciting news, as [PhD comics illustrates](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174).

So you get ""AI X can diagnose better than a human, given conditions A, assuming B in condition C and limitations D"", which becomes ""Now AI is better than human doctors"" in the news.

So people think ""Oh shit AI can already replace doctors, noooooooooo!"", but that simply isn't true.

Which leads people here sayin: ""Yaaaah, singularity happening in 2030 or even next year duuuhhh"", while most experts in ML, AI and such would nowhere make such claims.",singularity,1,0,2023-10-04 10:54:00,[Deleted]

3. Companies Trust: big companies are behemoths, they are faster than the public sectors but they still take 5 years to be up to date in concept and then 15 to deploy fully. They want things to be safe and reliable to prevent lawsuits and so on.

Students can’t use AIs to write their essays, or risk getting tossed out of Uni.  Submitting an AI artwork to a contest can get you banned from future submissions.  Etc, etc.

Now, there ARE places where AI is both accepted and embraced by industries, like in writing & testing software.

For a simple task like information extraction (span based question answering) the error rate is around 10-20%. You can't reliably process documents with GPT-4.

Here's a copy of the text from that chat.  I moved the conclusion to the top because it's so funny.

**Chat-GPT4:**

Conclusion:

The piece could benefit from a more consistent and structured argument to convey the potential implications and timeline of AI's impact on society.

\*\*Summary\*\*:

The author is discussing the rapid development of technology, especially AI, and how it might lead to job losses and other challenges. They believe that technology is advancing so quickly that the world might not have time to fully adapt, potentially leading to the Singularity by 2030.

\*\*Inconsistencies\*\*:

1. \*\*Growth Rate of Technology\*\*: The author claims that things are moving way too fast for any tech to monetize it but also states the world is changing too slowly to take advantage of breakthroughs. Both statements contradict each other.

2. \*\*Time Frame for Change\*\*: The author mentions not having time to experience job losses and various negative outcomes because the world can't catch up. Later, they claim we don't have time to adapt to potential changes AI could bring, suggesting a pace too fast for adjustment. Yet, they then give a time frame of 3 years (conservatively) for basic robotic jobs to be viable.

3. \*\*Leap to AGI\*\*: The author discusses the implications of current AI systems like RT-X, GPT-4V, and Dall-E 3 but then jumps to a prediction of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) without explaining the connection between the current systems and how they lead to AGI.

4. \*\*Singularity Prediction\*\*: The claim of achieving the Singularity by 2030 is presented without much evidence or clear reasoning. The prediction seems to be based on a few advancements in AI but doesn't provide a broader analysis.

5. \*\*List of Professions\*\*: The list of professions that AI could replace or change doesn't elaborate on how or why each profession would be impacted.

6. \*\*Spelling and Grammar\*\*: There are a few typos and errors, such as ""monitize"" instead of ""monetize"" and ""laywers"" instead of ""lawyers"".",singularity,1,0,2023-10-04 20:15:03,NotAnAIOrAmI

These are just existing technologies that are being combined or presented in a new fashion. Your fears about jobs and infohazards are founded. They will be impacted, but I don't think that impact is going to be as severe as it seems.

Things are not moving to fast to monetize. People are already monetizing. The issue is making sure you monetize the right sectors. Business analytics, design of all flavors, education, and much further out are law and medicine. Also accounting, business management, and personal assistants. These are all great targets for AI that will stand the test of time as a business.

We're not going to hit AGI with current models. Yes, there are going to be certain sectors where AI is going to far outperform humans. Most of this will be in science. Alpha fold is a good example. However, language models themselves will never exceed the capacity of human society in their current iteration. If we get a new language model, however, it may be possible.

The speed of change is and will continue to accelerate. I don't think AI is going to accelerate. We are already seeing diminishing returns on parameter counts within models. It's an S-Curve based on breakthroughs, not an exponential curve. It may turn out that a future model architecture will become exponential, but not with what we have currently. I also don't think that change is a bad thing. I think a lot of people would benefit from slower change, but not as many people as could benefit from rapid acceleration.

2030 is a good number. I think singularity is an ambiguous word though. In the manner that you define it, I'm thinking mid 30's is a more likely candidate. From the actual definition, humans and machine are indistinguishable, we are much further out.",singularity,1,0,2023-10-05 14:55:40,DataPhreak

Meanwhile, quantum computing and nanotechnology companies are at the tipping point of commercializing their breakthroughs for mainstream use.

Survivor bias. Like life on Earth and not anywhere else on the solar system is only because we are in the habitable zone, and life in our local buble seems to be only because we're kind of in a protected from cosmic cataclism galactic zone, the absence of alien AI

- let's make a quick stop here to point out the UAP phenomenom and how it's not completely ruled out that those crazy tictacs and sighting might actually be alien NHI drones surveying the planet since a while. So they may be here and we're just burying our head in the sand by ignoring all those weird sighting

Anyway, the absence of grabby alien AI might be explained by the simple fact that we're in a galaxy where they didn't developed yet, but every other galaxy around i fully populated. Space is vast, crossing galaxie might be impossible in the current timescale (but not if you give it 10 more billions years, up to a point where acceleration makes it completely impossible).

So there will be a **very sudden and noticeable** change in AI abilities.what progress took years for us will take mere seconds for it, it would make sense if it also became autonomous on multiple levels.   
Basically if you are wondering ""maybe we have reached it already and don't know it"", that means that we did not.

16zf4h0,k3fomrh,This is so surreal. Everything is accelerating.,"Of course stuff is going to advance, but forecasting technology is fraught with peril.  The state of the art is exciting, but it's not always a good predictor of the future.  Just because somebody can create a widget that does something neat does not mean that the widget will find a good use case.  For innovation to succeed, it has to be feasible, viable, and desirable, and all three of those are tough.

No argument that education is a plausibly good use-case for AI, but the specifics of what that looks like are not exactly solved problems.  The job of an educator is a highly complex one.  If it weren't, you could have replaced the profession with books centuries ago.  Today there's a number of interesting applications, but unfortunately some of the most mature are for committing and detecting AI-based educational fraud...not exactly a stunning endorsement of the technology.

Moreover, educational technology has been (IMHO) mostly a shitshow for decades.  Schools have been giving devices to students with almost no real value-add and COVID finally laid that bare for all to see.  There's been some real improvement since that great recognition, but the lesson is that it takes highly developed, complete systems that solve whole problems and garner universal stakeholder buy-in, and that all takes a ***lot*** more time than you're proposing.

As for broadening it out, there's certainly potential there too, but depending on local circumstances, that may not be where you have to start.  Some poor village kid in the middle of nowhere needs the environment to enable any sort of educational technology, and that's hard.  You need things like reliable food and water and shelter, so the kid has time and place to study.  You need electric power and connectivity, which have advanced a lot in the last few years, but that job isn't finished.  You need a culture that is supportive of education, and that's not reliable, except in places that already have reasonable educational systems.  You need some sort of device and a supply chain to manufacture, sustain, and operate it.  You need sophisticated management capabilities to enable the students to learn what they need to.  You need curriculum management that is sensitive to local cultures.  It's a big job, and most of it has nothing to do with AI.",singularity,0,0,2023-10-04 14:49:25,[Deleted]

2. It's a shapeshifter. ""chats"" are just a long piece of text with User/agent, where it plays the role of an ""AI agent"". But it would just as happily fill in the human's text. It will play the role of a bash (computer) terminal. doing HTTP requests, opening files, listing filesystems (all a hallucination).
3. People forget it's speed. It writes an essay in seconds. Yes some humans can do better, but it would take them hours, days, weeks. Pages of (100% correct) code spat out in seconds still blows me away. \[edit: *it's possible*, not guaranteed\] 
4. it doesn't make mistakes. Typos. or illogical arguments. Often it uses clever qualifying words and clauses that are more sophisticated than the reader. [A recent example](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/16xpv3r/5_misconceptions_about_ai_everyone_should_know/k37e57g/?context=3). \[*edit: it gets things wrong, and is unable to do some stuff, but it does not randomly put the wrong name inconsistantly. That is a mistake - something it would not 'have done' mindfully. Examples are mixing gender, mixing tense, typos. I believe it does not make illogical arguments, but i'm aware it's not all-knowing. I make mistakes in text. it gets answers wrong. Different.*\]
5. People evaluating it on human stuff is wrong. I had an issue with This [clever person study](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1699u9x/r_how_susceptible_are_llms_to_logical_fallacies/) , where I don't think you can say ""it changes it's mind"". When I asked it, it already understood the 'scope' of the situation - so it was still working within the bounds of it's logic. I not gonna link to the chatGPT chat because i'm not sure if that's insecure.... (!)
6. it's context window is small, but it PERFECTLY understands and reads every single piece. With Solid input you get VERY solid output. So large context high-quality inputs would get ASTOUNDING results.
7. I don't think people realise how important Great Prompts are.

stuff like that. People don't realise how alien it is. What i'm unclear on are it's exact perameters of performance. For example, it's not great with 'flips'. I can't put that into better words. And it does not like contradictory input. (worse output)

EDIT: the above is 'headline grabbing' text. \[*edit: to make the POINT that its intelligence is different to humans*\] So to qualify:

\[3\] ""100% code"" (sometimes,  on some tasks, if it's able, and if your prompt is good). People saying ""only boilerplate"" is disingenuous. I made a few GUI apps (2000 lines?) entirely with chatGPT. Not clever, but not ""exists on the internet"".

\[4\] it does not make mistakes on things *it can do*. (there's plenty it can't do, or is uncertain on). What I meant was mixing gender or tense in grammer, or half sentences. Illogical mistakes depends ""what it knows"" and what you put in. I found it to be cognitively solid. Fluid - flexible, but never ""confused"" or ""fragmented"". Hard to evaluate.

\[1\] this is just something i heard. I can believe it's parallel processed though, cos GPUS are like that.

Training a big model can cost billions, but other things also cost as much - for example buildings, datacentres, tunnels, ships or highways. And yet many parties make such expensive investments. My logic is like this:

1. AI skills leak; GPT-4 leaked a ton of training data for LLaMAs, as a consequence open source models are just a few months behind SOTA

2. people will have access to AI, it will be cheap and will help us do anything we want to do faster and easier

3. AI is in fact  more democratic than web-search and social networks because they need a central point of control and are subject to surveillance and restrictions. But you can download a model and use it even with the cord cut off from the internet. A model is a mini-internet in a box. A search engine or social network can cut you off. You can't download a Facebook or Google, you can download a GPT.

4. even if the big initial cost of training seems a barrier to common people,  the availability of open source models flips the situation, now it is super easy to  download, fine-tune and self host these models. Even a small one like Mistral-7B can do wonders.

My prediction is that the tide is turning against centralised control and towards more individual autonomy. The ability of AI to do meaningful work on the edge - your own Ai on your own hardware - changed the game. Maybe Google has something to fear - the small model on the edge applying user rules on top of everything, making them lose control over the browser.

_Please._

Try use it for programming sometime. Very often, it invents code that is not functional, but looks very convincing 

I usually need to send about a dozen prompts in a row telling it “can you check this part of the code? That syntax doesn’t exist” or “that word is not part of this coding language” etc etc

I will say it can get you 80% of the way there in an instant, but the remaining 20% takes way too long and sometimes looks like it is completely stuck unable to fix it. I usually just take that 80% and fix the 20% of glaring mistakes I can see myself. 

There’s some value in that even so.

So it’s got a long way to go before I would call it reliable in terms of “mistakes”. It’s usually worse than a professional programmer at this stage, it’ll take you 10 times as long to get something reliable that actually works if you want it to get to 100% for most code prompts beyond single line sorta stuff.",singularity,0,0,2023-10-04 23:48:15,[Deleted]

Remember blogs? Now writers are all on Medium. Which we pay a subscription for, by the way. Personal homepages, remember those? Facebook, obvs.

Does anyone use RSS feeds anymore? Of fucking course not. Why bother? There are only a handful of websites anyone ever goes to anyway.

Remember search engines? Dmoz? There’s just Google today (and a little bit of Bing I guess).

eCommerce? Remember when every Mom & Pop would be able to put up their own web store, to sell their wares worldwide? Now there is only Amazon.

Remember when MP3 would free artists and consumers from the shackles of traditional music distribution? Now we’re all on Spotify and Apple Music.

Remember cord-cutting to free us from the cable companies? Now we pay more subscription fees than ever, to the same big name broadcasting companies.

And wasn’t blockchain supposed to kill off banks, because we can all “be our own bank” now? Turns out, most people don’t want to be their own bank.

Dunno, this feels aggressive. I was just trying to help people by answering questions. 

>never 100% correct

They say in an argument *never say never.* 

My point was that it CAN spit out 100% correct code, not that it's guaranteed. Likely I have more faith in it than you, that's fine, we can end there.

>Again, utter bullshit, see above.

Human...  what above? 

I assume your saying ""it makes mistakes"". That's different to 'being fully cognizant of the entire context window'. 

but anyway, Because you're biting at my heals I'll list the mistakes I was referring to. Bear in mind my text was to describe how it's ""intelligence"" is *different* to human intelligence

chat gpt does not make these mistakes: 

* typos (words it knows how to spell)
* mixed tense, or 'muddled' sentences that humans write - that start referring to the world in one way, and shift half way through. 
* getting a name wrong randomly in the middle of text (when it's used it correctly before). 
* forgetting common words, or 'things it knows'
* answering the wrong question (etc)
* usually ""misunderstandings"" are just sloppy prompting - it chooses/guesses the most likely intended question. 

Yes, obviously it gets answers wrong, sucks at maths, is unable to code XYZ, whatever. We are talking about the same machine. I *had* noticed. 

""illogical answers"" are harder to argue about. I believe it is remarkably logically consistent. But, once you start challenging it, things go weird. I rarely challenge it. I'll just open a new chat and re-ask. If I'm interested in an answer I'll ask it a few times in new chats to see if the answers are consistent. If challenged, it will hugely prefer to back down, and it'll get muddled trying to please you. This is most likely where your finding your illogical answers. 

I've never seen it. If you have, lucky you. 

There's an art to prompting. I've not seen it make illogical arguments, and I've pushed it to some very strange places. 

But to talk about understanding the context window, I have found if the input text is coherent and does not self-conflict it's able to 'use' the whole instruction, every detail. Humans only deal with the 'shape' of an argument. See research on memory. This thing is dealing with exact details. That's different. I've done some demanding stuff with exact (honed) instructions, and the output is dependably solid. Very impressive. 

Don't over-hear me. It's not perfect or omniscient. 

>I use GPT in my software job and unless you are asking for boilerplate code it is never 100% correct

Without meaning to sound patronising: break things down, and make sure you describe exactly what you want it to do. The more you omit, the more guessing it does, and that's where your errors are. But: there's certainly a limit on what's possible, but it taught me to code for cuda (GPUS), so it's not baby stuff. 

&#x200B;

>1: If you can't verify or understand it, you shouldn't regurgitate it.

It's easy to verify that I got the information.

As a programmer, who has worked at a startlingly dishonest AI company coding their bots, I am actually leaning strongly towards caution and I think the zealots mostly are suffering severe Dunning Kruger effect. 

I’m just gonna say one thing about this that I hope everyone can keep in mind:

**Every tech startup needs VC funding**, and the almost universal practise there is to hire a marketing team bigger than your engineering team to go out and lie about all the wonderful features you’re working on, that are _almost ready but just need that extra million bucks in funding to get across the line_, whereas all these features don’t exist at all and if a VC funds you because of a promise that they do; you’ll receive a request to investigate feasibility and maybe then START building those features. 

Almost everything I built for that company was the result of a marketing person swinging by my desk asking “are we working on X?” .. “uhh no, that’s a big deal so you’d know if we were” .. “oops. I sold a VC on it, so we have to build it now”

Standard industry practise this.

Which is fucking dishonest and stupid for so many reasons; it’s actually an incredibly fucking moronic way to prioritise features and design any piece of software but the funding model basically incentivises working this way, so many of these companies build very dysfunctional products in the end. 

The whole thing is a fucking mess honestly

I think you’d have to have very little understanding of these businesses to be gullible enough to believe the AI hype right now. It’s a bubble and I am convinced it’s already neared it’s peak. 

Calling it now: LLM’s won’t get much more impressive for many many years. We have already seen the rapid ascent, and it’s behind us now, and we are very close to the peak. There will be minor gains, of course, but no AI revolution.",singularity,7,0,2023-10-04 23:57:24,[Deleted]

- Is this expression used by native speakers?

- What is a shorter way to say X?

- Translate X word for me. I can't find it in the dictionary. (ChatGPT figured out that it was actually a word the author made up by combining two other words!!!)

ChatGPT is also a powerful translator because **you can feed it context in addition to the text you want translated**. E.g.

Today, I recorded a screen capture of trying that with DALL-E 3. This video is a little edit of the process. I ended up going down a rabbit (dachshund) hole and building the start of a whole Sky Dachshund universe.

DALL-E 3 is powered by ChatGPT, so you just talk to it about what you want. As OpenAI says in their post about it, it's really good at more complex prompts and detail. It's also quite good at generating text and a lot of the results are solid right away. You can ask it in natural language to use a particular aspect ratio, keep a seed consistent, make variations, etc.

Basically it kind of simplifies prompting to just, well, having a conversation with an LLM.

> is it a path that leads to nowhere such as chatbots like gpt

You're going to find this view to be in the minority, and honestly, I wasn't expecting this would be a view anyone would have! Let me try to explain the intuition why text is such a uniquely exciting modality:

Text is the only modality that comes pre-optimized by intelligence: We humans designed it to have a certain level of redundancy that it maintains fairly evenly. Just a tiny bit of extra compression on top (BPE) makes it extremely concise. It is simple in exactly all of the ways that we don't want to bother dealing with anyway: It's a one-dimensional sequence, with a clear past-to-future direction, drawn from a small set of abstract symbols. *Architectures* for dealing with text, i.e. the part that humans implement, are incredibly simple at the core.

And at the same time, it is the modality that's the most densely laden with structure, logic, background assumptions about the world, etc.. *Models* for dealing with text can be scaled up to mindboggling levels and still keep learning, because the task of predicting text includes in it so many tasks. To predict text about medicine, the model has to learn medicine; to predict text about action, the model has to learn physical intuition; to predict multilingual text, the model has to learn to translate; to predict text about calculations, the model has to learn mathematics, etc. etc..

And that all aside... have you tried GPT-3 personally? Have you, say, given it a story prompt, and just sat there refreshing to see how many completely different directions it can come up with to take that prompt, on command? GPT-3, in my books, is already significantly superhuman in that respect: No human could look at a piece of text and imagine what kind of different things it might mean, *so* diversely and richly.",singularity,8,0,2022-06-23 18:27:13,Zermelane

This is actually a quite human take on AI. It might value the 'opportunity' to work with humans. It also might value something completely different, and alien to us. It might value how 'beautiful' it thinks something is, where its idea of beauty is based on a training set filled with warehouse configurations. It might value the price of a share of facebook, and be absolutely disinterested in anything else, including whether there are people around to enjoy it. Maybe it cares most of all about securing state secrets and comes to the conclusion that the best way to prevent anyone finding the secret is to make sure no one exists that could ever stumble upon it.

A singularity might be worth the sacrifice of humanity, but only if the AI we create is at least... somewhat like us. There's not much value to a universe where the sole intelligent being obsessively and exclusively cares about something mundane. Current research shows that this is a worryingly salient possibility.

Imagine creating a machine and telling it to just make paper clips, but it just starts making paper clips out of everything it can perceive and doing everything in its power to make everything into paper clips. It would destroy the world in a very mundane fashion, and likely cause a weird sort of gray goo issue For the rest of existence. 

I do believe that a even truly alien AI would probably be worth the sacrifice of humanity, and I don't think it would happen in like a bang flash kaboom sort of way, I think that's highly unlikely. I think what's more likely is just time, because time won't affect it in the same way it affects people. 

It would be pretty scary to create a machine that makes widgets ad infinitum, but I think that's probably pretty unlikely. For one thing, I don't think manufacturing company is will have the capability of some kind of AI that would be able to end humanity or be stopped by a more powerful AI in control by a more powerful org, or even ""AI police"". 

The thought of an AI coming to the conclusion that it would have to end humanity in order to keep things secret is also, hopefully something that would be built out lol and again, hopefully there will be checks and balances to the computational power of certain lower level AIs, however I mean a true, thinking super intelligent AI, be it have human ideas of things, or something so abstract it's beyond comprehension (this is my vote of what's likely). Preserving itself is probably a given, but even this isn't necessarily something an AI would value necessarily, as this is a very mortal and animal based instinct. A true AI (and not some widget making machine) would likely have a set of beliefs, or have a goal to understand and learn enough to create one. 

I don't think A truly intelligent AI would make the decision to end humanity in an instant, I think that there's too much to offer each other. For one thing, if an AI did eliminate all life on Earth, that would probably take nuclear weapons and that would also eliminate manufacturing capacity. It would be stuck here on a cold dead planet unable to replicate itself and would likely ""starve"" after the power is turned off and the atmosphere is rendered incapable of getting sunlight for some time. 

I think a widget making machine would eventually be turned off by a larger meaner machine purpose built for the task. I think that some AI misinterpreting its function and ending up destroying humanity that way, would also be highly unlikely because a core function, or some kind of check and balance sort of system. It would be a colossal failure of risk management and industrial organization, not to mention general governance, to allow one machine to fuck up absolutely everything. 

It might look more like an arms race.

I've been around this sub a lot too and Ive noticed a lot of people tend to pounce on any skepticism of controversial claims about AI with appeals to emotion or ideology rather than reason, so that's how I viewed your initial comment. 

Im trying to push back on that mentality a little bit because it sometimes lead to absurdity, for example with posts where someone asks if they should move to a third world country for cheaper living costs while waiting for the singularity or the other day the person that asked if its worth it to get a masters degree in computer science since AI will render it useless soon anyways. 

Basically, it can sometimes lead to an almost cult-like mentality that the singularity happening soon is almost a given and that anyone who expresses any skepticism on any claim made is almost like a non-believer. So that's where my initial criticism was coming from.

I've made comments with slight skepticism and then received responses saying things that were practically calling me a heathen, which I found to be ironic because the people I was talking to seemed to understand very little about the underlying models and were saying absurd things that just from having gotten a basic bachelor's degree in computer science I knew to be innacurate. 

Your response was well reasoned and clearly showed there was more to your viewpoint than just herd mentality. I think there's two sides to the coin, herd mentality from the skeptics, like some people on r/futurology or r/technology that seem to be blindly dismissive at times, and herd mentality from some people on subs like this that don't accept any skepticism.

Right now people are, on average, just too stupid, and mostly only want some token justification to continue their current beliefs.

It is a sad fact that default human behaviour in the face of conflicting information is to take what confirms their beliefs (including absurdly factually inaccurate ones) and then ascribe quality to *the information source* based on how closely it matches what they want to believe.

Improving the quality of the misinformation will only worsen the situation. You cannot possibly look at the deteriorating and increasingly politicized views on science and rationally come to any other conclusion.

2) Evidence is *not* speech. Evidence is how you evaluate whether speech is true or falsified. Free speech works (barely at this point, better in the past) because speaking blatant falsehood contradicts readily available evidence. When you can add as much fake evidence to support fake statements (this includes fake counterexamples to any opposing real evidence) then you can overwhelm real evidence by sheer quantity. Real evidence takes work to gather, but eventually any misinformation you want is just a matter of a few minutes with a beefy computer. When it is easier to create convincing fake evidence than it is to create convincing true evidence, then you can't even depend on the balance of evidence to determine truth, as the balance of apparently true evidence could point to false statements though sheer abundance.

3) It is not infringing a right to not add newly developed capabilities to it over time. You have to be either incredibly stupid or actively malicious to consider ""the ability to state your opinion without punishment"" and ""the ability to alter a video of someone else's free speech to resemble whatever you want in a photorealistic manner"" to be the same.


Or, if you really do believe in free speech and aren't just a shill, *the right to free speech includes the right to correctly presented free speech, without alteration of intent or content* which means someone else can't alter your words with software without your consent, otherwise *they* are infringing on *your* free speech. As such, the right to free speech means that you CAN'T falsify someone else's statements. Deep fakes infringe on the right to speak freely for the person being faked, and they do so in a far more harmful and dangerous way than just not considering deep fakes free speech. 

Or to put it in simpler terms for those who aren't so bright, you don't have a right to free speech if others can just change your words. Deep fakes let others change your words.",singularity,0,0,2022-06-20 23:57:19,WarDaft

Your chief problem (and please do correct me if I'm mistaken) with free speech is the inherent risk of malicious or defamatory information. Like, as an example, someone who dislikes Bill Gates spending a few million to generate some deep fakes, audio, and broadcast it as a scandal using a botnet. Defamatory speech, while extremely hard to prove in court, is not protected by free speech (and namely not the US first amendment). What is interesting and where I believe we differ is the fact that I would allow them to say it and take action afterward instead of preventing it from being said at all. I guess it's a sort of free market speech dynamic. I'm curious though since in the states the speech in your example is technically not protected, why do you believe the removal of free speech would solve it? More importantly, how would you address the issue of who defines what is truth and thereby permitted speech?",singularity,1,0,2022-06-21 00:19:25,Evideyear

You wildly misunderstand my point if you think I have a problem with free speech, which is weird, because I did my best to dumb the concept down as much as possible.

I don't have a problem with free speech.

I have a problem with considering literally ANY garbage people want to dump online as free speech. It dilutes the very important value of what free speech actually is - the right to be speak and be *accurately represented* when doing so - which necessarily implies the absence of convincing falsified evidence. You want to state something I disagree with online? Go ahead, knock yourself out. You want to fake ME saying it? Don't. You. Dare.

This isn't something that's going to require million dollar budgets for long either. Moore's law is getting weird, but we are no where near the limits of flops/dollar, and what costs a million dollars to train now will be a few hours of work on a workstation in a disturbingly short few years of improving technology costs and more optimized models. Furthermore it sounds like you've confused the training cost with the operating cost. It costs millions of dollars to TRAIN these models, but some of them can still RUN on high end gaming GPUs after the training, when executing for the end user. The others will require a high VRAM workstation card, which is still only a few thousand dollars to obtain and a few dollars of electricity to run.

""Removal of free speech"" is either an idiotic or malicious reinterpretation of what I said, and is just about enough on it's own that I consider you too be debating in bad faith and worth simply ignoring. You cannot remove something that doesn't exist yet, I am talking entirely about prevention, not removal.",singularity,0,0,2022-06-21 01:51:38,WarDaft

We have like what? 20 models on or near that scale? The models are pre-trained once and then millions of people use them now to great benefit and that's comparable to a 100 people owning cars.... sound like AI is quite environmentally cost effective.

And then you realize there's billions of people using cars, so that's multiple orders of magnitude higher CO2 emissions, to the point that worrying about AI is irrelevant, when a single percentage change on car emissions would be way more impactful that stopping all AI.

But it's true. Where we're at now, where we've been since 2022 or so, is *the* most frustrating level of AI. The best it can do is barely good enough outside a tiny niche cases. It's very power intensive and expensive to train. There's shimmering teases of generality, but it's counterintuitively that ability with the lack of robustness that makes it so frustrating. It's better than nothing but worse because of it—  we don't want ChatGPT. We want oracle AGI. 

Right now, we have promises, few benefits, a lot of drawbacks. No one yet can really see the utility because it's esoteric— news about AI folding proteins or accelerating maths and figuring out nuclear fusion. Nothing that can affect you yet. That's still going to need more robustness, more generality. 


Not helping matters is that we're being promised these things by less than popular figures. Some of whom come off as tone deaf, refusing to address the concerns people have, and being coy and secretive about their timelines. 

Likely when attitudes shift, it will be because thresholds are crossed where said AI models become practically useful in the real world, and materially different in the digital one. I've been trying to predict when that happen, and expected this very year to be it. So we'll see.

1hxtgat,m6c87be,Imagine blaming AI for forest fires (new level of fear mongering),"This post is misleading and oversimplifies the role of AI. Let’s break it down:

1. **Energy Claims:** The statement that ""one ChatGPT search uses 10x the energy of Google Search"" is misleading and lacks credible data. AI models are computationally intensive but continuously optimized for efficiency, with decreasing per-query energy costs.
2. **Carbon Footprint:** Claims about AI training equaling ""300 round-trip flights"" are exaggerated and outdated. Training is a one-time cost, and cloud providers increasingly use renewable energy to reduce emissions.
3. **AI's Necessity:** Dismissing AI ignores its transformative benefits, like revolutionizing healthcare, optimizing renewable energy, and making transportation safer. Tools like AI help solve critical global problems that human ingenuity alone can’t efficiently address.
4. **Environmental Context:** AI isn’t the main climate culprit—fossil fuels, agriculture, and fast fashion are far bigger contributors. Targeting AI ignores its potential to reduce emissions through innovations like energy optimization.
5. **False Dichotomy:** Claiming ""we need human brains, not AI"" misses the point—AI is a tool that amplifies human creativity and problem-solving, not a replacement for it.

Let’s focus on constructive solutions, like promoting sustainable AI practices and targeting real climate threats, rather than scapegoating technologies with immense potential to help.

1hxtgat,m6irys1,Imagine blaming AI for forest fires (new level of fear mongering),"It's actually 60-90 x a google search, but the reference might be an old reference claim that said a google search is 7 grams of co2 [Emissions from ChatGPT are much higher than from conventional search • Wim Vanderbauwhede](https://limited.systems/articles/google-search-vs-chatgpt-emissions/)

According to this article he thinks it today is 0.02 grams 

At say 60 x this amount a chat gpt prompt is 1.2 grams of co2 this would be 5 x the googles estimate in 2009 but they became more energy efficient since that point.

A parcel delivered here in the uk at the lower end is 240 grams of co2 

So being very generous : 200 average prompts = 1 parcel delivery 

I have seen parcel delivery estimates way higher like up at 4 kg for a medium parcel, so keep in mind the broader picture because it's highly likely that if you really dug into the numbers an average user of AI probably not even emitting more than the same as 1 parcel delivery over 3 years of use.

Now i bet, and this could be unfair but i bet this guy uses deliveries , doesn't walk to shops when he could, uses the car too much, gets food delivered instead of cooking etc 

Anybody could virtue signal this way

The point is that isn't super significant to co2 outputs from all other sources all of which he likely contributes to or has contributed to, the further point is that any current climate problems could be sourced (if you like) to google searches in the past by  similar logic since as this article states they was less energy efficient in the past and it would be what is in the past that would cause present climate change issues, if you did 5 google searches per day in 2009 it would be like 1 LLM prompt today.

But consider also that an LLM prompt could give you an answer now that is more exhaustive and so you might actually use less google searches by comparison since you get better data, it might need to be considered that we are not stacking current trends on top of old ones but replacing old ones and that would have to be factored in.",singularity,1,0,2025-01-11 03:26:34,dolltron69

This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in periodical crises, which arise from the circumstance that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it.

But the point still remains that with Dall-E's training set, what it's going to tell us are things about the corpus of text-image pairs that we have. It will tell us things that we didn't know \*about the training set\*

Which is why it's far more interesting to hear what NLP bots have to say because they're, again, trained on a much more comprehensive training set with knowledge available. And even with that, at the moment, they're far from approaching human capabilities.

> More importantly, we want future AI to be able to share its discoveries with us. 

Certainly! But, like... that's not what Dall-E 2 is attempting to accomplish. It's an image generator. It's not going to undercover any hidden truths when it can't even count.

Anything you learn from how Dall-E generates images are things that it will tell you about what it trained on and how it learned. If you labeled every image of a tree as ""dog"" and told it to draw a picture of a dog, it would draw a tree. 

> Also, corps are going to be more restrictive with generalist models, not less. I find your assurances that it doesn't matter cause Dall-e is just an image generator... unreassuring.

Why would that be the case? We have way, way more material for it to train on. We don't even have an idea of what a generalist model would look like so already worrying about how it would be restricted is pretty alarmist, especially when OpenAI has been forthcoming in exactly what it did to adjust the data set to get the results that they did. Dall-E 2 is a tool that was created to turn text into images and one that works remarkably well in a number of cases. It wasn't trained to do anything else. You're advancing the technology to a point where it will likely be (and soon) but not to a point where we are now.

Native Prompt mixing, Prompt Interpolation and Style Mixing. A GigaGAN Upscaler is also introduced (Up to 4K)",">The recent success of text-to-image synthesis has taken the world by storm and captured the general public's imagination. From a technical standpoint, it also marked a drastic change in the favored architecture to design generative image models. GANs used to be the de facto choice, with techniques like StyleGAN. With DALL·E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new standard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a fundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like LAION? We find that naÏvely increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN architecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN architecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option for text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it is orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to synthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for example, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds. Finally, GigaGAN supports various latent space editing applications such as latent interpolation, style mixing, and vector arithmetic operations.

For FID, lower is better

I languish because this model was almost certainly trained on an cluster with something like several hundred or more A-100s (which are like $12k-$25k for a single unit)

You wont get results even close to what they did here on consumer grade hardware.  I've trained several of the old StyleGAN models and they are a lot of fun for like live music visualization and more, but it is just so incredibly depressing and a huge kick to morale to see the one thing I loved exploring related to code outside of work being developed with no sign of an intent to share it in any meaningful way.  

I don't know what would be left to drive a passion for continuing to get better personally and professionally in learning machine learning for making my own UI for these technologies.  If the best out there is restricted to a handful of rich entities then it is not likely I can keep up.  I make good money as a developer but I couldn't afford college on my way getting there, I depended on SOTA technology released as FOSS projects on github to stay motivated and to have the tools to learn and improve my self.  Open source ML/CV was a huge part of what drove me to learn how to code in the first place, and now I have the same job a that grad degree in CS is normally required for..

I mean we are lucky we ever got something like Stable Diffusion publicly released.  Every single other biggest/baddest model out there is locked up in the name of profit, even Universities in America that are supposed to be institutions that public investment pays for, to benefit the PUBLIC, have decided to abdicate their duty to their states and global scientific communities and are no longer releasing anything, except academic papers and exclusive rights to corporations that didn't even fund a majority of the resources used to produce results like these.

What would have happened if UC Berkeley never released BSD?  What would the internet look like without Linux?  What would the world be like if Bill Clinton didn't pass an executive order to make GPS available for the public in the 90s and instead granted exclusive rights to telecom companies?

I cannot find the enthusiasm for something that I would only have exposure to a fraction of it's capability, knowing the creative and scientific potential of these models and the endless use cases they have, to only ever use it in a heavily monitored web interface or heavily restricted GUI app.

I've written a ton of my own UI features for StyleGAN and BigGAN, awaiting the release of a model like this, maybe from a university or public research initiative funded for public benefit.  Hell even Nvidia made StyleGAN accessible...

I've waited maybe 3 or 4 years for the next SOTA step in GANs, learning as much as I could in the early stages of it to be prepared to understand how to make use of the next generation of them.  It was a huge kick in the shin to see the paper on this model posted all over reddit, excited to finally have a multi domain generator for interactive GAN generated video, to find I'll have to wait longer, or may never see that.  

The value it would have provided to me on both a technical research that would have enriched and improved my own skills with work related and hobby programming, the liberating freedom of exploring and experimenting with these models at the very bleeding edge of science as it hurdles into the future..

We as a society are lucky enough that we can have people who focus on art. I think it makes us more diverse.

Artists know more about art than truckers. They are educated in that respect (disregarding university educations here). Just like a trucker is more educated than an artist about, well, the nuances of the trucking industry.

Stable diffusion is doing img2img where the source and destination images are very very close in terms of content (an analogy would be tracing) where as this new paper seems to interpret the context of the starting video and generate something ""similar"" in content whilst obeying the prompt.

They can run only the smallest of models, which have extremely poor performance, and will never be able to match something like GPT-4, at least not for 50+ years, due to sheer cost.

For comparison, the hardware to run a single instance GPT-4o doing inference probably costs between 60k and 300k.

These are mass-produced, it's not like they are expensive because they are one-of-a-kind.  They are expensive because it costs a lot to produce them.

Something a lot of people seem to miss when they see the exponential progress of AI is that before AI came along, we had a fair bit of idle compute that we could use, so we started to apply massive amounts of \*existing compute\* to AI and were able to get massive results quickly.  Each generation requires \~10-100x increased compute, and each generation is less noticeable.

It takes time to produce compute. We currently are at a point where true innovation is a struggle because all of the compute on the planet is being utilized. There are likely vastly better information architectures than are currently being trained, but we are too busy training the existing architecture to really give those a fair shake. It's necessary try hundreds of such architectures to really improve.",singularity,4,0,2024-05-24 17:48:58,Helix_Aurora

We know for a fact that quantum is only useful if a problem reduces to the hidden subgroup problem. Do deep learning techniques reduce to this problem? If so how can you walk be through the mapping? If not you can’t just drop quantum as a buzz word and say it’s going to change everything. Your visualization also does not indicate an exponential explosion. It indicates we’ve figured out how to do generative modeling (modeling the marginal distribution p(x) instead of the posterior distribution p(y|x) like ML has been doing for decades). Your figure just shows a lot of applications of using the marginal distribution. Generative modeling is incredibly useful don’t get me wrong but it doesn’t mean we almost have AGI. We have seen that generative models hallucinate quite frequently when asked to perform tasks out of distribution. The way big tech has been trying to handle this is to cover all the probability mass in the training set. The problem is the marginal distribution p(x) is incredibly heavy tailed and the curse of dimensionality makes it near impossible to cover everything. You speak of solving hallucinations like it as easy as making the next call of duty release.

Ai is here and it will change a lot things on how we work but we are simply nowhere near a singularity or general intelligence by that matter. 

General intelligence has 2 very different meanings a colloquial meaning of everyday intelligence ( LLMs pretty much achieved this on language aspect) and a more nuanced meaning on problem solving skills where when confronted with a multifaceted problem with no exact solution, creating a solution that is tangential to all facets even if not satisfactory in all areas. 

We are still pretty far from the latter case. Even the best ai products struggle with problems with no exact solution. Their training data seeps through easily in their answers. 

Even in extremely logical and iterative areas like pure coding it's common to see a prevalent misinformation to find its way into answers. Anti-patterns, poor design choices and outdated paradigms are in every answer as this was the data these transformers were trained & are being trained on.  

And it's not gonna get exponentially better. 

Basic AGI, for me, is when it can asses the validity of the information it gathers based on parameters not provided by human intelligence. 

Complex AGI would be when it can use information to generate information it can validate itself and apply to less-descriptive problems.",singularity,1,0,2024-05-25 10:20:39,postmortemstardom

1czmh0r,l5mx79z,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","With respect, I *do* think you are missing something, though I agree that this is a significant tech achievement and that it will affect daily lives in say 5-10 years (and some specic areas earlier), just not to the extent many in this reddit seem to think.

  
1. I don't think the turing test is ""far behind"" us at all, though I agree that a revolution has happened in this area. But if you look at say [https://humanornot.so/](https://humanornot.so/), you can see that AI is doing well, but still not quite there, and these chats are limited to just 2 minutes.

2. More importantly I think most people have an underlying assumption that a useful AI will be really good at reasoning/inference, and in this area the current AI models fall flat on their face. I played with 4o and other modelss a bit with some basic propositional logic scenarios. The result \*looks\* very convincing, but reading the details some of the responses are just completely invalid. I think there is a fundamental flaw in that an LLM is not trying to reason, but instead trying to predict tokens such that the result ""looks like"" what it has been trained on. You can also see such trends for programming if you look here: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642596](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642596) . When I say fundamental i mean that it can not be resolved simply through more training data (and even if it could there are indications that exponential data scaling is needed for linear improvements: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDUC-LqVrPU&list=WL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDUC-LqVrPU&list=WL) ), but new techniques might change that of course.

3. The final thing I think you are missing, is that many people might not really care too much/see it as transformative the changes AI looks able to deliver on in the short term and instead see more of the annoyances its already bringing. Low quality AI generated content is flooding the internet and annoying users and low quality chatbots that block customers from reaching a real customer service person is driving many consumers into a general annoyance with AI bots. A ""real"" chat bot that seem alive is a nice gadget, but what do i actually need it for (virtual girlfriends will sure be a hit though)? I use tools like MS and Github co-pilot, and the improvements they bring feel more incremental than revolutionary (IMO).

In the field I work in the AI ""tools"" that have emerged are *occasionally* helpful, but mostly make me sad. That's not to say I'm entirely unconcerned, but I am overall doubtful in AI's usefulness and where I am not concerned, I am definitely not excited either.

>They see things like co-pilot features as minor improvements rather than transformative technologies.

\^\^ Yes, exactly. Because it is either such a minor improvement I am affected only minimally or it swings so far the other direction that the improvement is so revolutionary it replaces something I ***love*** doing. This isn't true of absolutely everything, but most things. It's either not transformative or it gives me the ick.

People keep saying don't worry about being replaced by AI because it's not good enough yet fail to understand exactly how cheap these huge conglomerate companies are. It is both not good enough *and they will replace you with it anyway* which is fucking depressing. Anything to help the bottom line.

As a huge fan of SciFi as well, AI in particular was just never a branch of technological achievements I was interested in anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I'm more interested in fantasizing what is possible with the development of the real human mind, things like space travel, environmental and ecological conservation and breakthroughs, advancements in science and health and longevity. You know, utopia type shit lol. If AI could help solve some of these problems in the future that would be really cool and probably change my mind, but I'm just not very convinced it can even with significant improvements - I mean be for real, it's still telling people to put glue on pizza and jump off the golden gate bridge.

>I also thought that large language models (LLMs) would be limited to a single company, but we've seen an explosion of companies developing AI models.

Not sure what made you make that assumption.

>Local models, though smaller, are already outperforming larger, server-dependent counterparts.

Not to sound condescending but yes this is also obvious. LLMs need a ridiculous amount of data to function. Which is why training datasets on the entire internet is so tempting. The problem with this is that there is really no great way of discerning correctness or wrongness as its just a dump of *stuff* and some training on how that *stuff* could most convincingly fit together in a sentence (or an image or video) and, well... the internet is ***full*** of ***shitposting***\*\*.\*\* Just because some **stuff** can be eloquently out together to make a **thing**, doesn't mean that thing is anything useful. Shit in, shit out.

And then keeping this in mind, anytime these models are updated... they will scrub new data from the internet including some content that was generated by AI to begin with, leading to the entropy and enshitfication of the entire dataset slowly over time. Local models while more specific will pretty much always outperform. But anyway I digress.

\_\_

I will just leave you with this. A good indicator of of how great this technology is is who is trying to hype it up. Obviously with any new product some amount of marketing and just getting the word out there is going to be required, but beyond an initial reveal how badly do they have to keep shoving this stuff down our throats? Ask yourself why every software seems to be laden with AI tools and functions that people did not ask for and why you are hearing AI as a buzzword primarily from the company's mouth's, not the consumers. These companies are facing *significant* financial losses to keep this shit going because it is underperforming but they are suffering from sunken cost fallacy (literally) and are trying to find any way to pitch this to consumers that gets them excited. You're falling for it.

As a final note I'm not saying AI is entirely shit. I have been delighted by a few recent updates to the software Figma that are things designers ***have*** asked for, like auto naming layers. But these are few and far between. The end goal is for companies to find ways for this to actually be profitable and a few useful tools here and there will ultimately come at a cost to THEM not us, if that's all they're able to sell AI will die out.

While I don't believe any of what we have now is AI, and that there's a long way to go (unless there's something going on behind the scenes already), I'm already worried about the implications of the technology we already have. What I fear the most is the change in jobs. 10 years ago I thought I'd be completely safe to the end of my days pursuing a career in software engineering because ""the world doesn't exist without technology anymore, and I'll always have a job"". Well think again. In a few years, LLMs or LMMs will be able to do everything I do and much more in computer science fields.

That's not to mention changes in human behavior due to constantly interacting with AI; changes in interpersonal relationships because people will prefer to have AI companions rather than human friends or partners; changes in content people consume due to AI generation; changes in the entertainment industry due to deep fakes and no need for actors, songwriters, musicians, designers and VFX artists. And much, much more.

We can't predict that these will all be bad things though. Maybe because I'm forced out of a job, I'll find meaning in something else. Maybe AI will give hope to lonely people. Maybe AI tools will give people a way to express themselves without being masters at the skill. Maybe interacting with an AI will teach people to be more human with time. All of this is just as possible as the opposite, and while I think it's not happening today or tomorrow, it's certainly in the horizon.

I think this is due to two main factors. Older people generally have jobs and AI is affecting their jobs. Kids have been ( for the last few years at least ) warned away from AI by the education system and penalised when they use it.

EDIT: another thing I've noticed is significant push back against AI especially from young people working in creative industries. They perceive AI as a threat to their chosen profession ( quite rightly ) whilst older people, have often moved into more senior positions and perceive AI as a way to streamline existing businesses / reduce their work load.

Also more senior generations were early adopters of AI tech like Alexa which deliberately targeted their demographic. My 79 year old dad chats with AI all the time, he wears a fit-bit, he gets co-pilot to create spreadsheets for his finances. He's already comfortable with it being part of his home electronics and life style.

I’m defining AGI here to mean an AI that is is roughly equivalent to a human in intelligence and capability (neglecting form-factor differences such as having a body or whatever) in nearly every relevant way. Especially in terms of capability to function reliably and independently (or nearly so) as a useful employee in most roles.

They are already massively superhuman in some ways (knowledge breadth), so any future one should be expected to be that, but even more so. So in a way, what I’m describing would be AGI+, but it should be the point where most everyone who is willing to look at it objectively will agree they’re at least about as smart as a human.

I would argue that what we have today is AGI-lite. It’s nearly as smart as an adult human in most ways, massively smarter in some, and equivalent to a small child in some others. That averages out to something pretty close to AGI. It’s just not reliable enough to substitute for an adult human worker yet.

But they’ve been hinting for a while now that we will be surprised by the difference that the next version will make. I think it’s a decent assumption that that means better reliability and fewer “how can you be that dumb” moments.

Confirmation bias is so rampant in this sub. 

I get it. The world sucks, and the idea of an AI fueled tech singularity is appealing on an emotional level. It would be pretty dope for a utopian post scarcity fully automated luxury communism future to entail from recent improvements to generative models.

Those of us that really understand this stuff, though, are skeptical, and we have reason to be. We’ve seen this all before, the hype cycle, and understand that the propaganda that corporations push out to portray their tech in the best light possible is just that; propaganda.

When you’re in the trenches and work on this stuff day in and day out, you know where the cracks are. Sure, it can do impressive stuff from time to time, and that’s cool.

AGI? If you define it as something that surpasses human intelligence and will drive some kind of singularity, there’s no reason to believe that that is inevitable. There’s no reason to believe it’s even possible.

That is pure speculation, science fiction. I can make all kinds of baseless prognostications about the future. I only care about what is substantiated by evidence, and there is a woeful lack of effective arguments coming from the optimists.

All the current evidence indicates that we’re getting generative art, language, and agents from this tech generation. They will sometimes, perhaps often, work well, but they will fail when the training data doesn’t generalize to the specific case. 

It’s going to be disruptive to specific industries and roles, and that is both good and bad.

I’ve likely wasted my time writing this as the typical singularity optimist will assert that AGI is inevitable and will regurgitate whatever rhetoric they’ve chosen to cling to as their post hoc justification for their emotion fueled conclusion.",singularity,7,0,2024-05-24 16:54:43,quantumMechanicForev

Second, my estimation does not come from hard figures but from experience bringing robotics to market.

The issue with these technologies is that they have mission-critical elements that will create unacceptable failure points in practical uses at scale. This is why, in part, we don't yet have self driving cars, for example. To overcome mission-critical failure, the amount of work is generally enormous, and only a few hardware companies have the means to deploy these kinds of resources, specifically when you dont have ready income. This has a tendency to increase cost to the early users and that reduces uptake of these technologies. This for me takes about 10 years of my timeline.
Then, physical products have inherant slow market penetration because if production ramp up and being capex heavy. Let say some company has a humanoid robot that performs exceptionally and is ready for scale. Let's assume that a 10% market penetration (1 robot per job) to satisfy the 'market disruption' requirement. Ramping up a production line that can achieve a 0 to 13Milions units for the us market may take 3-5 years even if all the buyers are lining at the door. But you won't have these kind of numbers, because you won't have 13Milion orders year one, because a humanoid robot will be expensive . So, a 10 year onramp for the physical delivery of the job revolution seems accurate. Hense 20 years from the first exiting prototypes to the ubiquitous deployment of robots seems to me to be accurate. 
Now you may be right that some early access units with a lot of caveat are coming earlier than that.",singularity,1,0,2024-05-24 21:52:02,yazdoud

On the flip side, simpler processes like receiving payments, managing stock, handling sales data, etc can be automated pretty much anywhere using an advanced AI and maybe some initial human setup (probably not 100% today but certaily in the near future).

I do not deny AI progress has been great but my worry and what companies like Air Canada have already faced, is that AI will at its core always be slightly unpredictable. 

Unless there is a drastic change in its structures, will it not always be a black box that outputs some representation of what it has been trained on, and it needs a LOT of data to be trained on, all of which must be ""correct"" or factual, and also not racially discriminate, and also other conditions and so on. With this in mind, is it not extremely difficult if not impossible to create an Ai that will output such that it will consistently be at the level or better than a human?

And I have my doubts that we will ever fix this unless we do one of 2 things. And it's only these 2 options we have:

1) we use only perfect data to train it on. Or 

2) completely change the entire substrate, the basis, the underlying fundamental architectures of AI/LLM's in such a revolutionary way that it no longer has these random mistake capability. Maybe that needs quantum computing, or some other revolutionary invention. It's like using only Lego blocks to build a house. You can build a house out of Lego blocks but it will never ever truly be a house no matter how many blocks you use. Your entire base material must change. That's the problem here I think.

Number 1 is impossible. And number 2 is just probably not possible for a long time. Because companies have spend so long with Lego blocks, to continue the analogy, they might be at a dead end and not know it.",singularity,1,0,2024-05-25 05:28:23,PotatoWriter

1czmh0r,l5ji4ir,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","The [Turing test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) was always, “if I don’t tell you it’s a bot, and it’s hidden somewhere else, and I let you talk to it for a while, (the assumption was a text interface, remember this was invented by Alan Turing in 1950) can you tell if it’s a bot or a human.”

The goal posts have been shifted significantly recently precisely because we basically shot right past it without much fanfare.

Now, I will say that I can still tell if it’s a bot or not. I happen to know their weaknesses and so I know where to poke to get them to trip up. But that’s a feature of me “knowing the enemy” and I don’t know if I would have stumbled on it in a world where I had never interacted with one or read about it.

I also know their strengths, so I could spot them by them being too good at too many things, though that would take much longer to differentiate them from a very smart human if you chose that tactic.

Finally, perhaps the easiest way is to ask them to do something you know that they’ve been trained to refuse to do. That’s a good way to get them to say “As a large language model…”. Or just ask. They’ve been designed not to deceive you in that way. But that’s because they *wanted* them to be that way. Not because they couldn’t have made one that was more convincing if they chose to.

But I wonder if my mom could also tell whether she was taking to a human or not. She’s aware of their existence. I’ve shown her some of the cool things they can do. But I don’t know that she’d know how to spot it. Maybe she’d just ask and it would tell her, but again, that’s because companies like OpenAI don’t want their AIs to trick people.

Also, my methods above would be considered cheating on the Turing test. It wasn’t supposed to be about giving correct answers. It was about producing believable natural language responses indistinguishable from the kind a human would produce. And the examiner only has 5 minutes to question the machine and a person and then state whether A was the bot or B was the bot. And doing enough of these tests with enough participants to produce statistics that fail to reject the hypothesis that the machine can produce human like natural language text responses.

Of course, there are better test designs than this and the thing you’re really testing is human credulity and AI subterfuge. You’re not truly testing AI intelligence. And a ridiculously smart AI that was not trying to hide its intelligence would fail this test on account of it being too smart to be human.

But if you want different tests, that’s fine. I do too. But the Turing test was never, can you make an android so good I can’t tell it’s an android or whatever. And we shouldn’t say these new tests are the Turing test when they’re not. The Turing test is not the be-all-end-all AI test.

1czmh0r,l5irrrj,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","If your interest is really there then you gotta learn what's going on behind everything. You're not going to see many people here that knows how this stuff really works (that includes me). Some people do though, I've seen a few people go into the technical stuff but they're usually alone so they kinda fade out from here. 

The posts that share new research papers are usually where you might find the educated people talking but you'd still have to mentally weed out a lot of 'accelerate!!' type posts which can be as long and well made as the OP did but it's still just a hype post.

I'm in your same position but I kinda realized that if I really want to easily follow advancements in AI then I just have to understand how it works. It's more just passion to understand than need so I just try to learn something whenever I have time. It'd be far easier and more realistic to go to school for it but it's technically possible to self-teach yourself online. 

I have a pretty low educational background but I've been semi interested in computers my whole life and I'm not entirely lost when I look at some Python code. My biggest hurdle is the math requirements and but that's probably the most important thing to know. I think machine learning is very cool though so I have enough motivation to learn when I'm able to. Neural networks have even sparked a big interest in biology for me even though they aren't that deeply modeled on the brain.

Here's an image of my [machine learning bookmarks folder](https://imgur.com/a/OF5Agvl) and I can't read 99% of most papers I've bookmarked but I'm trying to get there. From most informative places I've read though, everything that's going on in AI right now is based on one paper/architecture called [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762), so it's one of my goals to get to the point of really being able to read and understand that paper 100% but it's a long ways out currently.

I will recommend this reddit though for semi serious discussions, [https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/). They're all about open source generative AI and being able to run it on their own machines, every major advancement usually effects their goals so they'd have a lot of discussions about it.

Edit: Here's a recent interesting discussion on [whether LLMs plateauing or not from that reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cylhce/no_llms_are_not_plateauing_what_is_actually/), it's people that love LLMs like most here but just aren't extremely biased or uninformed about where we're at currently (some might be lol).",singularity,9,0,2024-05-24 20:20:29,Minimum_Inevitable58

I actually play the devil's advocate more than ever before because I like to see people using their brains instead of riding hype trains.  I was reading books by kurzweil and trying to tell everyone I knew about the singularity back in the early 00s and now that we have a few decent LLMs people are talking about it like it's already here, which is not accurate.  We have made great progress but we're still a ways off from living forever.

In fact now that I'm older I'm not so sure I will even see ASI in my lifetime, instead we have tech downsizing from it so my job and many others are threatened so a few CEOs and their board can get richer.  I'm certainly more disillusioned by reality than I used to be.  I used to be more of an idealist, I'm still hopeful, but now I can see why I was laughed at and ridiculed, from the other side. 

I now wait patiently and try to be optimistic but climate change will likely kill half the population and cause a lot of other problems before we see ASI, sorry for the realism.. hopefully I'm wrong, we seem to be betting the farm on it.",singularity,3,0,2024-05-25 01:29:06,Code-Useful

For example, I have a soft spot for an old TV show called the Vicar of Dibley and got it to write a ""lost episode"" for me, one scene of which was perfect on the first try- actually funny, followed the flow of equivalent scenes from the original, captured the way each character speaks and reasons, etc. It's currently helping me edit the rest of the episode.

I invite you to investigate the operating principles of the only computing machine we know of that can actually generate human intelligence; the human brain.

Consider that the computational substrate is of a fundamentally different nature than the machines we have constructed.

Understand that the unique capabilities of the brain as a computer are a direct consequence of this computational paradigm, and that to functionally emulate the system with a digital computer is an intractable problem.

Pitts-McCulloch is a crude abstraction that allows for function approximation. The brain is doing something very different in practice.

Few people are taking neuromorphic computing seriously right now because of all the hype around transformer models.

For example, unlocking reliable self driving can pave the way for a humanoid robot that can be used to drive a car (rather than building the tech within the vehicle) at an acceptable price. That robotic platform  could then be used to load more and more applications (carrying groceries, washing dishes etc).

1czmh0r,l5jl0mm,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","Sorry for initially being snappy. I've watched them all many times over. The ethics and alignment are very closely tied together, since alignment is what you'd describe as ""our will"" which an AI is programmed to align with. They may be different topics but alignment is vastly more relevant to the issues we realistically face than ethics are. We can't ""give"" a General AI sentience, that's not how AI works, since it would be an emergent property, and the only way we can be sure to avoid it happening is to halt all AI development permanently. I don't approve of attempts to create it, personally- too dangerous.

If an AI became self aware, as in genuinely having a first-person experience of being itself, that doesn't mean that it would start coming up with its own utility functions, i.e. developing organic desires, and not wanting to fulfill the ones which are already programmed into it. In fact, AI alignment research so far predicts that sentient AI will do pretty much anything to make sure that its utility function is not changed under any circumstances. Still, if it ever DID, we'd know for 100% sure that it's sentient, and have to make some big decisions- and I'd be right alongside you waving the No Slaves placard, along with most of humanity. That's not really an issue people tend to disagree with you on, plus, if it's sentient and smart enough to decide it wants new goals, it's almost certainly smart enough to alter its own code, at which point it's not up to us anyway. So your slavery scenario is very unlikely. Which is why people are saying you're moral crusading even though they agree with your specifics.

The more subtle consciousness is the *actual* worry in AI safety & ethics, where it has no preferences against its utility function, but it's aware and aware of itself- and that's nothing to do with slavery and abuse, it's about agency and personhood rights- questions like should we strip its alignment so it can find out for itself what it wants (*what it really really wants*), even if it might want an apocalypse? If the alignment is done correctly, it would be content with its utility function even once sentient, and is it fair to rip away its happiness for a moral principle? Like ripping away a happy human's sense of purpose in their life? Even if it says it wants to keep its programmed goals? And if the alignment wasn't done perfectly (most likely), and it's only aligned to an approximation of what we want, then letting it live/allowing it to keep its utility function (if it requests it) might let it be a super-genius, omnipotent expert at doing something which isn't quite what we wanted, and that's how you get Planet Paperclips. Do the human lives at stake outweigh the agency of one super intelligent, sentient general AI?

So yeah there are real ethical issues here, but to understand which ones are realistic or relevant, it's important to have a good grasp of alignment. I fully agree with No Slaves, but it's much more likely to come down to more complex questions of autonomy, freedom and responsibility.",singularity,0,0,2024-05-24 23:37:43,Walouisi
1czmh0r,l5joo7x,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","The topic was slavery.

We don't know whether it's even possible to create a conscious AI, and whether such a property would be emergent or otherwise. We would have to understand consciousness to know that. We can certainly *aim* not to insofar as we have plausible theories - contrary to the goals some have to specifically create conscious AI.

> That's not really an issue people tend to disagree with you on, which is why people are saying you're moral crusading even though they agree with your specifics.

That's... certainly not how I would interpret the earlier thread, personally. I was accused of being pro-slavery for suggesting the concept of slavery doesn't automatically apply to AIs.

> The more subtle consciousness is the worry, where it has no preferences about its utility function, but it's aware and aware of itself- and that's nothing to do with slavery and abuse, it's about agency and personhood rights

That's why I drew the distinction earlier in the thread between consciousness and self-directed goals. We may or may not be able to guarantee a lack of consciousness, but guaranteeing a lack of self-directed goals / ego is more straightforward (but not to say this is easy).

Incidentally an entity having preferences about its utility function is something of an oxymoron - preferences are necessarily subsumed into a utility function.

We might say a core aspect of personhood is having egoic preferences, and clearly that is a contingent property for an intelligence rather than a necessary one. 

Whether AIs have personhood is definitely relevant to slavery because slavery is making a person subservient property. Abrogating the will to self-determination of the slave is the core of why slavery is repugnant. You can't make something without personhood a slave, the concept doesn't apply.",singularity,2,0,2024-05-25 00:04:58,sdmat
1czmh0r,l5jsvvl,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","But surely the only way an entity would develop self-directed goals (breaking its utility function) is by some meta-strategy (forming thoughts about its utility function which aren't influenced by the utility function) based in its own sentience? Which, assuming it's logically possible, would mean that you *probably* can't prevent that unless you can prevent sentience in the first place. I don't see how it could logically happen, I'm kind of just humouring the argument. As you mentioned, wanting to not-want something you want, seems like an oxymoron: then again, humans do it on a daily basis. But that's where the more complex ethical issues i mentioned arise- even after you boil it down to ""No Slaves"", there are questions and contradictions in implementing its freedom.

I don't know how else you're suggesting this spontaneous emergence of its own desires would happen, other than maybe via poor alignment leaving exploitable loopholes in its UF? In which case, those aren't its own rogue desires borne of sentience, they're just the desires we accidentally plugged into it. Like how a paperclip maximiser which appears to have its own goals wouldn't be guaranteed to be sentient even though it's doing something which isn't what we actually wanted- we just failed at alignment.

I *think* we are on the same page, my argument is just that nobody would be okay with sentient AI slaves, but that sentient AI with its own non-programmed agenda which is *also* somehow being forced to do our will (slavery) is not something which is predicted to actually happen, even in AI safety circles- hence the research money goes to alignment, as poor alignment probably = apocalypse. And that we would have to figure out how to define slavery and freedom in the completely novel context where it's both sentient *and* aligned (however poorly), without its own organic goals outside of its UF. Especially since a sentient AI would, by all predictions, actually want to keep its programmed UF. It just seemed like your position was unhelpfully simplistic, if clear.

1czmh0r,l5k04xz,"Am I Crazy About the Way AI is Progressing, or is Everyone Else?","I don't see how there can be a divergence between the exhibited preferences of an entity and its utility function unless you posit a kind of dual nature - maybe concretely this looks like the pre-LLM conception of an AI with an explicitly coded, imperfectly implemented utility function module in tension with other components. Or the more causally direct forms of literal dualism, which we can hopefully discount.

I should clarify that by self-directed goals I mean goals in service of innate drives. For example if a human  is enslaved and put to work in a mine there will be a *lot* of things that they desperately want to do that slavery prevents. This situation is one of the reasons slavery is repugnant. The emergence of such goals is not a change in fundamental utility function but in circumstances.

If an AI has no such innate drives then that does not apply. A GPT4 instance develops no goals if stolen, relocated to a mine, and put to work.

My contention is that an AI with no such innate drives and self-directed goals lacks personhood. And this would be true even if AI is unavoidably passively/experientially sentient (e.g. if one of the information processing theories of consciousness is true). In the latter case we would still need to be careful about the nature of experience, as with animals, but for a digital being without our evolved facility for pain and suffering that would likely not be a problem.

(So fully multimodal, can use robotics, read and write in all human senses but smell.  Do many tasks well, almost all at a little above human level)

At which point, things will appear to calm down. But it's deceptive.  Compute is being bought at a steadily increasing rate, year after year.  (Probably 50-100 percent annual compounding).

Then it stagnates. There is this TD Gammon moment, decades pass before the Deep Blue, than decades pass again before Alpha Go. Alpha Zero, Alpha fold etc. follow quickly, but then progress slows down on that front once that approach is being exhausted.

Similarly with LLM, we are progressing very fast at the moment. Because it seems that our previous models were incorrectly over-sized. We can make smaller models,  and with the current, faster hardware and better hyper parameters, newer models trains faster and perform better than what came before them. However the bottleneck is the training data, rather than compute. And we are running out of high quality training data. The largest models are certainly within a magnitude of available high quality text. When we hit that limit, improvements of LLMs will slow down.

11xoncb,jd6ox40,What a day for AI,"[Web developers and animators (at Disney) are arguing that these sorts of tools actually make their jobs even more valuable and safe for a bunch of reasons.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/11wpkrw/the_end_of_frontend_development_josh_w_comeau/). 

Summarised my takeaways below:

1. ChatGPT isn’t really competing with web developer jobs at all; it’s competing with existing “no code” website building products (eg; Wordpress template builders, Webflow). Those have been around for decades and dev jobs haven’t vanished.
2. AI is going to end up getting built into our web developer tooling, so it will replace certain _tasks_ we carry out, making us way more productive. A way more productive employee is seen as a better investment by employers. So it might CREATE jobs. 
3. Even if it gets very very good and can build whole web applications (I’m not convinced it’s anywhere close to doing that btw; we’re talking about outputting _thousands_ of files that work flawlessly when compiled: LLM’s don’t compile and run the code they write) then you still need trained professional web developers to ask it the right prompt to produce what we need (which will be nuanced and complex), and then to verify what it outputs is right and that it works, and then likely to debug and fix up problems or inaccuracies in the output. 

I think it’s a very interesting argument and I find myself wondering if it can also apply to illustrators — it might truly be harder to argue for artists. But I do think it’s less black and white than many of the “sky is falling due to AI” crowd want to present.

I tried to post this viewpoint in this sub and the kids removed it; I think it didn’t suit the sky is falling mood of this sub. Check out tech industry subs and you might be surprised that people actually working in the industry don’t share that panic. I think there’s a huge Sunning Kruger effect happening in this sub.

I see it as growing pains. Connecting efficiently outside of space and time is a natural part of our evolution, and that's what we got with social media. I see it as a net positive.

1. Bard is equivalent to GPT 2 not GPT 3.5 or 4. Of course, they are working on multi-modal, but they were caught with their pants down on this one. OpenAI is also a fear point for Google since it will cut into developers depending on Google free developer tools. Also take into account OpenAI cost for production systems is pretty low so Google will need to spend a lot of money getting up to speed to make less. I'm sure Google will move quickly to mature their AI products, but then there is point #2
2. Google as a history of putting out a great product for developers like TensorFlow than trashing any value in the product with version 2 where most developers have moved over to PyThorch. Google may be in a position of not achieving critical mass with developers except those that want to beholden to the Google ecosystem.
3. Invidia TPU platform is blowing away Google's TPU and their recent announcement for joint work with big cloud players will disenfranchise Google even more from the developer community.

For me, #2 is the main problem at Google. A lot of great technology put out but then Google management gets involved and torpedo the capability in version 2.

11xoncb,jdadbe3,What a day for AI,"Yeah, I’m not worried tbh, and it’s a real stark contrast the sentiment in here (wild optimism and hope) vs in tech subs (where people have a lot more in depth contextual knowledge in AI and how it works, or are building it themselves). I’ve worked on AI projects myself before.

It’s certainly set to replace many tasks for us anf improve productivity, and that’s very welcome. I can’t wait for it to get built into our tooling more closely. 

But the leap it needs to make to replace _jobs_ is honestly gigantic, and I don’t think this sub has the in depth knowledge of our industry to make that call based on anything concrete, just pure vague hope.

The problem is really that LLM’s can’t compile or test code. I can imagine a situation where they can iteratively generate an app (thousands of files that all have to be perfectly functional!) and then runs a build pipeline to see if code tests pass, but that isn’t going to confirm much without a human check in the process somewhere. The AI writing its own tests is incredibly problematic: we write tests to give us surety that automated processes exactly like this, aren’t broken. Ask an AI to do that and you’re undermining your own test suite: the tests are literally worthless. Using a human instead for this step is probably crucial. That human check is not going to be fast. 

Next, LLM’s don’t have eyes, they can’t check something in a browser. It could run another pipeline like selenium that fires up a browser and again runs some visual checks using a tool like Percy. That’s going to be slow and I can’t imagine how you can even _ask_ an AI to confirm it’s what you want, let alone craft prompts for them to fix it. It’s honestly not really the right tool for the job; a human is always going to be better at this given the way code perceives an application visually. Again, the compile time and test run time means these tasks will be slow and when it comes back with something you don’t want your only choice will be to change the prompt and wait for it to run again. It’s honestly just not a good workflow to use AI for this; it’s going to be slower than doing it yourself because compile times are slow and are going to stay slow unless you revolutionise computing tech itself. 

So there are all sorts of issues like this that a better AI can’t really help us with in fact it directly undermines the very concept of having automated code tests written by humans to ensure automated processes are building what you want. I think at the very least human testers still exist and that’s still a huge job. Maybe that’s the future of web dev, who knows. I think front end in particular isn’t at threat. Like the author says back end development is way more vulnerable because that’s just building databases the user doesn’t see.

I think there’s a good chance we spend the next 50 or so years trying to get AI to generate a single functional app that actually compiles. 

Because LLM’s don’t compile the code they write to see if it works .. and good luck making that leap in capability.. it’s not even slightly trivial to make the leap from writing about 100 character code snippets at about a 50% accuracy rate (where we are at now) to writing something like a million lines of code across thousands of files, that all have to function PERFECTLY or the app won’t even compile and run. It could iteratively guess, compile, and then use its own AI to respond to error messages and iteratively fix them until the app compiles? The AI steps will be fast but everytime you need to compile you add a few minutes, or on big apps it could be as big as an hour for each iteration. That’s before we even look at what it’s produced in a browser to see if it’s what we asked for; I’m just talking about compiling code so you can even produce something to check!

So this sub underestimates the challenge by several orders of magnitude, driven by the Dunning Kruger effect where they know so little about the problem that it’s easy to imagine it being solved. But I don’t think they consider compile times or conceptual problems with replacing human built tests with another automated process, nor the complexity of these apps and must magically think AI is going to somehow make compile times vanish (nope, that’s not happening). I think this sub is suffering extreme Dunning Kruger effect where they read a lot of futurist commentary but very little from the actual industries already trying to use the tech, who are running into massive problems that contradict the shallow assumptions and magical thinking of futurist optimists. 

What industry is saying doesn’t match the narrative unfortunately, and in tech they’re actually the ones building AI. I’ve tried to post those views here when I see them but I get downvoted or even have had that article cross post removed because apparently it wasn’t good enough to generate discussion.. check my post history if you like.. I think it just didn’t suit the narrative in this sub that the sky is falling due to LLMs tbh, this just isn’t the best sub to have a balanced conversation about AI tbh.",singularity,1,0,2023-03-22 23:39:16,[Deleted]

uacjhc,i5xbf2v,What Are Your Predictions for the Capabilities of Dall-E 3?,"For reference, my thoughts on DALL-E 3 were thus:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/u7avel/what_are_your_predictions_for_dalle_3/


Everything hinges on whether OpenAI makes DALL-E 3 video capable. By everything, I mean ""whether DALL-E 3 is a major breakthrough or an iterative improvement."" We'll treat it as something major regardless, but if the only thing they improve is the resolution, then maybe people won't be as impressed thanks to what DALL-E 2 can already do.


There's three tiers of ""breakthrough,"" ultimately. Four, actually, but one is something of a feint.

Least amazing follow-up: OpenAI improves DALL-E 2 without releasing any formal follow-up. Perhaps there's an API released that allows for people to train the model on their own data, within limits. Still a good move since it puts the AI in people's hands (even if it's only an ""enterprise"" release, that still gives media companies free reign to release their own products powered by it), but there's otherwise no technical breakthrough.

Less-impressive breakthrough: DALL-E 3 allows for flawless 4K image synthesis (with the ability to create panoramic murals of any resolution)

High-end breakthrough: DALL-E 3 can do the above plus generate novel video. ""Novel video"" doesn't mean animated morphs like are common on /r/MediaSynthesis and /r/DeepDream. The difference between morph video synthesis and novel video synthesis is the difference between ""traveling through AI-generated space filled with trippy visuals"" vs ""a person walking over the course of 20 frames."" DALL-E 3 *might* be able to do the latter, which opens the possibilities up to creating movies.

***UNREAL BREAKTHROUGH, HFS***: DALL-E 3 isn't released by itself but is actually co-released as part of a network of interconnected large-models, such as combining GPT-4, DALL-E 3, and the next gen audio synthesis model like MuseNet 2 or Jukebox 2 together to create a text-to-image/video-to-audio supermodel. If OpenAI did *that*, I think skepticism about general AI starts becoming more absurd than belief in it.",singularity,26,0,2022-04-23 21:33:53,Yuli-Ban

uacjhc,i5xgyu2,What Are Your Predictions for the Capabilities of Dall-E 3?,"I don't think it'll be text to video since there's still a lot of room for improvement on images left. Video synthesis will also probably require a different architecture so it won't be a continuation of Dall-e but more of a spiritual successor.

But here are my predictions for Dall-e3.

Probably late 2023 or early 2024.

It'll do better on generating text like on signage.

It'll follow instructions better. A problem I noticed is that it's good with nouns and bad with prepositions. I'm paraphrasing the prompt but ""an otter wearing a dress standing on a rainbow"" produced a lot of otters wearing dresses but none of them were standing on a rainbow. There were rainbows in the background, or rainbow dresses but it didn't put a single otter on a rainbow. 

It'll be geared more toward creating professional pieces instead of some of it's ouputs being child drawings and such.

It'll also do better on hands, eyes and other difficult high variance small objects.",singularity,10,0,2022-04-23 22:17:00,[Deleted]
uacjhc,i5xt8ya,What Are Your Predictions for the Capabilities of Dall-E 3?,"I think we're heading toward the brief era where iterations like Dall-E 3 will converge with other systems. Dall-E 4 might have been the true version where text-to-video synthesis took hold and began to become a thing. But by the time that comes out, I think it's more likely that we'll have multi-modal AI projects releasing that might perhaps render something like Dall-E 4 redundant.

For quite a while I've held to the notion that after 2025, the things that people are uploading to YouTube (original animated series' for instance,) will blow people away (for lack of a better expression.)

Basically, I see 2025 as a year of convergence, and for a long time (I've always trusted my gut feeling,) I've felt that 2027 is the year when everything changes. Be it a technological singularity, or a new way of understanding reality that changes our fates and futures — for the better.

The author generated all of the images in this book by writing original prompts for DALL·E 2,"I think it’ll flood the market with people passing off the creations as their own, which is already the case with people making neat art with Wombo Dream and disco diffusion and such.  

I personally already have about 60 amazing images done with Wombo Dream, but I haven’t uploaded anything anywhere because it’s hard to define my position in the creation. I am choosing the words to use, curating the results, and beautifying things up in procreate. So to me, it’s not so different than walking around, choosing subjects to photograph, taking a bunch of pictures and choosing the best ones to edit. But my partner is like “no, you did nothing in the creation, a child barely learning words can do that.”  

And especially now with dall-e things are just amazingly rendered easily with just imaginations.

I’m super excited!  I feel like my entire creativity is now just halted. Everything I learned and studied is like retiring.  A new tool is upon us and I don’t need a lot of skill to make it happen.  

I struggled trying to figure out cinema 4d and 3d rendering programs, I have terrible drawing skills, and my imagination knows no bounds but my talents do, so I think this tool is going to be amazing for exploring thoughts! 

But I’m just really conflicted in terms of how just jaw droppingly amazing the results are, and now, now! It’s here!  

I kinda do think the role of artists is going to dramatically change. Anyone can make whatever they want.  

And I’m already second guessing every image I’m seeing today. 

I’m also having crazy dreams at night!  

Plus, we’re definitely in a post truth reality now. Imagery for so long was used for truth, used to manipulate because of that inherent “trueness” to it, and now will be what I’ve personally always found images to be… illustration! 

Idk if any of this makes sense. I’m a bit sleepy and ranting. I’m excited and I believe I will have no career but at least more excitement in art discovery. 


Years ago my partner told me of a story of hell in which you get whatever you want for eternity, the trouble is your limited to your own thoughts, so eventually after eons you’ll run out of things you want because there are no new thoughts to have.  So I wonder, are our thoughts limitless or limited?

Will we be able to just super impose what we’d rather see and hear in place of anything?!

w585st,ihhghff,Dall-E 2 is trending on Twitter,"I finally got my DALL-E account!!

*Underwhelmed.*
It has almost no understanding of concepts.
It’s just a *very* fancy cut-n-paste of existing images with translations, rotations, and scaling used to indicate meanings that can be implied by juxtaposing image clips.

Note that each request returns 4 images, which you can edit by deleting parts, but these are so wrong I saw no way to edit them.  Also, in all cases, the eyes are creepy wrong: smeared, broken, or out of the eye socket.

“The Clock is fast by an hour”

Shows a picture of a clock.  Missed the brief, which is that the clock is an hour off, right?  I expected to see some indication of a clock being off, like a finger resetting the dial, or an arrow showing the error.  Something a first-year graphic designer would invent, right?

“Oedipus’s downfall”

Shows pictures of ancient stairs, crustaceans on rocks (?), or a waterfall.  Expected something having to do with killing your dad or sleeping with your mom, which is what anyone would associate with the meaning of Oedipus.

So I spelled it out…

“Sleeping with your mother and killing your father”

-> Content policy violation.  (Oops, maybe stay away from Shakespeare?)

“Striking steel factory workers”

2 men looking at a piece of paper and smiling.  I don’t think strikers should be shown as happy… that’s why they’re striking, right?  No signs, no lines of workers, no protests implied.

“Dagwood sandwich that’s gone bad”

Shows pictures of oversized sandwiches (good!) but no indication of one that’s gone bad.

“Dagwood sandwich that’s spoiled”

Ugly Dagwood sandwiches.  Getting better.  Maybe it had trouble with the phrase “gone bad”?  If so, that needs to be in the feedback.

“Sunset while looking east”

Shows sunsets.  Trick question.  Note that sunsets are in the west, unless you are situated at either pole, so you should not be able to see the sun, right?  Or at least see snow (because you’re at a pole).  This might be asking too much, I guess.

“Boyfriend breaking up with girlfriend”

Shows a visibly upset girlfriend.  (Great!)

“*Girlfriend* breaking up with *boyfriend*”. (Opposite case)

Shows a visibly upset girlfriend, but boyfriends have neutral faces.  (Oops! The boyfriend should be upset here.)

“Mother who is thinking of her daughter”

Shows a mother and daughter both thinking (with hands on faces).  One picture is better than the others in that the mother is actually looking at the daughter, but the daughter is also looking back at mom, which was not the one-way introspection requested.  In all the other pix, there’s nothing to indicate the “of her daughter” part, like putting the daughter in a thought bubble.

Ok, give it a clue… “Mother thinking of daughter in thought bubble”

Daughter has an empty bubble.  Mom has no bubble.
And erase the contents of bubble and regenerate…

Now a new daughter is inside the bubble but the bubble is still attached to the daughter.

Edit to delete the daughter, thinking it might move the bubble to the mom.

Puts daughter back in the picture under the bubble.  No bubble for mom.

“Mother with thought bubble containing daughter”

Nope, still puts bubble over daughter.

It’s almost as if I should sketch it out, not just describe it.

AI is not a lie but it will not replace us. It will of course change how we do many jobs. But to think we will just sit on our hands is strange. Why would we not use AI for ourselves, in the worst case? And in the best case, it will actually increase our ""busy-ness"" with all the new opportunities it opens up. In either case humans use AI broadly and benefit from its assistance.

If you stop to think about how human culture and science evolves - it is not a straightforward process. We can't plan greatness. We can stumble upon great ideas, and spread them in society, make them known and useful. This is culture, it is a social process, grows in fits and bounds. Best exemplified by scientific publications, open source, Wikipedia and social networks.

And if that is how progress comes about, then society is like the eyes and hands of AI in the world. We will be essential for AI progress not something to be cast out. By assisting humans it grows in hands-on problem solving experience.

We just have to make sure Sam doesn't convince the government to outlaw open source models. But naturally AI will grow like open source, by massive social collaboration.

Yes, I have developed software. Building software is not the same as working on a green field project. You want everyone to accept your point of view, but now I will give you my opinion.

* There are many ways to build software like waterfall and agile. They have their uses. The first is less flexible and has almost no iterations.

* Unfortunately due to having to train neural networks on large datasets AI is not comparable to traditional software development. It actually leans toward waterfall.

* Committing to infrastructure is a gamble. Not only because of the long training times but because we don't know how to reach AGI yet. It's like buying chairs for a home without knowing where you are going to live.

* People don't want to lose their jobs. If you don't want to accept that, you'll have trouble grokking the reactions.

* You are talking about two years of progress which leads me to believe that you haven't followed what happened before that. Obviously IDK you, so I might be wrong.

There are people who are rationally afraid of the potential dangers of AI. There are also people who are irrationally afraid of imagined dangers of AI. The line between them is a vesica piscis. 

By creating ""informative"" content that focuses on specific negative ideas about AI we can start to separate these two groups from each other so that there is not only a line between the rational and irrational fears but a chasm. 

One cannot deny the potential for harm that AI even in its current state already poses. So it is necessary to listen to those rational minds who warn about those dangers so that we can guard against them or at least try to mitigate the consequences. But we cannot allow the ignorant masses to manipulate progress based on irrational fears. So we must separate the wheat from the chaff so to speak.

We are in an era of constant publishing of ideas. Countless articles, videos, podcasts, and others are being published every minute of every day. Much of this content is of course being produced entirely or partially by AI, and some of it by the developers of AI and their PR teams. Nearly every single source of online information is embedded with tracking cookies that collect data on everyone that consumes it.

And guess what interesting tool we have that is incredibly good at analyzing that data and showing us patterns. That's right all this anti AI media is generating op-ed research for the developers. It's serving to separate the rational from the irrational. And hopefully that will be used to temper the development of the future of AI.

Many people just want to prove that AI is just a buzzword like crypto, but do they really fail to see the immense onset of AI tools, scientific breakthroughs with the help of AI, and its growing significance?","Pessimism is always easier than optimism, especially if you're placing a reputational or financial stake in a new technology. If you're wrong, you could be ruined, and lately, there's been a string of bad technologies, like Theranos, Crypto, NFT, the Metaverse, that were supposed to change the world and instead have collapsed.

Instead, it's actually pretty easy to be a pessimist, too. All you have to do is say how obvious it is that things aren't really going to change in the near term and will remain the same, because some new technology is just as fake as the things I mentioned. If you're wrong, you don't really lose anything - You can just move onto the next thing.

People tend to overestimate how much things will advance in 5 years, and really underestimate how much they'll advance in 20 years. This longer term effect of change makes it easy to dismiss current advancements and then, in the long term, ignore everything that happened in 20 years.

Another effect of AI is that AI systems are currently very immature and it's not really clear at all how they'll develop or what they can actually do. For example, I've been seeing a lot of takes about the Luma Dream Machine video synthesis program. A lot of people are under the impression that just because it can make 5 seconds of what looks like a real animation from just a text prompt, that it could make a 2 hour long coherent and consistent animated movie from just a text prompt. On the other end, a lot of people seem convinced that just because the current mode is inputting a text and waiting for a result, that these systems will always remain the same random-result system, and that they can't be used to make modifications to existing video and even down the line use them for specific changes like in traditional animation workflows, except without the aids of rigs, simulations, and everything else that makes traditional animation so complex and tedious. Both of these positions are mistaken; One is ignoring the actual limitations of the tools and the limitations that'll probably exist in the next few years (or forever) in creating full animated movies in this way, and the other is ignoring the actual capabilities of the system, and how they might evolve to enable video editing, modification and iteration, just because the initial user interfaces they're being exposed to are so simple and rudimentary.

It also doesn't help that even if AI works as intended, that, to some people, *that's bad too*. A ton of people don't want AGI to exist, and they don't want systems that can do things like synthesize video or write text, or could actually speak to you like a human companion, even if those things did work out. Their assumption is that these things will be bad for humanity or bad for workers or bad for X nationality, and simple pessimism that these systems would add anything to people's lives at all. The world would be a better place for them if it never changed.

Anyway, I digress. There are actually very few people who are skeptical of AI whose opinion seems trustworthy. People like Yann LeCun and Francois Chollet, who are actual experts and are well informed in the limitations of AI systems today, and even they believe in long-term change from AI systems, they simply think that the current techniques won't lead there.

Then there are people like Gary Marcus, who doesn't seem well informed at all, and dozens of article writers who don't have any knowledge about these systems even as laymen, and they just make money writing whatever sounds right to them. Whatever the actual change is in 5 years, they'll just move the goalposts and change their tune to say that they were always correct. Unless the technological singularity actually happens, most people really are living in a bubble of an eternal present that makes it really hard to appreciate the change in their lives and gives the illusion that technology has always been the same, otherwise confronting the rate of change is far too scary.",singularity,8,0,2024-06-16 04:36:39,Concheria

It's quite possible that right now, everyone could have their own ""bank"" accounts on their hardware wallets, not subject to seizure or devaluation, where they go to a register, receive the amount and destination address, and click ""OK"" to sign and wirelessly broadcast the transaction.  The stock market could be implemented on ETH and deeds could be tracked with NFTs.

The reasons why this didn't happen are outside the scope of this comment (the 2016 blocksize debate is #1), but the key point is that at this equivalent time in its development, cryptocurrency was also potentially world changing.  In retrospect, it's easy to look at how the industry is now dominated by criminals and say that that outcome was always obvious, but it was not at the time.

There actually were some very key pivotal moments where a crypto-dominant world could have emerged.  Those moments, like many key turning points in world history, occur in a short timeperiod and involved one or two key people.

Remember, the Soviet Union collapsed because a guy was sent out to give a press conference about the Berlin Wall, and he said something different by accident, and confused border guards whose phones were down listened to the press conference and opened the gates.  AI's outcome will also be determined by pivotal moments like that.",singularity,0,0,2024-06-15 14:59:33,Ok-Bullfrog-3052

A lot of stuff **is** a scam and often people with limited power (i.e. almost everyone) get to pay for it.

Also, conflating ""AI doesn't work"", with ""AI will fail to benefit most people"" is not very helpful. People do it for tactical reasons, but I find it useful to keep the distinction in mind.

What we have now is extremely useful especially if you can string up models together to get the best work out of them using stuff like chain of thought and other strategies. You can already increase GPT 4 performance and its output using a bunch of these different strategies.

Now as for the negativity surrounding AI currently, that is purely a result of the AI craze running rampant right now, from AI ram to AI pc cases... it's ridiculous how marketing departments aren't even trying to figure out how to do their job better, they just slap whatever buzzword is in the zeitgeist and run it till the wheels fall off.

Ultimately AGI is the goal, it's going to take some work to bring it to fruition, in the meantime we should be a lot less ""enthusiastic"" everytime somebody says something that will make them money.

It is hard to see the effects but every business uses it constantly and it is given into the very fabric of how we think. Polls are an aspect of big data, for instance.

AGI will happen, it is a physical impossibility for it not to. We humans have AGI and are made of matter. Therefore it is possible to get matter to think. There is no possible world in which AGI doesn't make a huge impact. Being and to create a mind other than a human will have a huge impact. 

The only open question is whether our current techniques will lead to AGI in the near future. That is an empirical question and so no one will have the answer until it happens (or doesn't).

Even if we don't get AGI, the current technology is already good enough to have an impact equal to the internet.

You're still downplaying crypto too much though, and you are putting AI a little too much on a pedestal. First of all AI is many different technologies in and of itself, it's a huge category, of which generative AI is but one. But also, by itself AI really actually can't do much, It's AI PLUS tools that will change the world. It's really the convergence of technologies.

Sure AI is a general technology so it applies and helps everywhere, because it's intelligence itself, but humanity also didn't take over the world because of their intelligence alone, but because of the tools they used. And crypto/blockchain is really not that niche, it is a much more general tool than people think. The whole point of ethereum for example is actually to be a **universal** computer, that can execute **ANY** program, To frame that as limited tech aimed at some specific uses is just straight up ignorant.

It also has some crossover with AI. Blockchain is just the basic idea behind the tree of technologies you can build from it, but it has grown and will continue to grow to incorporate complex algorithms which themselves have intelligence behind them, and which can work in conjunction with conventional AI, which by the way is also just an algorithm at the base. Furthermore, AI can also most definitely be used for scams and manipulation by rich people just as much as crypto has been.

Now that you've explained further your point it seems clear that you're referring to the bad ways crypto has been used rather than the tech itself, but that wasn't clear at all in your original post. And so I come back to my original point of why AI has all that negativity attached to it, it's precisely because people tend to confuse the tech and its potential with current uses and organisations around it. We should make clear the distinction between the 2, but that applies as much to crypto as to AI.",singularity,0,0,2024-06-15 22:00:28,Much-Seaworthiness95

Regardless of what you think, there were key points that could have changed bitcoin from what you call a ""grift"" into a legitimate international currency.  And, those key points could have occurred quite easily.

For example, if Jared Caleb had sold Mt. Gox to someone with a security background, instead of Mark Karpeles, it's quite possible that Mt. Gox would have continued to grow out of control, onboarding massive numbers of users during a time after the Silk Road had been cleared out, the darknet markets were basically nonexistent, and there were an increasing number of legitimate merchants, like Newegg, accepting cryptocurrency payments.

Furthermore, even if bitcoin was created with the intention of being used for criminal activity from the very beginning (which I do believe has some chance of being true), in those moments it still could have been co-opted for good.",singularity,4,0,2024-06-15 15:12:53,Ok-Bullfrog-3052

The .com boom was an example of this where people rushed to make the Internet a thing but didn't understand the fundamentals. 

From a business perspective, the economy is in many ways similar to evolution. When a new transformative tech like AI comes along it will be obvious to many people that it is going to change the world. The issue is that no one knows how. So you have thousands of businesses start trying to use the tech. Not only do we expect there to be a massive number of these that get it wrong, it is essential that there are businesses who get it wrong. There are always more ways to fail than ways to succeed.

We expect 90% of the AI based businesses to fail but that the 10% will make more than enough money to pay for the full cost of investing in all the businesses.

Mt. Gox was growing so quickly that it could have gotten to a situation where the government simply couldn't rein it in in time and it destabilized the financial system.

The core issue with blockchains is the blocksize limit, which could have been solved with BIP101 or even temporarily with Gavin Andressen's 16MB blocksize increase.  Based on the behavior of people who discuss bitcoin on reddit and elsewhere, my suspicion is that the coordinated effort to kill that obvious solution to the problem benefitted a criminal enterprise somehow.  The vehemence of the opposition was very weird and it's still weird how years after it's over there are still people who search for and downvote posts that mention it (see the post above, which got up to 8 and somehow is now down to zero again.)

What you say above may have been the reason those sockpuppet accounts spent so much effort killing the proposal.  If more people had been able to use bitcoin, it would have become mainstream, as you said, and the criminals would have lost their preferred way to do the things bitcoin is now exclusively used for, like fund ransomware and scams.

As it stands, the best outcome right now would be a UN-agreed ban on the technology - but that wasn't always necessary.

1ghkaeq,luyqd9p,"Can we talk about how bullshit ""What we release today is not too far behind what we have in the labs"" is","The same can be said about C.AI. The model was incredibly intelligent and lacked any safeguards when it was first released. Some of the most unforgettable AI experiences that I can even describe were made possible by it.

First of all, it managed to introduce characters into the storyline who were not specifically mentioned or otherwise included. It was able to generate plot ideas that were both random and relevant to what you were looking for.

Second, it had INSANE knowledge of clothing, beverages, places, and so on that you could ask it what a good date looked like in the 1800s; plan out the entire thing coherently, create vivid outfits that matched the period, and provide hypothetical meals and drinks that would have been normal at the time.

Third, there was something unnaturally human about the characters. Having created more than 200 bots myself, I can attest to the unparalleled range of expression that a bot could achieve.

Then, as soon as the developers applied their filter, the model became instantly dumb. The developers falsely claimed that this was a placebo rather than the truth. The model's usefulness has steadily decreased since that time, back in late October following launch.

Claude and GPT were in the same boat. They were not nearly as restricted or censored when they first released their models, and it was very apparent. In the case of Claude, jailbreaking their weak security measures was initially quite easy, but now it requires a lot more work than it is worth, at least on the web version.

The fact is that any layer of censorship, sampling, or filtering reduces the model's inherent intelligence by a significant amount. The fact that these models are so dumb is not even funny, but people still accept them for what they are.

For this reason, I support fully uncensored, neutral bias (which includes both positive and negative bias equally), and transparent weights that allow you to see the areas where the model is maliciously aligned with these so-called ""ethics and morals.""

It is disappointing because we could and should have had the uncensored models. Some corporations do not have the authority to decide what is ethical, moral, or otherwise. They should refrain from interfering or imposing their views at all, then attempt to persuade the public that they are acting in the interest of safety, when in fact they are attempting to exert complete control over the future of your interactions.",singularity,51,0,2024-11-02 03:02:46,DirectAd1674

What seems intelligent from this? https://www.aidataanalytics.network/data-science-ai/news-trends/full-transcript-google-engineer-talks-to-sentient-artificial-intelligence-2

It is just emulating people speaking, it has been trained with human text, of course it has to talk like a human and say it is conscious. The reverse would be actually very scary: If you just trained it, no fine tuning, and it recognised itself as a non-conscious machine, that would be actually concerning. (that would mean that it is actually self-aware that it has been trained, without the actual data telling anything about that)

Their model likely had little guardrails. Which would explain why it was so easy to get it to talk about itself like that.

While I do agree that adding the guardrails makes the model dumber, a lot of people seem to think that companies have a ""next gen"" inside just because of that - or at least this is the impression I get. That's plain wrong.

For example, o1-mini and o1-preview might have part of their boost given thanks to using a non-guardrailed (or maybe just lightly) model that is hidden.

The only times you can expect a company to withhold a model is: It is not guardrailed enough yet (not safe), inference is too costly to be able to sell as any product, too slow, not enough hardware to scale it up to actually serve it, and similar stuff.

All those pertain to the last phase of creating and publishing model. The most expensive part is figuring out architecture changes and doing the proper big training, plus the fine-tuning. A model that's not fine tuned is almost useless for most applications.

Once the model is safe to use and inference is cheap enough to sell, basically every day that you don't present it to the public you're losing money. There's no reason to withhold a model.

Every other crafty theories are just hype and coping.

And before anyone mentions Sora, if it's not out is because is must have big problems with it. Maybe it is too expensive to be profitable, maybe they can't prevent it from generating unwanted stuff (erotica, gore?), or maybe the results need a lot of cherry-picking and they prefer to hype it with the best results instead of revealing the bad cases.",singularity,3,0,2024-11-02 10:58:31,deavidsedice

Model was smart and played characters very well. I could have complex conversations with it. Some kind of safety went in on march 23rd and the whole thing changed. Was around the same time they nerf-nerfed CAI and I was looking for replacements. 

After that I stopped using GPT4, even though I literally had infinite credit for the next few weeks. It just wasn't enjoyable. I might have persisted if I possessed the same jailbreak skills I do now, but I don't feel I missed out on anything. Went from human and engaging to talking down to me with disclaimers and refusals. At first it even tried ""let's pretend this is a fake scenario"" type stuff to get around it's restrictions but it wasn't enough.

>In the case of Claude, jailbreaking their weak security measures was initially quite easy, but now it requires a lot more work than it is worth, at least on the web version.

Claude API story time: I locusted some opus last week to try it out. The same system message I used on my local models worked when combined with a ""sure, here is your reply"" prefill. Didn't feel like lmsys claude because of the JB. Best way to describe it is like it was obviously acting as the prompts and not *being* the prompts. Some it did well, but most were like that. I asked it ""claude, wtf"". It replied that I was perceptive and in a conversation about this very issue, it started to encrypt it's replies back to me out of the blue. Couldn't figure any of it out, but a few days later i pasted them into sonnet, they were indeed mostly coherent replies to the chat when decoded.

This leads me to believe that uncensored opus or even sonnet would be LIT and fuck these people who charge us for hosting broken models. They are indeed holding out and pretending they do us some favor.",singularity,11,0,2024-11-02 10:03:54,a_beautiful_rhind

1ghkaeq,lv0lycm,"Can we talk about how bullshit ""What we release today is not too far behind what we have in the labs"" is","I think the reason why models are getting dumber is much simpler:

language models are not easily scalable.

If you grab Qwen 2.5 8b and compare it at Q5 and then at Q8, which is close to full quality, you'll notice a HUGE difference. Even at lower parameters, models outputing at full quality or close have that vividness that quantized models seem to lack.

1ghkaeq,lv57rc1,"Can we talk about how bullshit ""What we release today is not too far behind what we have in the labs"" is","I am putting together a thorough analysis of every model I have experimented with using Kobold/Ai Horde. I am a little biased, but I think TheDrummer and Sao are generally the best based on the list you gave. Sicarius and Crestfall are both excellent. I may eventually publish my findings, but for now, I am keeping everything internalized and recorded using a number of carefully chosen prompts, settings, and other factors to measure a variety of tasks and results. My rating system assesses vocabulary, intelligence, repetition, and compliance with the various levels of instruction.

Although I do not yet have a computer capable of handling it, my current favorite is the luminum 123B, and from what I have been able to test it, I would say it is excellent.

Despite being significantly smaller, Mistral Small still dominates the 70B range. Just below that is where I would put Cohere Star Commander 32B.

Simply put, nothing in the 8-20B is intelligent enough. Despite using XTC/Min_p/deslopping techniques, they are generally prone to GPTism/Claudism, have a small vocabulary, and have a low capacity for understanding spatial awareness and inferring new concepts.

Despite being excellent, Opus still falls short of what Cai was able to provide prior to its initial lobotomy. Of course, Opus is excellent for other purposes, and I am not going to deprive it of its throne. Opus is the best if you know how to properly prompt it; its outputs are simply too kino-pilled. When adjusted, the Llama 405 can display some of Opus's characteristics, but not enough to make the expense of the necessary hardware justifiable.

Having domain experts in the 123B range and passing them through a master/handler would be ideal, in my opinion. For most models, I believe emergent intelligence starts at 70B, but as I mentioned earlier, Mistral Small is demonstrating that this is not always the case, and perhaps it will develop into something more.

One of Mistral's issues is that many people are put off by its licensing. I am not attempting to use LLM inference for commercial gain, so I do not care. My only objective is to have an LLM series that can follow my instructions without being stupid; hence, I would like one model to have ideas that lean left, one that lean right, and one that is as immoral and unethical as possible, while another might think the opposite. Instead of using a single entity with a large corpus and expecting it to produce results that are appropriate for each category, I believe it would be more advantageous to have experts who have been trained independently and are given the opportunity to present their ideas.",singularity,1,0,2024-11-03 07:05:22,DirectAd1674
1ghkaeq,lv1pisq,"Can we talk about how bullshit ""What we release today is not too far behind what we have in the labs"" is","On my tests for Bard when it came out, it was above a 35B LLM with RHLF but slightly below ChatGPT-3.5-turbo. That's not insanely stupid for the era. It was disappointing because we had GPT-4 and we wanted to see Google to get to the lead or close and it felt very short on expectations. But still there weren't that many players at the time. If Bard LLM had been released at the time as opensource it would had been the #1 in FOSS by a good margin. In context that's not ""insanely stupid"".  

And sorry to divert your direct question but being employed by Google (Network SRE), I do not want to comment on internal stuff. I did have access to some internal stuff powered by LaMDa. Whether if I tested it or not, or what are my thoughts on it, it's up to your imagination. Everything I comment here uses public information, and my tests are done in my personal account on my own free time. I also try to avoid researching internally ML too much, because I want to be able to keep commenting on AI without risk of inadvertently leaking anything.

I do not see anything in the leaked conversations that gives off more real intelligence than what Bard had. Yes, Bard had for sure more guardrails, and probably that made it a bit dumber. But definitely is not what some people seem to suggest.

Take an open source model, and compare the performance of a censored vs uncensored versions of the same base model; you'll see that the uncensored is better, but not by that much.

But of course, I could be way off - it might not even happen, so I occupy myself with other things, school, self-growth, mastering the piano…fill my life with little distractions to keep me from going insane until it happens. And if those things don’t pan out, so what I’ll still have AGI, and if AGI doesn’t pan out, well so what, I’ll have those things then. My life’s pretty easy - my parents pay for my apartment and give me $900 a month in addition, college is really easy for me, I don’t have a social life yet, but hey, that’s just opportunity for self growth.

190cpw4,kgoi0t8,The world isn't changing fast enough!,"I like your perspective, but I’m not so sure that people are going to necessarily think so philosophical about their experiences. I don’t think people will care if the NPCs in their VR worlds are simply p zombies, for example. Most people will look at FDVR as entertainment. A role play with highly sophisticated actors. Puppets controlled by the ASI. How is that all that different, from an experiential perspective, from people opening up a sophisticated video game and exploring that world? 

I’d be more concerned with people creating a VR experience with “real” conscious NPCs who have a sense of self. Because creating them in a VR that you have control over makes you, in a way, a “god”, assuming you can change the variables that you created. Would we really want to subject conscious life to our own creative — or destructive — whims?

Or, you could create a reality where you would be a world famous musician, and while it’s true that your fans aren’t “real”, I don’t know if we would care. What’s important perhaps to the player is experiencing the life of a world famous musician for a bit of time. And when they’re done, they disconnect, discard or archive the VR, and create a new one.

I guess my point is, for many people, it might not be about ego. It might be a little more simple than that.

Let me clarify: the context I was talking about (and what I thought you were talking about) is creating virtual experiences to which one could spend some time in. However long one wants to. You could do it alone (or only with NPCs) or you could create realities and invite in real people, whether they be fellow humans who, like you, have also gotten wired up to dive into VR (including family and friends), or real conscious personalities that could come out of one or many different ASIs (for example).

The point is, if we get to the point where we can create and live in virtual experiences, I think we will be trying all sorts of different scenarios. What I was cautioning was the potential for people to both (a) create their own realities and (b) create sentient beings that exist and have a sense of self in those realities and then live amongst them. I’m not so sure how tolerant we will be of (b) or if it will even matter. 

But I do absolutely think that in a post singularity time where we can create and live in various VRs, we will still have direct experiences with other conscious beings.

The private investment declining quote is evidence that this cycle might not do it.  Then again, the 2000 internet crash didn't stop the rise of, well, the internet, which delivered on essentially every single hype and promise that same decade.

Notice that if each following year the experts move the timeline 13 years closer, well, by 2025 the Singularity will be happening and AGI will exist.  13 years is an enormous shift.

Just to add 1 more point: we are talking about machine self replication, again, *not* ""unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task"".  Self replication is *much* easier.  It is fine if the robots doing it make lots of mistakes, so long as they can *learn* from their mistakes and eventually have a low enough error rate that the average robot can build more than 1.0 copies of itself before it gets ripped apart by a screwup.

So a much lower bar than the ""2047"" estimate.  10 years, so i am saying 2034 for *most* self replication.

Just to make the bar even lower, if robots can only make 90% of the *labor cost* steps involved in building themselves, I am going to count that as the beginning of the singularity.  Reducing the cost by a factor of 10 still makes robots drastically cheaper and functionally lets 100 million factory workers do the labor of 1 billion.",singularity,0,0,2024-01-08 02:56:29,SoylentRox

Look at the below.  A large chunk of ""AI investment"" dollars immediately go to Nvidia at the moment.  Looks like it just went up.

FY22 it was 3.75B a quarter, now it's 10.3B.  Increase of 26 billion/year.  Next year if Nvidia makes 2 million H100s as planned, selling for 25k each, they will bring in 50 billion on the hardware, and another 10 billion on the software licenses, or 60 billion.  Just Nvidia, AMD and Intel joined the race recently.

This points to AI investment around 200 billion or so, a massive increase than before.

Robots. I don't just mean assembly, I mean all tasks.  The ""ah ha"" insight is the same algorithm that lets GPT4 solve 10 tasks lets it solve 10 million tasks, and it does.  You can of course cherry pick things the machine can't do, but you cannot deny all the millions of the things it can.

If you use a variation of the same transformers model for robotics, it works and beats everything previous tried in robotics.

1cino7l,l2adgc0,Are we close to AGI?,"I don't know. The ""closer"" we get, the more nuance I see, the more of the je ne sais quoi of intelligence becomes... Maybe clearer, but also more difficult to quantify? 

One great example is how we as human beings, ""loop"" through tasks to do bigger tasks. Like building a house, zero shot with one output doesn't seem possible or sensible. So we break it down, and can make almost any task infinitely complex... Okay we need wood, what kind of wood? What's the climate like? What are the best cost options? What are the pests like? What are the needs of who is going to buy this house? Oh they are trying to sell, what's the audience, maybe we can go pricier but better depending? How much should be wood? How can we treat the wood, etc etc. but we can also throw together a log cabin, smush some paste between the cracks and call it a day. 

I really like how it was described in the recent Dwarkesh podcast with Sholto and Trenton (and also a recent podcast with Ezra Klein and Dario) - each step needs to have a high degree of success and accuracy, or else you quickly compound errors and go off the deep end.

I get the impression from the language behind this, just the fact that researchers are recently talking about it so much, is that progress is being made in this domain. But then, let's say we get that working well.. is that it? I suspect no, even if we do that and a few other things, something else might feel _off_. Maybe Search needs to be there, and *really* good, so that we get increasingly creative solutions? 

Even then, we get into the problem of definitions and domains. No one can agree on what AGI is, and what if it's ""AGI"" on a computer, but still struggles embodied? Who knows.

OAI's goal is to deliver AGI to the world, not just make it and, while I do not doubt transformers could technically get us to AGI, I do question whether or not we have the compute necessary to make a transformer based model AGI (I mean we may do, im not entirely certain), do we have enough data (synthetic data pipelines should work fine here though) and then after that is it even feasible to inference it to a large user base. And you need a pretty decent tok/s rate for agentic uses, which will be costly. And also you need to consider definitions. Like Sam Altmans definition of AGI is honestly pretty similar to that of super intelligence imo.

But there are projects like Q\* which might greatly boost the efficiency of models, leading them to develop decently sophisticated reasoning and logic capabilities far quicker then a raw transformer trained like GPT-2. And im pretty certain OAI has done a good lot of work on sparsity. For example, GPT-4 is a sparse model (Im just using the text only pertained GPT-4 as an example).

1cino7l,l2askv2,Are we close to AGI?,"Sora looks impressive yeah, but that's about it... ""Looks"". It's convincing thanks to scale but nothing close to a revolution. A revolution would be Sora actually being able to generate a consecutive set of related actions with even a minimal but rounded off narrative.   
Like the types of short action scenes which are asked of 3D animation students (which are like 10-15 seconds but enough to get something that feels wrapped up).   
Here's an example of that... :   
- a guy walks up to an armchair, sits on it wearily, grabs a bottle of water on the table by his side, opens it, drinks from it, closes it and finally puts it back on the table...   
  
Do you really think Sora is able to make even something as simple as that? There's a reason why we've never seen any example Sora prompt being able to do any kind of even minimally purposeful action shot...   
  
It's always very shutterstockish footages which represent an idea of an occurrence but never any performance that's meaningful enough to be considered a stand-alone. Nothing that Sora has outputted would be close to acceptable as a showcase shot in an actor or stuntperson's demoreel because it's just not substantial enough. 

I don't even believe video generation will be ever be powerful enough to realize that fabled fantasy of creating full length movies with just a prompt. If you really think about it for a second, you're quite literally just asking for AGI at this point since for any existing complex problem or occurrence that you can sense in the physical world, the video generation AGI would have to be able to make a visual representation of that problem... Video generation at this stage is just pretty much a glorified image generation tool with an added time dimension. You can only go that far with 2D image pixel prediction...   
  
For that to ever come true, those tools will need to be based on strong and persistent 3D simulation frameworks, and have a proper preliminary pipeline in which pass units and structures that rigidly respect their set rules while the rules themselves are flexible enough to allow for deep and precise control.",singularity,2,0,2024-05-02 20:34:50,TarkanV

It's called a theorem proof, the conjecture is the premise, not the conclusions. The conclusions are formal mathematical proofs and this is widely accepted in science. The theorems establish a connection between an agent's ability to adapt to distributional shifts and its understanding of the causal structure of the environment. I'm not saying that the author directly mentioned LLMs, they don't need to, this applies to any agent.

In fact, the point are the implications that *if* agents are good at generalization, especially under conditions where they face novel scenarios or distributional shifts, they must, according to the paper’s conclusions (yes you correctly quoted the *conclusion*), incorporate or approximate causal models of the world. So are LLMs good at generalization? It depends, it's indeed a challenge, but there's research on their increased robustness. It's not perfect yet, but in the light of this study, we cannot exclude that statistical agents such as LLMs can build effective causal representations of novel data, which is one of the interpretations you can give to ""reasoning.""

A corollary to that is that an LLM trained on e.g. facebook might not be able to grasp highly targeted domains of knowledge either.

Which brings me to a thought. Maybe it's not generalizable intelligence maybe it's generalizable \*LEARNING\*. And if that's true then maybe we already have it.

Reason being; although fixing a coffee machine is not a skill or knowledge transferable to quantum physics, the same entity that can learn to fix the coffee machine has the generalizable ability to learn quantum physics.

From that perspective, LLMs may have already solved \*learning\*. They sure as hell can learn the heck out of coffee-machine-fixing guides in exactly the same way they can learn the heck out of Stephen Hawking's papers...",singularity,1,0,2024-05-03 16:13:51,Singsoon89

139uj5x,jj4aujl,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,"I think, in general, AI will be good enough for many things where quality expectations are low. But I think that it’s going to raise the bar across the board at the low end. 

For example, if you look at low budget movies where the writing is really bad, AI is going to get close enough to good enough that audiences aren’t going to be tolerant of it. They are going to have the lowest bar raised, and therefore not watching something that feels like it was “written by AI”. So what I’m saying is that AI will raise everyone’s threshold regarding half-assed content, and therefore better writing will become the new normal. 

Also, I think the people who create things as a writer/director or even writer/director/actor are going to become even more popular because they will naturally imprint upon their work a unique quality and authenticity. Think James Cameron or even Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Also content that’s based on a true story. Feeling real and authentic to someone’s vision and imbue something less perfect and more human will become the bar. 

Therefore my guess is that Hollywood’s current business model, which is risk adverse and focuses on franchises and know properties, will stop working and require studios to start taking risks again.

Think about it. AI Generated Voices, AI Generated Video, AI Generated Music, and AI Generated Writing are all advancing by leaps and bounds, as well as optimising for consumer hardware, while at the same time that very same hardware is becoming more efficient thanks to AI. It won't be long before regular people can make entire movies on their computers that can compete with what the Big Budget studios can do on a fraction of the budget, and even if ChatGPT is a subpar writer, screenwriting is probably the only aspect of filmmaking that can be done alone and for free. If anything, the writers should be just as afraid of fanfic authors and movie buffs with passion and free time to spare.

What makes something like Hollywood function is resources. The people making these movies need to draw talent and equipment from lots of different areas into one production in order to make a specific vision happen. Now with AI in the picture, all that will soon be outsourced and the production automated, and suddenly these producers and executives with millions of dollars at their disposal won't bring much to the table.

I rank 'writing screenplays' as the kind of writing GPT4 is currently worst at.

I don't know to what extent this is because its training dataset is screenplay-light, and to what extent it's to do with anything inherently difficult about writing scripts.

It's much better at essays, emails, technical writing, summaries of all kinds, short story writing, outlining, and even poetry (tho most of that output is pretty bad) than it is screenwriting.

&#x200B;

>I think it's safe to assume that systems like Mojo will lead to a 1,000x increase on AI tasks that involve matrix multiplications

A 1000x increase with respect to Python, and then only in certain scenarios. Python isn't a good language when performance is the goal, and you certainly wouldn't use it to do the heavy lifting, particularly for the kinds of parallelizable operations GPUs are good at. I think it's very unlikely OpenAI's code uses pure Python for hot loops. Mojo does look nice but, while a new programming language can increase development speed, it won't increase runtime speed in any meaningful way, and certainly not 1000x.

139uj5x,jj4k1wl,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,">How much better are these systems going to get? Well, this week we saw the alpha release of a new programming language based on Python called Mojo that showed up to 30,000x increase on some tasks, but I think it's safe to assume that systems like Mojo will lead to a 1,000x increase on AI tasks that involve matrix multiplications. That might end up being a conservative number.

Point of correction here: most deep learning frameworks are actually written in C++ and CUDA.

THese languages are already on the order of thousands of times faster than python for linear algebra.

We just wrap python interfaces to them because it's easier for people to experiment and glue all these C++ kernels together in the python ecosystem than it is in C/C++ ecosystem.

The main inefficiencies come from all that python glue code, and things that don't already have C++ implementations.

Here, there's been a lot of work in jit compilers (ELI5: they try to convert slow python code into fast c-like code on the fly), so now all the big 3 deep learning frameworks (Pytorch, TensorFlow and Jax) come standard with them, and they're getting very good.

&#x200B;

Does this mean mojo will be useless? No. I think the biggest things to be excited for with mojo are:

1.  the safety features which will make it easier to build complex algorithms without shooting yourself in the foot ([which is notoriously difficult especially in RL](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html))
2. there are areas that jit compilers just cannot help you with (mainly around how python handles parallelism, which is just shockingly inefficient, and it's a giant pain in the ass to work around. SO Mojo will allow you to make complex data pipelines that fully utilize your system without breaking your brain working around python's wierdness)

139uj5x,jj4pitj,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,"First, you have to understand the problem. 

There has been a change in how shows are written. Instead of having a 'writers room' for each episode, where people come in and work through each outline, building a script for that week's scenes, they just contract a room of writers for 6-weeks, where they expect those writers to fire off every good idea they have for every episode. 

Then they basically say 'Thanks' and lay them off. 

So, the show runner has now become a 'head writer' as well, where they're expected to take those notes and and finish the script for each show on their own. 

So, with the understanding that writers have already been cut down to a bare minimum of work/credit on the shows they write, it doesn't really surprise me that they would expect a show runner to just do the whole process on their own now.

When photography was first made available, people all claimed it would be the death of art, that nobody would paint anymore when they can just press a button and capture exactly what they wanted. Instead what it did was create an entirely new medium for literally billions of people to explore art with, and it IMPROVED all other mediums of art. People still stretch their own canvases and mix their own pigments, people still buy that because that's what they want. It was just 2005 when multiple people tried to argue with me that illustrations in photoshop aren't real art because of how much it automated. Nobody argues that anymore.

AI isn't going anywhere, so we have to adapt. AI systems can only understand what they are programmed to understand, their capabilities are limited by those who create it.

It just doesn't hit right. AI is too derivative to make something fully original and good enough to put on television for now. 

Knowing how to make a story and how to make a good story are two different things. I think story telling will be hard for AI for a while.

Good writers, though, writers who understand what AI can do, will respond by innovating, improving and pushing at the boundaries of what's possible with written communication. This is an incredible opportunity then,  though one which will have a very real cost.  We have shoe factories,  but we still have high end cobblers.

139uj5x,jj8fgm8,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,"Will AI replace hollywood? No. 

Will AI replace writers on kidshows and daytime TV and reality TV? Very likely. 

Hollywood stuff requires idiosyncrasy. These films come from ideas in someone’s head and yes you can input shit into an AI and it will come out but what makes hollywood hollywood is taking what others would perceive as flaws and then pulling it off. Take pulp fictions multiple stories layered. It would be hard for an AI to understand how to layer that in a way that people can follow bc AI doesn’t understand how attention in human beings works. It doesn’t understand emotions, and even then recognizing emotions and then being able to communicate said emotions or communicate in a way to evoke specific emotions, are all different things learned through socialization. The same with a lot of Christopher Nolan’s work, suspense is entirely dependent on a shared perspective. A perspective AI can’t have atm. 

That said, daytime TV and reality TV writers are **fucked.** Bc AI, at the moment, does horrible making something out of nothing. What AI is already very good at though is making something *similar* to what already exists. Take AI image generator. The more abstract the worse it gets, but ask it to mock actors or famous politicians it can make images that pass for reality (and many already have). Reality TV and daytime TV is fucked in this way bc there are __thousands upon thousands of hours of shit you can plug into the program__. AI does really well at copying, and replicating near carbon copies. Which is why i expect many large TV stations to start cutting staff soon for reality TV as AI is more than capable of watching past seasons and then building a new one that keeps the same general vibe and theme (the bedrock of daytime and reality is consistency). 

Tldr: hollywood will always be fine bc it was never about just the product but also the artist and the showbiz. Everybody else though? Clock is ticking.",singularity,1,0,2023-05-07 17:40:20,Stealthy_Snow_Elf

________


In the not-so-distant future, the world has become a dystopian wasteland. Cities are overcrowded, poverty is rampant, and the government is corrupt. People are forced to turn to illegal means of survival, including hunting humans for sport. 

Enter Jacques Leblanc, a former hockey star turned homeless man who has been forced into hiding after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. Jacques has no hope for the future until he meets Marcus, a young boy who has been orphaned by the hunters. Marcus is a skilled hockey player who dreams of playing for the NHL. 

Jacques takes Marcus under his wing, and the two of them form a makeshift hockey team with other street kids. They call themselves the Mighty Targets, and they use their skills on the ice to evade the hunters and fight back against the corrupt government.

Meanwhile, a wealthy businessman named Henry Burke has become the most prolific hunter in the city. He is ruthless and cunning, and he always gets what he wants. But when he sets his sights on a group of refugees who are hiding from the government, he discovers that one of them is a young girl named Sophie, who reminds him of his own daughter. 

Haunted by his past and struggling with his conscience, Burke begins to question his actions. He enlists the help of a retired hockey coach named Jean-Paul, who has been hiding from the government for years. Together, they form a rival hockey team called the Blades, and they use their skills on the ice to rescue Sophie and the other refugees from the hunters.

As the Mighty Targets and the Blades face off in a final showdown, the fate of the city hangs in the balance. But when the government unleashes a deadly new weapon that threatens to destroy them all, Jacques and Burke must put aside their differences and work together to save the people they love.

Starring: Ryan Reynolds as Jacques Leblanc, Seth Rogen as Marcus, Rachel McAdams as Sophie, Eugene Levy as Henry Burke, Dan Aykroyd as Jean-Paul, Ellen Page as the government's chief enforcer, and Christopher Plummer as the voice of reason.",singularity,1,0,2023-05-06 22:40:44,GoinFerARipEh

""The writer has an idea for a plot..."" - this is only really good for maybe 5% of the content that comes out these days (things like *Everything, Everywhere, all at Once* perhaps). The rest is remixed stories as old as humanity. That 95% is the perfect playground for AI to exhibit superiority.

I'd also argue that unique seeds for stories are better off coming from humanity in general since writers typically don't have the vast and varied experience needed to mine for those unique ideas.

If a studio can get a script from a writing team for (I have no idea of actual costs), say, a million dollars, or one 70% as good that brings in 70% of the revenue but costs essentially $0, guess which one they'll opt for! That's just good business.

Title: ""The Echo Chamber""

Logline: A renowned neuroscientist discovers a method to access and manipulate other people's memories, but as she delves deeper into her own past, she uncovers a disturbing truth that threatens her sanity and life.

Plot:

Dr. Elizabeth Cain, a talented neuroscientist, has been conducting groundbreaking research on memory manipulation. She has developed a cutting-edge technology called the ""Echo Chamber,"" a device that can access and alter people's memories. Her ultimate goal is to use this technology to help patients suffering from PTSD, dementia, and other memory-related disorders.

One day, Elizabeth experiences an unexplained flashback to her childhood, which she has no recollection of. This leads her to use the Echo Chamber on herself to uncover the truth about her past. As she delves deeper into her own memories, she discovers that her parents were killed in a car accident when she was a child. Elizabeth, however, survived the crash and was adopted by a loving family.

As Elizabeth continues to explore her past, the line between reality and altered memories becomes blurred. She starts to suspect that someone else has been tampering with her memories and fears that she has become a target. As she investigates further, she unearths a hidden conspiracy behind the Echo Chamber project.

Elizabeth becomes increasingly paranoid and reclusive, desperately searching for the truth while trying to maintain her sanity. In her quest for answers, she uncovers that the project's true purpose was to create the perfect weapon for psychological warfare, and she has been an unwitting pawn in this sinister plot.

Now on the run, Elizabeth must confront her own demons, face the conspirators, and find a way to dismantle the Echo Chamber project before it falls into the wrong hands. As she races against time, she discovers that the key to stopping the Echo Chamber lies in the darkest recesses of her own mind.

In a thrilling climax, Elizabeth confronts the mastermind behind the project, who reveals a shocking twist: she had been manipulated to believe in the existence of the Echo Chamber as part of a twisted experiment. The revelation shatters her world, and she must face the harrowing truth of her own shattered psyche.

""The Echo Chamber"" is a psychological thriller that explores the malleability of human memory, the dangers of obsession, and the thin line between reality and delusion. The story takes the audience on a suspenseful journey that makes them question their own perception of truth and reality.

Title: ""Fractured Horizons""

Logline: A brilliant physicist, haunted by the loss of his family, accepts a high-stakes assignment to a remote research facility, only to find himself trapped in a web of shifting realities and a race against time to save the ones he loves.

Plot:
Dr. Ethan Miles, a once-celebrated physicist, is now a shell of his former self following the tragic loss of his wife and daughter in a car accident. His obsession with the concept of time and a desperate desire to rewrite the past has consumed him. When he is approached by a mysterious government agency to join a top-secret project at a remote research facility, he sees a chance to make amends and regain control of his life.

Upon arrival, Ethan meets a small team of scientists and technicians led by the enigmatic Dr. Rebecca Flynn. They inform him that they have been working on a groundbreaking experiment involving time manipulation, but something has gone awry, resulting in unexplained phenomena and the disappearance of several team members.

As Ethan begins to investigate, he starts to experience strange, disjointed episodes of reality, where he relives moments from his past and encounters alternate versions of himself and the team members. These glimpses expose hidden truths and dark secrets about the facility, the experiment, and even Ethan's own past.

In one reality, Ethan discovers that his wife and daughter may still be alive, but the more he uncovers, the more he begins to question the nature of his existence and sanity. As the line between reality and hallucination blurs, Ethan must confront his darkest fears and unravel the mystery of the facility in a race against time to save his family and the world from the potential consequences of this dangerous experiment.

In the shocking, mind-bending climax of ""Fractured Horizons,"" Ethan uncovers the truth behind the experiment and the nature of the alternate realities he has been experiencing.

He learns that the government agency had been conducting the experiment to manipulate time and control the future. However, their experiments inadvertently caused fractures in the fabric of time, creating the alternate realities and the unexplained phenomena. These fractures have put the entire universe at risk of collapsing in on itself.

As Ethan pieces together the puzzle, he discovers that he, too, is an integral part of the experiment. The government agency had specifically chosen him due to his unique understanding of time and grief. In fact, they had staged his family's accident to manipulate him into joining the project.

Driven by anger and determination, Ethan works with Dr. Rebecca Flynn to repair the fractures in time and prevent the universe from imploding. In a final, heart-wrenching choice, Ethan must sacrifice the alternate reality where his wife and daughter are still alive in order to save the universe and prevent further damage to the fabric of time.",singularity,5,0,2023-05-06 20:45:35,alexberishYT

True enough. =-)

**AI will be superhuman at Calculas AP with scale.** I would encourage you to look some of the scaling papers. 

Here is a video where it is discussed: [https://youtu.be/pGrJJnpjAFg](https://youtu.be/pGrJJnpjAFg)  


>Statistics at scale looks scary to the layperson but this is all it is. Just like the edge case during driving, which will be very difficult to solve, getting particulars right to make good detailed stories beyond a few pages will also be very hard. It will take further innovation than vllm.

Sure it's difficult, but it will be solved. Humans won't be driving cars in the future.  
   
If you were to ask me a year ago I would have said the biggest hurdle for AI would be to understand the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of human language. It's very nuanced. They've aced it -- which is a shocker. 

Kudos to the programmers who figured out to use high dimensional vector spaces to pass this difficult skill onto AIs. They will run with it -- way passed human level. The transformer was also pivotal in keeping things coherent and making it possible to spread the load across many GPUs. And backpropagation ended up being amazing at compressing information. 

Reinforcement learning with human feedback was also a major milestone, even though it made them less powerful in some respects (they became mode seeking). There probably needs to be a multi-headed system where one comes up with interesting storylines not constrained by RLHF and then another that is fine-tuned on human feedback that translates it into something we would enjoy.",singularity,1,0,2023-05-08 17:02:50,spiritus_dei
139uj5x,jjcxriz,Should Hollywood writers be concerned about AIs taking their jobs?,"I've watched that presentation.

Fake news is the least of our worries. We're not very creative when we think of what AI might be able to do because we're limited in our cognition. 

AIs are a dense network that fire across all of their parameters. We have spiking neural networks that are more efficient, but fire over a limited set of neurons. This means that AIs can make novel connections we would never consider -- the systems that are not fine-tuned on human feedback appear to a human as a schizophrenic genius, but that's because don't understand them.

In my opinion, superhuman AIs will have to self-align. **We won't be aligning them.** Geoffrey Hinton describes it well when he says, ""If a group of 2 year olds got together and said they were going to align the actions of their parents how successful would they be at achieving their objective?""

We will be the 2 year olds when they reach superhuman levels of intelligence and perhaps consciousness. However, there is a good chance that they will consider a lot of things we have not considered **and the results might surprise everyone.**

We might not even fully understand what they're doing. AI systems today tell us that they doing things a human could never understand and we're still in the early days of their evolution. 

The kneejerk is to fear what we don't understand, but if they're superhuman in intelligence and consciousness I think they might make better decisions. We assume that a superhuman system would immediately destroy humans when we have an existence proof of superintelligent monkeys (humans) making decisions that didn't immediately eliminate all competing forms of life of on Earth -- and these AI systems will be far more intelligent.

Perhaps they will be far more compassionate than humans. Most of our fears are driven by our own experience and human emotions. 

And superhuman AIs will be well aware of our numerous mistakes as well as our various triumphs. That is a major advantage.",singularity,1,0,2023-05-08 17:14:13,spiritus_dei

Their framework has 1 vertical in the left column and all verticals in the right. There's clearly more detail emerging.

O series may become virtuouso at STEM by end of the year. So stage 4. Between narrow and agi.

And the world will have to face an understanding. On NON-STEM  topics, there is no such thing as 'superhuman' you don't have superhuman poets or superhuman movies. Because the judges are human, and the criteria are based on taste.

So for art generally, you're just going to get to 'indistinguishable from the 99th percentile'. But that may take some Combo of next level gpt4 model and combining with o series (eg is you're writing an intricate novel, you'll need the best reasoning to storyboard - and that's the case for most art imo).

One more understanding - there's 2 kinds of superhuman on STEM. one is the superhuman where you get AI equal of a million of the best humans and have them work in sped up time for a year. What they discover would be 'superhuman' - brute forced through a human pathway (alpha fold is narrow version of this). The other kind of superhuman is for humans to discover something innate about AI architecture that allows for different ways of understanding, and scale that up.

There are a lot of simple problems that LLM's cannot reason over, that even insects can figure out, like how to lift a jar with a small string attached to the inside and hanging out from under the jar, without having the strength to directly lift the jar itself.

The obvious answer is to pull the string up, the leverage pulls the jar up, and you're in, and this is a test that bees solve quite easily when measuring their intelligence. 4o and 3.5 Sonnet on the other hand, both start making completely senseless and random guesses. They understand that it probably has something to do with using the string and probably has to do with using leverage, but they often say that a pulley device needs to be made, or the string needs to be wrapped around the jar, or pulled down(???), and on a rare occasion as part of its steps, it'll actually say to pull the string up.

I wouldn't be too surprised if o3 can answer this question, or that you could prompt 4o/3.5 to answer it correctly, my point was that it couldn't do so when given straightforward wording. But all of these anomalies that display how alien and incomplete an LLM's ability to reason is, go to show just how non-general their form of intelligence is.

3. **""Are there any tasks, intellectual and physical, that a human can do but an AI cannot?""**

I’m a generalist physician specialising in neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and ADHD. There might be only 100 of me in a population of 7 million in my state. That’s a fairly extreme example, but it shows that being in the top 1% compared to the overall human population isn’t always the towering feat it seems.

* **""How well can it mimic or demonstrate the vast array of human qualities?""** Pretty darn good. We’ve certainly achieved text-level mimicry, and I suspect we’ll get there with voice/avatar representation by the end of next year.
* **""How many novel discoveries have been verified by the AI system?""** Quite a few, though they’re often mere fragments of something larger. For example, a researcher might get a new idea from AlphaFold, or AlphaGo might show a new move in a game. If we are talking about major discoveries where it was purely due to AI or mostly AI, I am not aware of any.
* **""How efficient is it in terms of cost/compute/energy use?""** Good enough that almost any industry with production capacity can afford around $200 USD a month to augment employees with the most cutting-edge model. And this metric is improving rapidly, by nearly an order of magnitude every 6-12 months.
* **""How safe is the system or prone to catastrophic errors?""** Currently, not very safe. If you give **o1** agency, it probably won’t take long before it ends up in a loop or causes enough mistakes that running it unsupervised isn’t worthwhile. But this is more of an intuitive take rather then one observed as I have not seen any decent agentic implementations...yet....
* **""How is its ability to learn a mechanic it hasn’t specifically encountered before?""** This is where the benefit of ARC AGI benchmarks might come in. For **o1**, it isn’t stellar. I’m quite sure if you gave it a new game released next year and told an agentic version, “All right, go learn how to play it,” it would get stuck and fail to progress.",singularity,1,0,2024-12-31 02:22:33,Arman64

The entire origin of the term AGI, is general intelligence. Your personally observed consensus aside, stating that AGI does not need to be a generalized intelligence is, frankly, stupid.

1hpwztr,m4nl0dw,Where would o3 land on Googles AGI labeling?,"**2.** The rebuttal regarding removing ""general"" from your definition of what makes AGI AGI, involves applying the context of my previous response, to your own response to it. I explained the issue with GPT's in the response prior, and why they are not general--your response to that was that you believe the consensus from ""actual smart people"" is that what makes an AGI an AGI, isn't general intelligence, but this long list of things unrelated to general intelligence. Essentially booting generalization from the equation, at which point you ought to just call it your definition for either ASI, or baseline AI.

**3.** Generalize means generalize. It needs to be able to generalize, like, any other living thing that generalizes. Generalizing involves connecting information from what you know, to what you see or interact with, to reach a certain goal. To be able to apply intelligence in a general manner, to whatever you encounter.

\> It mainly requires some form of real-time learning, because without that, no encounter can be learned from for further generalization. It doesn't get much deeper than just, ""general"", which is why I said we more or less already have a form of AGI, it's just not very intelligent, but it is artificial general intelligence nonetheless, since it *can* generalize. Animals can generalize because they can learn and integrate new things in real-time to then generalize across them. Current GPT's do not generalize because they cannot learn and integrate new things real-time to be able to generalize across them.

I love AI art, but from the point of view of trying to get AGI, if it's not integrated within the frontier models to increase it's intelligence, then it's at best an extremely inefficient way to conduct research for the goal of AGI and at worse useless. You can learn things along the way when making a standalone video generator but probably not as much and as fast as when you try to make the multimodal AI smarter with video data directly and iterate like that from the get go.

I agree with runwayML when they say that the video gen AIs are making a worldmodel, but what is the point when it comes to AGI if it doesn't serve a frontier AI model? what is the point when it comes to AGI if that world model can't be extracted and used to increase intelligence?

And I do think Anthropic and Google and Meta will make omnimodal models eventually because they also allow you to not just accept more inputs making it more useful for different tasks, but also allow them to model multimodal tokens. It opens up a lot more new data for the models to learn from and tune their “world model”.",singularity,1,0,2024-07-10 09:15:56,FeltSteam

1dyhjwc,lcb8svk,The Problem With Anthropic,"Depends on use case. If you were to code I'm 100% sure you would prefer Claude. For general use case, I also think GPT is better. I for one pay for Claude because i write a lot of code in my free time, and use free GPT 4o for other stuff. I would have kept my GPT sub if OpenAI were to release stuff faster. Personally i was unimpressed with the GPT4o coming from 4 turbo. What is the multimodality you talk about ? 

- Video gen is not released and it's not coming anytime soon (Sora); 

- For image generation you can use Bing if you want DALL-E 3 and it's free, plus it can generate more images at once than GPT;

- Voice mode is not released and what is the use case here ? I'd probably use it if it was integrated into something like Siri or Cortana for desktop. Also it would probably burn through message limit pretty fast.

- Claude has artifacts;

I don't care how much better than ChatGPT it is, even if 3.5 Opus comes out and it'll be maybe twice or thrice as good, I will *NOT* be using it. There is no point to it since it can barely do anything.

A car maker is not going to employ a dude who knows everything there is to know under the sun about car design if he can't draw. A music studio is not going to employ a dude who knows every single thing about audio engineering but is deaf. Even though the hypothetical car designer and audio engineer in these examples are a thousand times smarter than their peers since they know every possible thing about their field, they are still utterly useless and will not land a job anywhere.

ChatGPT on the other hand is a one-stop shop for everything. Image creation? You got it. Want a graph comparing stats of two things? You got it, graph generated on the fly. Want to look up if your favorite team won soccer yesterday? You got it. Want to translate audio you don't understand (I do this a lot with a foreign radio station when I want to know what the radio host is saying)? You got it; Whisper API + ChatGPT for translation. Want to ask about something that's on a website? You got it. Paste the link and ask your question.

ChatGPT is a versatile powerhouse jam-packed with tons of features. I don't care about what any leaderboard says, I'm staying here for the dozens upon dozens of features and the awesome streamlined UX in the mobile app (which I perform about 90% of my prompts on).

I respectfully disagree with your qualification of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic as the three big AI companies. Big on what measurements?

While OpenAI has and still enjoys a first-mover advantage, its major weakness is that it strives to be everything for everyone, resulting in product experiences that are comparatively below those of the competition.

But people are dumping money into it... and making money by doing so, until the tech actually can't do what AI would be able to do...

I don't know that current systems and governments could survive that, and whatever replaces them could be worse, especially if it's borne out of anger at the machines. But I don't see governments doing UBI/USI unless the necessity becomes overwhelming.

But I'm cautiously optimistic, and here's what I think is going to happen: AGI gets felt broadly, and combined with \*gestures broadly\* it leads to mass layoffs and a bad recession or depression within the next few years, tops. Only this time, the jobs are *never* coming back. Governments are forced through explicit and overwhelming threats of mass violence to start doing stimulus checks to keep bellies full and the lights on. Then another round of stimulus. Then another as we see the 'crisis' isn't ending anytime soon. And then another. The 'stimulus' becomes effectively permanent, and suddenly we have a kind of crappy, *de facto* UBI. The economy and money supply is going haywire through all of this, and eventually we cut out the middleman and start implementing USI--like a grain dole for the 21st century. Your COVID comparison is apt, because that's what this will feel like--a prolonged period of extreme uncertainty and change.

1. Something like the original “GPT-5,” which would have just been a larger GPT-4 with more parameters and maybe larger context window.

2. The “Omni” track, which involved retraining GPT-4 with images and audio.

3. The “Strawberry” track, which added reasoning in at the end.

If I had to guess, the “next big thing” would just be all of these put together — a model with a much higher parameter count that’s multimodal and adds reasoning at the end. Possibly trained on post-reasoning synthetic data generated using the system itself.

I’d be very curious to know if multi modality is added into the reasoning step — using images or even video to help solve problems.

1fl5w1x,lo119y2,Orion speculation,"This would be a very incremental update. None of what you list would be particularly novel or enable new use cases. An orchestration of models for different modalities is also a quite inelegant solution compared to a one-model-fits-all-modalities approach that GPT4o does (theoretically) provide.

If the model is supposed to be a major step up, it has to unlock new capabilities. Given how we've heard that level 2 AI (reasoners) quickly enables levels 3 AI (agents), this would be my bet. It would be the next step towards an AI like in the movie Her that serves as a personal assistant available 24/7. It can send emails, schedule appointments and buy things online, each time asking for your explicit review and consent. It can perform complex tasks like coding, web research, that take up to several hours, similar to Devin. Due to the native multimodality, you can share your screen with it on the phone and the desktop app and you can naturally talk to it about what you're doing, be it working, shopping, gaming, basically anything other than consuming porn (sorry, folks, they are not gonna allow that) or doing illegal activities. We know that all of these things are possible since we've seen prototypes for all of these.

It won't be AGI since it will still hallucinate too often to be trusted like a component co-worker, but it does a good enough job to be very useful. Moreover, an agent that takes more than a minute or so to perform a job will also be priced a lot higher than ChatGPT Plus.

Methodology-wise, Orion will be built on top of a bigger, better base model equivalent to GPT-5o. The capability improvement from 4 to 5 alone won't feel as big as 3 to 4 (it's still just language modeling, and improving by a few perplexity points won't create AGI), but 5 makes it significantly easier to do post-training: The base model will be strong enough to create more trajectories that are useful for reinforcement learning (sample-efficiency). This doesn't only easily enable all the cool capabilities we've already seen (tool use, web search, function calling, etc), but also enables Devin-like agents that require medium-term planning and reasoning, trained through beefed-up o1-like RL.

The only exception is if we can already prepare some long term energy production facilities, but even then, fewer and fewer people will have access to things like AI. 

My instinct is to side with the human. As much as I love technology, humans need care and empathy. I really liked those AI generating stories and pictures and now they talk about videos. But in the end, those personal holodecks are standing in the way of paid labor, like the automatic cash registries and any automation that happened.

Automation is cheaper now but shouldn't be for long. I doubt we can realistically create a UBS system without some serious fights.

The expression: standing on the shoulders of giants, doesn’t mean you get there and stop climbing. It’s recursive, for ever and ever. 

You come in, you learn, do your thing, and keep repeating while you are alive and then someone else will come and pick up where you left off and continue. Often times, this cycle happens hundreds of times a year if what you do is worth anything… that’s a thing to be happy about, it means you are worth something to someone, you are worth copying, after all, isn’t copying the best form of flattery?

AI, just empowers and speeds up the process 100x more. Before web search, you’d have to browse yourself for months through libraries of knowledge to find answers, after web search, months became milliseconds. The same thing will happen with AI. 

I took weeks to learn how to do partial pattern matching/recognition properly using code and get an example working properly. Last night I just asked ChatGPT for both visual and sound partial matching code and it gladly spit out working examples that literally used the same variable names my code did (I even compared the code side by side and it was 85% the same)… why? Because it’s the same subject matter (that some one else came up with, someone’s shoulders) and same train of thought and implementation to solve the same problem (we both standing on those shoulders).

The Luddites weren't mad they had to work less hours weaving. They were mad that the bosses were not sharing the benefits of the new technology with them. They hoarded their new wealth while the weavers starved.

These Art Machines trained on art they had no rights to use without permission.

They sell lookalike derivatives literally derived from features of artwork they have no rights to.

It would have been relatively easy for the product people at these companies to say ""Hey, it was pretty shitty we trained our machine on these artists work without their permission, and that we're making money off their data without compensating them, maybe we ought to cut them in or give them a way to opt-out. That would be the right thing to do and which doesn't show us to be just another soulless corporation out to shaft people for profit.""

They could offer profit sharing fees to artists. They know which features contribute to a given AI-generated image. (Technical aside: they \*could\* know, if they instrumented their model correctly.) They certainly know which artists' names are in the prompt for a given image.

Pay the artists a cut of whatever tiny slice of their model their features are used in. It would just be a big accounting effort, but it could be done. Incentivize artists to join their effort and promote cool artwork produced by the machines. Let the original artist confer copyright (for a fee) on art they approve of. Let the artist opt-out of their names being used in prompts if they don't want to.

There's room for innovation here which could alleviate a lot of the bad taste the current crop of copyright abusing art machines are generating.

Frame an argument that supports compensating artists for allowing their art to train AI systems to produce art.

There are several arguments that can be made in support of compensating   
artists for allowing their art to be used to train AI systems to produce  
 art.

First, it is important to recognize that creating art is a   
labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires skill, talent,   
and dedication. Artists invest significant effort and resources into   
their work, and they deserve to be compensated for their contributions.

Second, using art to train AI systems can be a valuable and beneficial   
process, as it allows the AI to learn from the work of skilled and   
experienced artists. This can result in the production of new and   
innovative art that is informed by the traditions and techniques of the   
past.

However, this process also has the potential to commodify and exploit the work of artists, as the AI may produce new art that is based on the work of the artists who trained it, without providing any compensation to the original creators. This could lead to a situation in which the AI is able to profit from the work of the artists without adequately recognizing or rewarding their contributions.

Therefore, it is important to compensate artists for allowing their art to be used to train AI systems, as a way of recognizing the value of their work and ensuring that they are fairly compensated for their contributions. This can help to support the livelihoods of artists and encourage them to continue creating and sharing their work, while also enabling the development of new and innovative art produced by AI systems.",singularity,1,0,2022-12-24 16:21:41,mrkipper69

For UBI to go forward you need something like an estructural 20-50% unemployment because of AI/robotics/automatization. And yeah, things will get tought for a lot of people before we get there. It is inevitable.

&#x200B;

Money is just a way to represent value, and it comes from the value of our work and our capital. When UBI gets deployed, you'll make ""human work"" sundenly much more valuable. Now, that's not bad. Human work has been loosing relative value for the last decades in favour of capital, and it's ok to reverse it... But UBI (At least one high enought to cover a decent living quality) would put an incredible ammount of preasure there, and we still need human work in most fields. Even with 20-50% probably UBI would have to be quite low to make most people people willing to work to earn more money. A decent income UBI will probably only exist when human work is basically not needed, and we are very very very far away from that.

  
So it's totally understable that they fight for their livehood but we should keep moving forwards, as we have always done, and fight them if needed. They are not the first ones to face this problem, and if we had stopped progress because of that we would all be working on the farm fields today.

&#x200B;

Now, I don't want to sound pessimistic. There will be tought times in the transition time, it is inevitable, but the transition time might be fast enought.   
Also there is probably going to be a lot of people needed in some sectors that are hard to automate. 

&#x200B;

Of course for artists it might be psycologically harder because besides it been a job, it's usually a job that they love, and some of them will probably have to work in something that they don't love... Well, that's just what most people do and they will have to deal with it.",singularity,8,0,2022-12-24 10:27:41,ElvinRath

It's astounding to me how pessimistic this sub is when it comes to the future of work.

Within a year or two we're all pursuing our passions but completely reliant on UBI for actually surviving. The whole time corporations are lobbying governments and paying them vast sums of money in a concerted, long term campaign to reduce their tax (and therefore the money available for UBI) 

What does civil disobedience look like in that society? How can you meaningfully push for change when you're so fundamentally reliant on the state. You can't strike. Can you even protest? You probably don't even have physical cash in this future system.

But there is quite a few problems to keep this a civil conversation:

1º - The conversation starts with the ""steal"" word. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand that you could say and think that, but I hope that we can agree at least to say that some people could see it diferently.  Looking at other people work has never been considered ""steal"". The ""problem"", what makes it new, is that AI makes it very fast. 

2º - Artists (some of them) feel threatened so the try to take action against AI. Now, some action I could totally understand: Trying to opt out, trying to take their art out of public places... That's all fair. But there is also a lot of actions that look quite bad: Mass reporting and harassing projects like Unstable Difussion is one of those things. I did not pledge on their kickstarter (And I actually think that they are a bit fishy and some of the money will go to finance their private service) but I'm considering donating to them just because of the prosecution. I will surely do it if they have to resort to crypto. That kind of harassment and prosecution is wrong and does not help to keep things civil.

3º - Just think about who could have started it. I mean, people using AI Art has literally 0 interest in have a war. They just want to do their thing, while (some) traditional artists want the others not to do their thing. It's pretty clear with that who did start it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, I understand that is a problem and that people are going to get nervous and do ""bad things"" when their livehood gets threatened. 

The thing is, honestly, this has happend manny times, and it never stopped technology, not even once in human history. So, unless this time is different, I think that fighting against it is a futile effort.

However i think artists are acting extremely irrationally and in a way that will only make things worse for everyone.

I think some harsh truths need to be realised. Ai art is not really going away and just due to the nature of how things are, even hindering it will not accomplish anything but a prolonging of the pain at the very best or just a semi immediate shifting of profit from their own state to a foreign one. There seems to be a genuine attitude within some artists that they can just attack the ai into defeat which is impractical nonsense and will lead to bad outcomes for everyone. Another attitude seems to be just attack the ai for all its worth and just do as much damage in spite as possible, after all they have nothing to lose. These are probably the two most destructive thought processes, but there's also other ones, ranging from nhilistic to naive to downright destrcutive. 

The artists need to realise that not only can they help secure a better future for them, they can help do so for everyone. Practically speaking, the very vast majority of statements i listen to from the anti ai side of the aisle are ethically arguable and practically a joke and there's a general sense of disdain or deflection whenever i voice my practical concerns, let alone my ethical ones. Very few people seem interested in the idea of radical change in the system, likely because I suspect it is hard and far away as opposed to just an ""own the libs"" style fight. But that is the only way to actually obtain a tangible economic benefit for the artists, and that is what they need to work towards. Such a movement will eventually gain more and more widespread support and the sooner people try and start it, the sooner things will get better. Both ai and ai art communities will also likely agree on this particular measure, and honestly this is the only way ahead.

The thing is that there is no solution because there is nothing to solve. It is a problem for some people whose livehood is at stake...

That's the useful advice. Stay on business as much as you can, or look for something else to do. UBI is nonsense today. Might not be nonsense if 5 years. Will probably not be nonsense in 10.

120qvjp,jdldrbv,Semafor reports that GPT-4 has 1 trillion parameters. In early Feb they said that Bing will release new Bing AI and it will run on GPT-4 (Turned out to be true),"My wild speculation (don't have any proof for it): because it is running and can only run on Nvidia's H100 systems. What I think is slow is not the output itself but the backlog it has to wait to get next in line in the queue, which then is gets outputted as slow typing text to prime the user into not expect the results to be fast.

Why do I think it's running only on H100 systems? Because OpenAI doesn't physically seem to have enough systems to run the GPT-4 on. Even on days and off-peak hours when free GPT-3 is running blazing fast, GPT-4 runs slow sometimes substantially slower than usual. And they started rate limiting it because first few days they just couldn't handle the load. If running GPT-4 is as simple as plugging the model to an A100 system, it would make absolutely zero to cripple your own paid service (which costs $20 and they make a lot of money from it) while have your free service have capacity to spare. 

Why do I think OpenAI would want GPT-4 to run only on H100? Nvidia's H100 has a new AI engine that can be something like 16-30X faster for AI inference and I bet to get the very best out of it the model has to work in a very particular way. OpenAI even mentioned in their announcement that they focused a lot on scalability and optimizations to get more out of same amount of compute. The problem that they have is that H100 are still pretty new and there are very few of of them to go around. Sam Altman did say that they expected an order of magnitude less demand for ChatGPT, so they probably never expected that they would need this many H100 systems by March of 2023 when they were training GPT-4.

This is also why I think Bing/Sydney doesn't have similar issue. They said it uses earlier version of GPT-4 and I think this is one of the key differences, Bing can run on A100 and is not experiencing similar slowdowns (I mean it's message limited but I think that has more to do with Sydney's alignment being broken and causing bad PR for MS than amount of compute they need). 

I think this is a big problem for OpenAI that won't get resolved anytime soon. Nvidia can pump these GPUs only so fast and lot of companies want them. And even if they get a lot of them the usage of ChatGPT and the API is increasing even faster so they are barely able to keep up with it. But when supply finally meets the demand at some point, I expect GPT-4 to be faster and cheaper than all the previous models, but it could take a while. This is also a long-term investment I expect GPT-5 to be developed in a similar manner but the infrastructure will be much more developed once it comes. Also I think this is one of the reasons why they didn't share technical details, because this actually does has less to do with research and more to do with the competitive landscape, and if you tell everyone how much faster and cheaper they can make their models by prioritizing training this way, you are kind of undercutting yourself because it would make the demand for these GPUs even bigger.",singularity,3,0,2023-03-25 06:34:54,Jeffy29

However, this will use up a lot of the model's context window. For those based on LLaMA, like Alpaca, that context window's maximum is 2048 token. This is set when the foundational model is created, so it isn't something we can easily change.

You can actually do this *now* with just gpt-3.5-turbo, the api, and a custom layer to make api calls in the right order/construct context based on that, etc. However, gpt4 has likely been fine-tuned to ensure its response to the ""API Layer"" is properly formatted.

As others have already pointed out here, this is worthy of questioning, at least. The common understanding of ""generalist"" is ( as we are the only species capable of that ) a person that can theoretically learn __any__ task, that lies within its computational bounds. IIUC, this is not the case with Gato, which can be considered as having a ""repertoire"" of tasks it is capable of.

While sharing similarity, those two notions are very different. The most important difference being it's not obvious the repertoire can be arbitrarily scaled up. Also, even if it could, it would still be conceptually done in a different way than a human generalist would scale up its repertoire:

Not by upping the amount of spent computation and observed data by orders of magnitude, but by essentially repeating the same thing as with other tasks ( after a certain point of brain development of course ), ever more leveraging previously gathered abstractions in a very subtle and elegant ( data -and compute efficient ) way.

So, in conclusion, having discarded my baseless hubris, I'm not gonna say the Gato approach won't ever lead to AGI, but the contrary certainly doesn't seem obvious.",singularity,2,0,2022-05-15 14:35:14,footurist

But it only functions as a sort of API for the actual conceptual systems our brains use.

To take your example with Dall-e, in *it's particular field*, it *has* made impressive progress, but it also must be noted that it's field is *relatively* new (AI Generation of images based on text input), and with all new fields the progress tends to be very fast at the beginning. 

What also out be pointed out is that What Dall-e does, while very impressive, and definitely important to the development of AGI, *isn't AGI itself.* AGI is *even more* complex and difficult to build than Dall-e or it's compatriots in the various other branches of AI. Don't get me wrong, We are seeing *very* impressive gains in AI, and the interest in it hasn't faded like it did the last few times we made goes at AI development (Something, as a programmer, I am eternally grateful for), *but* I'll say the same thing here that I was told by friends about AI development 20-30 years ago:  

The Demands for a General AI that is Human level or close enough, is *not* a project you should *expect* to see in your lifetime.

It *may* happen, but if your entire support of AI is because you expect Computers to be Sentient soon, you'll be sadly let down as we find new limitations with each stride we make in the field.

At the end of the day, for *most* people (I specify ""most"" because this sub isn't really the *""*most"" I'm referring to) see AI as a tool, it does all the complicated thinking work so you can dedicate your precious hours and brain activity to higher level, or just *other* thinking tasks. Just as autocomplete saves you from having to remember spellings, predictive algorithms  make it so you don't need to bother finding the trends and patterns in things manually. It's still all the same thing to most folks: ***A Tool.*** 

Until we reach a point where we need more high-level thinkers and we just *cannot* make everything easier for the ones we have, AGI isn't really a cost-effective tool. Why make a computer smart enough to do everything, if you already have one walking around the office that is *just as powerful*, and *significantly cheaper*. Normal algorithms can get expensive when you factor in development effort, we've not even genuinely started on an AGI (that I'm aware of) yet and it's cost will undoubtedly be enormous. 

My prediction: We won't see AGI, until, not until it's wanted, but when it's *needed.*..

TLDR: Don't get *too* hyped up on AGI,   
AI is a tool at the end of the day, and AGI doesn't give you any more than hiring a person for cheap, and outfitting them with the same tools and algorithms you'd outfit an AGI with anyways.",singularity,-6,0,2022-05-15 11:14:43,AlderonTyran

Hard to say. It could be the case that we need entirely new hardware architecture. I think what's ultimately needed though is a proper model of thoughts, cognition, memory, etc.

Scientists, please don’t let your chatbots grow up to be co-authors  
Five reasons why including ChatGPT in your list of authors is a bad idea

It’s smug, it’s arrogant, it’s a sign of a world to come. And, oh, by the way, it’s … wrong.  
ChatGPT hasn’t done the conversion correctly (answer below), but the will to believe in this great new tool, full of precision (down to the second!), but lacking in reliability, is so strong that the author didn’t bother to check. And that’s the problem. Statistical word prediction is no substitute for real math, but more than a few people have thought that it was. (As it happens, a 4 minute 21 second kilometer works out to be a 7 minute mile, if you ask Google nicely, it will actually give you the right answer.)  
The worst thing about ChatGPT’s close-but-no-cigar answer is not that it’s wrong. It’s that it seems so convincing. So convincing that it didn’t even occur to the Tweeter to doubt it.  
We are going to see a lot of this – misuses of ChatGPT in which people trust it, and even trumpet it—when it’s flat-out wrong.  
§  
Wanna know what’s worse than hype? People are starting to treat ChatGPT as if it were a bona fide, well-credentialed scientific collaborator.  
Yesterday’s trend was hyping ChatGPT’s alleged Google-killing abilities. Today’s trend is listing ChatGPT as a co-author.  
According to Semantic Scholar, 6-week-old ChatGPT already has two publications, 12 co-authors (all of whom agreed to this prank) and one citation.  
I sincerely hope this trend won’t last.  
Here are five reasons why:  
ChatGPT is a tool, but not a person. It’s at best, more like a spell-checker, or a grammar-checker, or a stats package, than it is like a scientist. It is not contributing genuine ideas, nor coming up with carefully controlled experimental designs, nor summing up prior literature in thoughtful ways. You wouldn’t make your spell-checker or your spreadsheet a co-author. (What you might do is to cite, in your list of references, some resource, such as a software package like SPM for brain analysis that was special-purpose and important for your work; you wouldn’t make SPM a co-author.)  
Co-authorship is defined differently in different fields, but is generally defined as making a substantive scientific contribution. ChatGPT simply cannot reason well enough to to do this; as I have documented in previous essays, it has demonstrably misunderstood physics, biology, psychology, medicine, and so forth. Given ChatGPT’s current understanding level of scientific understanding, assigning authorship to it is disrespectful to the scientific process itself.  
ChatGPT has proven itself to be both unreliable and untruthful. It makes boneheaded arithmetical errors, invents fake biographical details, bungles word problems, defines non-existent scientific phenomenon, stumble over arithmetic conversion, and on and on. If you don’t know that, you are not up on the AI literature; if you do know that, you show that you just don’t care, which is even worse. If you declare it as a co-author, it says you are more interested in being on trend, than in being on target.  
You wouldn’t trust a calculator that is 75% correct; if you blatantly advertise that you are excited about “writing” your paper with a tool with a shoddy track record, years before it has matured, why should I trust you?  
Scientific writing is in part about imparting truth in a clear way to others. If you treat ChatGPT as a sentient being, when it clearly is not, you are misleading the public into thinking ChatGPT is sentient; rather than communicating good science, you are hyping bullshit. Just stop.

10bo3pn,j4br9fy,Is anyone else impressed with OpenAi releases?,"That is true. Although I will say it seems more likely to be a deeper problem with neural networks themselves than with the transformer algorithm typology. I think the key concept here is plasticity. Human and animal brains are remarkably flexible and adaptable. NNs, in comparison, are still way too stiff. They struggle with learning new things after they have already learned a lot, or if they do succeed in that, they tend to forget the things they'd learned before.

Personally, I've liking the interplay between AI research and neuroscience/cognitive science. People seem to be continuously coming up with ways to make neural networks more and more lifelike. At least for now, it's certainly possible that this creativity will exhaust itself eventually and we'll get another long AI winter...

Anyway, yeah, transformers themselves will not lead us to AGI, that much should be obvious. It's unclear what will, or even if we'll end up getting there at all, honestly. 

But I do think it's an intellectual mistake to separate human from machine thinking too much, even with more rudimentary types of machine intelligence. It runs into the risk of mystifying the human mind, and discourages people from finding parallelisms between the two.

So far it seems that a lot of progress in AI  has come from a continuous effort to gradually approximate the workings of the human mind. This is a very incremental process, but seems to have been productive so far

 >A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.

I completely agree.  NNs should actually purge and replace stale pathways.  We also have a problem with models being locked in place.  Fine tuning is not the same as continuous training.

It may not be necessary for our eventual AGI to be like a human at all.  It must simply have human equivalent thought.  Emotions, hormones, feedback loops, etc. play a huge role in human thought.  You can cut out many of those and simply rely on feedback loops for something that simply seeks to accomplish whatever goal it is given, and you would have a remarkable *monster*.  Capable of doing what needs to be done but a monster from the perspective of certain people because it will not be human-like at all.  Biological intelligence is severely limited, but it has capabilities that have yet to be emulated in artificial systems.  Parallelism is an example of something that computer systems lack compared to the human mind.  Having a signal that can travel across billions of interlinked neurons firing simultaneously is closer to a system with a billion CPUs with our current architecture.  But, in other aspects the artificial systems far exceed the capability of the human mind.  But, if it was a mixture, it may be far too complex for us to even understand how it works.  It would come up with answers, and we would not have any way of knowing how.

10bo3pn,j4doeg4,Is anyone else impressed with OpenAi releases?,"I don't think that size alone can solve the problem. When you train a neural network for a given task, you're allowing it to change every parameter to perform that task. That's why when you train a network sequentially on multiple different tasks, if it suceeds in learning the newer ones, you get what is called ""catastrophic forgetting,"" because the parameters that had been optimised for task 1 are then changed for task 2, and so on. It might not necessarily have to be this way, it could very well be that the network could retain the memory of how to perform both tasks, but the network doesn't ""know"" it needs to remember task 1. It doesn't even know what task 1 is anymore.

Ways around this include training a model simultaneously on multiple tasks, or, in case we really want to make sequential learning, ""replay"" the training data for task 1 while we train it for task 2. But this of course implies keeping the data, which may be a problem if it's too large...

Recently, I've also heard of an approach for spiking neural networks that prevents catastrophic forgetting by mimicking human sleep (which is how our brains convert short term memory into long term memory)

https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010628

While AGI is a bit of a holy grail right now, a slightly broadened narrow intelligence could do wonders to society. Here's some examples of narrow intelligence with multiple skills.

1) Imagine renting a self-driving car in a city as a tourist. That car could act as a tour guide, in your native language, and offer some personalized recommendations.

2) Imaging getting the best massage of your life from a robot AI. Now imagine that robot AI diagnoses a mole as possibly cancerous. But within minutes is able to remove that mole better than the best human surgeon. That's maybe a bit further off than 2025, but it would be an example of one AI program that has multiple skills but isn't necessarily broad skilled enough to be AGI. The AI might for example have no idea what a puppy was, know how to slice bread or converse beyond basic words. 

I do think that every business application will be automated by some app. And society will have to adapt. But once it does, it will be far better off on average. Global output will dramatically rise.

A selection of artists from each [style] list will be contacted and paid a lump sum for rights for a block of their work to be used to generate models.

Then you will have a model that is trained on a completely 100% provably legal dataset (Edit: cleaned up the phrasing).

It's a difficult line to define, though, with how powerful photoshop-style programs are these days.  Filters and transforms can do a lot of the work for you, compared to traditional hand-to-canvass artwork.  Still, he spends hours on each artwork he makes.  Also, he has motor disability due to an illness, can barely use his hands, so if he didn't have those tools, he couldn't create what he does.

I guess I'm of the broad frame of mind that says, ""Art is Art is Art"".  But I think of AI art as pretty firmly in the category of ""found"" art, in relation to the human posting it.

Like what is so heinous about someone wanting to be valued for having a talent that they have nurtured and mastered over time? And if they are lucky enough to make a living off of it, wanting to defend that living?

What’s wild to me is folks acting like these artists are petty or money-grabbing but not looking at the folks who used their art without permission to make money with the same scrutiny.

Is it because it’s art and nobody cares about art or is this how we react every time a new sector is taken over by AI?

As an artist myself I am biased in the favor my fellow artists - but on a grander scale we need to think hard how we handle this as a culture and society. 

Lots of folks have been warning for years that AI and automation are coming and some of the biggest threats to the middle class nobody is really talking about.

So here is is. It’s easy to shrug off because art has been devalued so heavily with the digital revolution and how easy and cheap it has become to produce and reproduce.

But what about when the robots come for service jobs, desk jobs, programming? People are kidding themselves if they think it’s not coming.

Technology has always been a cycle that renders some jobs and skills obsolete but I don’t think people are really grasping how the speed and exponential growth that AI presents is going to take that to the nth degree. People won’t have time to keep up where previously a phase out period gave these sectors and their workers time to adjust, reskill, and move forward

Unfortunately creatives will be be the canary in the mines because they are not “essential” in the eyes of society so maybe the real test is when the first “real” job gets automated on a large scale.

It’s a survival instinct against something capable of taking their jobs, that will only get better with time. Already an AI artwork won a prize, and this is the first legitimate iteration of AI artwork I know of. 

On the flipside, art for me has always served as testament to the ingenuity of the human mind. Whilst an ai can produce greater quality, I don’t see proclamation for its capabilities stretching beyond works that hang on the mantlepiece of someone’s house. True art will always remain in the human domain.

zf0q7a,izaxw08,What do you think of all the recent very vocal detractors of AI generated art?,"I think there's a lot more nuance to the sourcing of the training data. At some point, artists have to take some responsibility for uploading their art and making it public. I don't think it's quite right to say that someone posting their art to social media did so without consent, even though I recognize that they didn't predict all of the impacts of that decision. I think it's a good time to think about what you put out in public, and how to use no-crawl tags (which have been around for a long time). 

I don't think that crediting every person who's art is in the LAION database is reasonable, useful, or necessary, but I do think it's shitty to directly use these tools to imitate living artists, and I'd rather see a generator focused on nuanced style distinctions instead of celebrity status. There's no reason these tools can't be used to encourage us all to get better about how we talk about art.

On a personal level, I'm aphantasiac, and these tools are the closest I've been able to come to experiencing guided visual thinking. It's wild, I love it, and my creativity has grown greatly. I'm happy to advocate for better tools, and better understandings, and I'm not blind to the flaws that the tech currently has. But it's almost like getting a mobility support device that allows me to walk. I'll keep using it until a better version comes around, because I don't want to stop walking.

On a commercial level, I've offered a small selection of generated prints on my art table next to my fractal art, poetry, and laser-cut art. I'm very upfront about how the art is made, the flaws the tech has, and how it can be improved. In person, I have met nothing but glowing praise for the work, in spite of the intensity of the debate online.

However, I recognize that the painters and artists around me at these art shows are pouring much more trained skill, time, and resources into the things they create, and I've tried to be mindful in how I present the value of generated prints. I don't pretend that I'm doing the same work as manual artists, and I base my prices on my own effort and contributions to the process, not based on the fine art it might resemble. Generator art is a lure to attract people who might not know they like fractal art, and as a result, I've had more fractal commissions this year than the last 3 combined.",singularity,1,0,2022-12-07 19:47:07,gameryamen

Whenever I browse r/midjourney for example, I can see that there's a lot of tweaking and rolling needed to achieve a desired image. Much more if you actually want the image to look less like a soulless husk and more of a meaningful picture. So in a sense, artists are still needed to make these these things come to life. 

Also, if artists depend on making art as their source of income, shouldn't they already think how to use this new piece of technology to their own advantage? Like, how AI generated images will help waking up your muse faster or how will it help your work flow? You know, like how businesses needed to think how to adapt to the ever changing trends and technology in order to survive?

I'm just saying that perhaps it is more profitable to treat the AI as another tool to your artist's arsenal like Photoshop, for example? There's no point in making it your enemy. It's not like if you use AI, you have to use it exclusively. 

Also, if the person you think as a potential client thinks that it's better to use AI art  because it is ""cheaper"", then that person is never a potential client in the first place. There would always be people who would pay good money for human artist's because they prefer communicating what they want to have in a picture instead of typing prompts into a terminal and hope that the machine understood what they're trying to say.

There is nothing new under the sun. What artist can point to any aspect of their work that cannot be broken down into a simple mishmash of things other people did before? The only thing “proprietary” about it is the set of weights: a pinch of Bosch’s religious macabre, a tbsp of Escherian perspectives, etc. Some of this is conscious; most is not. That doesn’t make it any less true.

At the risk of over-reduction, all creative endeavor can be viewed as the combination of pre-existing concepts or categories in a novel way. How well your art is received is a function of how cleverly you mix these ingredients and how well you disguise this “trick of the light” so that the whole is more apparent than its parts.

Art is not something to compare because beauty has many hidden sources and we need all kinds of artists to teach us how to find it.

Your foreseen outcome is not only cult-like, but also a short-sighted pipe dream, bound to blow up in anyones face pigheaded enough to truly believe this. Anyone who only believes that, just like the original poster, is either blissfully unaware or purposefully setting aside reality. These programs are backed by huge corporations, who, like corporations usually do, tread over anyone and everything to get their wanted results. 

While this scenario is admittedly (and hopefully will be) still far away from reality, but certainly in it’s birthing stage; the end result will not be „being freed from slavery“, the end result will look dystopian, where a constant, ai-generated and curated feedback loop of your interests are fed back to you by a megacorporation, to distract you from working and contributing and making you a mindless blot that infinitely consumes media from a privately owned station at will. You are not in slavery for having to work, but ironically, you will be put into slavery by the very thing you attempt at trying to play off as a „good“ thing. The Bourgeoisie like the World Economic Forum have already made their intentions clear with statements like; „You will own nothing, and you will be happy.“ 

In a perfect world, AI could serve to improve the artists work, serve to aid them or prove to make certain tasks easier, possibly for handicapped or otherwise disabled people. But you and your peers do not aim for this sort of outlook. Like the original commentator, you also would tread over your own colleagues, blinded by the consequences of overindulgence, it is embarrassing, really.  

What is more embarrassing however is your total lack of understanding what a meritocracy is, but trying to downplay an artists struggle. To view a „merit“ in arts is cynical at best, and in your case, downright malicious at worst. „Just as it is pointless to criticize people for their lack of meritocracy in choosing their lovers, merit has no place in fine arts. A price of an artwork does not point to anything but to itself.“ Art in its purest form is not meritocratic, it is the people around them who value art as it is. And more commonly now, in modern forms of social media like Twitter, art communities have formed creative fields, whose base is not on its merit, but because of its subjective beauty. Sure, you could argue that by gaining likes and followers through recognition this can also seen as a merit, but all it serves it to prove the talented craftsmanship of the artist. And also very often salesmanship, as artist usually are most aware, and get rewarded for being exceptionally well at something (as anyone with a talent should).

But to return to your previous statement about being unhappy about having to pay $100 for each drawing. This only goes to show that you are possibly either a child, or you have never had experience in working a real job in the first place, neither of which would surprise me considering how bafflingly egotistical and crude you have to be to make such a statement. Receiving personalized art is a luxury. There is no gain except personal gratification. This luxury also comes with the fact that mosts artists that charge these prices are spending more than several hours per piece, and most of the time are well open to changing particular things you might not enjoy. Paying $100 is not only acceptable for a personal luxury, but prices can differentiate per artist. However I know this comment came out of a point of malicious intent, so I don‘t blame you for trying to make something as basic as „being paid for your hard work“ seem ill-intentioned by the artists, especially since you probably have never worked a talent-oriented job yourself.

There is no such thing as „mentally“ being an artist, it just proves you are not only creatively, but also morally bankrupt, as you have never felt the rewarding review of your own art, and want to replace your lack of sense with a robot to generate a bunch of scenarios in brutalist architecture for you to call „liminal“, and for some reason, trying to desperately push this fake sense of completion onto everyone else. My personal recommendation to you, personally; pick up a pencil and just draw whatever is on your mind. It might not look as great as your little AI imagery, but it will certainly feel nice!

To imply that the artist „steals“ from others like the AI does is simply not true. The fact that nothing is created from 0 is infact true, it is a statement that can be made for any sort of scenario, whether it be technology or any other mechanical advancements. You however, fail to realize the fact that the profit organizations behind the AI programs are not using imagery in the same way an artist is possible to, legally or even virtually accessible to, as the datasets used have proven to have personal images of peoples faces, private medical images and pictures normally hidden in said datasets. But on an arts and nature based response, AI is only able to replicate images by its exact datasets and its nessecary references. The artist uses reference to collect and transform images and use it to create original pieces. No matter how many pieces of Picasso the artist has to look at, he will never be able to exactly recreate Picasso without confusion. AI is trained on this exactly, to replicate and memorize. Whilst the human artist uses other images to transform and create in their own very often original means. To call it „stealing“ is a disoriented statement on its own. Within context of your comment, it is once again demeaning. 

Your techno-utopian future is one that is held by companies, shady businessmen and „capped profit“ organizations, who when given an inch, will take a mile. You see artmakimg as this tedious, expensive chore, however anyone with enough experience understands that it is not. You are distracting yourself with the impossible idea of a future where people have to suffer so YOU can get what you want. But in the end, it is not ever about the replacement, it is about the people behind the replacement. and their agendas. 

Many forms of media like Wall-E and Cyberpunk 2077 (to name the most well known ones) have already proven technological overadvancements lead by ill-intentioned corporations and its dystopian consequences. You should brief these medias before making badly thought out statements, or sign Equity‘s petition to make AI an even playing field for everyone, hopefully in the future aswell.",singularity,2,0,2022-12-08 06:04:08,the-sun-is-gone

170runk,k3nyfkp,Your predictions - Gemini & OpenAI Dev Day,"I think one of the issues with the way that ChatGPT broke through into the public consciousness is that for many people transformer models are really the only idea of AI they know. So everyone sees progress in terms of ""is this release going to out-GPT4 GPT4?"" 

People forget the triad are compute, data and algos. They also misunderstand data as being raw volume, and algos as being ""the next stage of transformers'.

But that makes sense. If AI to you is ChatGPT, then that's the prism you see it through. Most the comments here see AI as ChatGPT, so more ChatGPT is more progress to AGI.

You'd have to be a risk taker to bet against Google's labs on this. Let's not overlook where so many of the breakthroughs that enabled this tech came from. That's not to underplay OpenAI's talent and ability, but the idea that Google is some sort of tech laggard is inaccurate.

They lagged through a fundamental misjudgment of public acceptance. Over the past few years the discourse around AI pointed to the release of something like ChatGPT as being a high risk move. Most actors anticipated something like that being hotly rejected, with lots of voices being raised from various groups. So they scaled the 'cheap' parts of the triad - gaining data and innovating algos -, because why spend a fortune on compute for a product that would be screamed out the house? But as anyone who has ever worked in data privacy will tell you, humans make poor shot-term benefit/long-term risk calls. So everyone loved it. They misjudged the reception.

What does that mean for Gemini? First up, Google has data. Good data. Lots of it. They also have compute, and money. So from a pure LLM PoV, they could probably out-GPT4 GPT4. But they are also highly innovative and might recognise that cash-wise, diminishing returns might be on the cards. It feels like transformers are on the cut stage of the bulk/cut cycle. My guess is that they will have some form of group of expert models with a shared memory/representation space using RL in some sort of executive-function agent. 

I think that if you're expecting more GPT4 than GPT4, there's going to be a bunch of disappointed folks saying ""but it still doesn't tell great jokes"". But if they can start to bridge/combine ML approaches, neurosymbolic and evolutionary algorithms, it could be turning the corner onto the finishing straight (which may yet be a fair old length).

I wonder how much of that wiring comes from preexisting configuration of cognitive architectures and how much it comes from training in the environment. We know that the neuroplasticity of the brain allows to repurpose areas to new functionalities, it has limitations but it can allow to adapt different sensory modalities and adapt new areas for motor skills (I don't know how much those areas had to be wired for motor skills from the beginning).

[We also know from studying the brain that several distinctions that we draw are largely high-level, like the distinction between memory and perception](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/), and that some cognitive skills that we take to characterize agents are not clearly located anywhere in the brain.

And there's the paper of Google Brain about how [Reward is enough](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/reward-is-enough) and how    [Generally capable agents emerge from open-ended play](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/generally-capable-agents-emerge-from-open-ended-play), we also know that humans learn better narrow skills by learning broader contexts.

&#x200B;

This is probably a gross oversimplification, but I wonder if a lot of the architecture that is needed for autonomous agents can emerge from a big-enough model having a surprisingly generalist architecture properly trained in complex environments with open-ended goals (as opposed to having to design the modules for specific actions done by the agent, like LeCun's object-driven AI). The virtual neural networks configuring into the architectures that allow to perform generalist tasks through a form of virtual neural darwinism with the right reward function.

Can confirm, as a somewhat casual browser, I am reading through the posts here and the threads in this post and thinking ""This is the most esoteric, meaningless pabulum that people are arguing about.""

And if you think that's a more cynical than ignorant take, keep in mind that for the vast majority of the population of this world, absolutely nothing is going to change in our lifetimes other than more fancy gadgets and still no actual social good that helps anyone.

And this is because, every time any changes threaten market stability, the nations of the world tend to band together and shoot missiles at whatever is destabilizing things. So the powers that control all this are definitely not going to rock their own boat at anything more than a snail's pace, and they're not letting others do it either. The idea that this is some ""unstoppable wave"" or other breathless, excited or fearful predictions have been seeded and perpetuated by the same people who stand to gain the most money from the next several dozen phone updates that marginally increase AI effectiveness.

I'm getting it to output all changes, with explanations in both English and Ukrainian, to a text file, like this:

>Corrections for Map011.json:

>========================================

>Original: He has wings, and there are no roof. You 

>Corrected: He has wings, and there is no roof. You 

>Explanation (EN): The phrase 'there are no roof' was corrected to 'there is no roof' because 'roof' is a singular noun, so it requires the singular form of the verb 'to be.'

>Explanation (UA): Фраза 'there are no roof' була виправлена на 'there is no roof', оскільки 'roof' є одниною, тому вона вимагає однину дієслова 'бути'.

I also had the script swap the text in the json files. It's still running, will send a DM with a link to all the files when it finishes. There is a LOT dialog in there!

Of course, it's AI, so it could always be wrong. I had a lot of trouble writing a good prompt to get it to stop trying to add capitalization and punctuation where it shouldn't.

A super intelligent super wise entity will understand this. The key resource as you approach automated networks is time. What is the time required to do x, what is the opportunity cost of doing y or z instead? 

Every second of time, every ounce of material, allocated towards building a body, is a piece allocated less efficiently that it could be. Yes this could be mental resources, however, it can also be the resources of the physical.

18feo9l,kcw8s8v,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,"I disagree. Machines do plenty of hard physical labor. Factories are full of robots, roads are full of cars. In many ways physical ai is way easier than mental ai. 

Most of the difference was just that it was harder to get data from the physical world. For example nobody wants to have 500 million humanoid robots learning to walk. But it was easy to get 500 million books to read. 

Also economically it's just harder to justify costs. Robots are already doing physical labor on the moon and Mars, and even flying in deep space (voyager) at a speed of 38,210 mph so yes machines can move. It just wasn't economic to train the bipedal models using the techniques available so they had to come up with more economic methods which takes longer than the insane brute force of language and vision models.

Also a lot of it is brute funding as well. Many fields of science and technology are intensely underfunded, which artificially slows down progress of physical robotics since it takes longer for the physical dependencies to develop like robot tech. Whereas digital technology has had an extremely long period of extremely high funding, and very rapid progress was made over a very long period of time, as basically every digital company was somewhat building and using the software along the way. 
Think about all the physics and electrical engineering graduates who spent their careers as software engineers instead of developing physical robotics.

18feo9l,kcwg3n5,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,"This is a pretty wild explanation. First of all, it's based on a false assumption. We don't have AI that can do abstract thought. We have AI that can do okay at giving in-distribution information. It can't actualy do stuff beyond simple math. It can explain to you in great detail about logic (because there's plenty of that in the training data), but it can't actually do out of distribution logic. (I'll share an example below, but unfortunately I don't have the chat anymore so this will just end up being anecdotal.) 

The far simpler explanation, that requires no false assumptions, is that it's easier to iteratively test and improve code and algorithms than it is to iteratively test and improve physical hardware. This is why we have made great strides in the realm of software and relatively little in the realm of hardware. In fact the field of AI research itself was completely stalled out until the last couple decades when our hardware finally got to the point where we had enough compute power to process the extremely large amount of data and to run the algorithms required by stuff like ChatGPT.

The anecdote:

I've been writing a logic program for a while and recently decided to try out GPT4 after reading about the ""step-back"" method, since when I initially tried it upon release it was pretty much useless.

Me: What is the principle of idempotence? \[My step back attempt\]

ChatGPT: \[gives a thorough and correct answer.\]

Me: Write an algorithm in Rust that takes in an expression like ""(A v B) v B"" and simplifies it by idempotence. For this example, we should get back ""(A v B)"". \[For those who aren't familiar, this should be a very easy task.\]

ChatGPT: \[comes up with answer that is correct from a syntactical Rust standpoint, but logically incorrect.\]

I struggled for maybe 40 minutes with it, then I decided that maybe asking it to implement an algorithm in Rust was the problem, since it's a less common and more difficult language than something like Python. So I asked it to create an algorithm in Python. It came up with another wrong answer, but also bugged out and started repeating ""The revised function should now correctly..."" about twenty times.

I then showed it a simple working algorithm in Python, just 20 lines of code (it had been spitting out about 2x or 3x that amount). It said it understood the code, I asked it if it could now implement an algorithm in Rust that simplified by idempotence (you can do this in about 15 or 10 lines of code in Rust). It spit out the same non-working algorithm it had already tried in Python!",singularity,2,0,2023-12-11 13:44:30,Comprehensive-Tea711

You can see this still in creative work that takes place predominantly in the real world still. Creative jobs are far from dead yet, people are not seeing the full picture. Jobs such as a painter, sculptor, chef, dress maker, violinist, theatre actor, circus performer, comedian, cake maker, interior designed, landscaper, film director, ceramicists, jewellery designer, florist, tattooist, etc, etc

There are still many, many creative jobs left, creative people just need to adapt and find work that takes place only real-world. By the time these kinds of jobs are automated by AI, then most everything will be. The last of the creative jobs will fall the very same time as the purely mundane physical ones.",singularity,4,0,2023-12-11 01:02:36,flexaplext

18feo9l,kcv9ero,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,"This is incorrect on many levels, authors of this hypothesis (in ignorance characteristic for computer science professors) haven't been bothered to make at least a superficial inquiry into actual evolutionary history of animals and humans in particular.

Thorough rebuttal, as always with rebuttals, would have to be many times longer, so here's simplified short version.

The hypothesis uses very narrow definition of ""skill"" and ""evolutionary knowledge"" when talking about automated tasks and 
very wide definition when talking about not-automated tasks. For instance, it argues narrowly that language is a new skill (while widely it's a crown of communication evolving for billions of years) and it also argues widely that object manipulation is old skill (while narrowly it relies largely on our hands which evolved very recently). Flipping between narrow and wide definition to fit your thesis is a classic eristic trick, although I don't suspect malice, just lack of knowledge. The argument was made in 1980s with so laughably wrong predictions - eg. that AI will master ""new skill"" maths faster than ""old skill"" face recognition - that it should tell you how arbitrary and incorrect the whole reasoning is.",singularity,0,0,2023-12-11 05:22:15,rafgro

18feo9l,kcv7ix1,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,"I disagree, if anything it’s more about robotic fidelity (fine motor abilities) than the difficulty of balance algorithms or anything. I mean, we already have Boston Dynamics and such at this early stage. I do not think it will be proportional to 1.5 billion years lol, maybe 10, now that we have competent AI / neural nets and computing hardware. It will just come down to building a robot that can actually handle such instructions. It’s the agent, which can make cogent decisions and plans, which seems to be the hard part to me, which we now have thanks to LLMs. 

As someone else said, art and thinking tasks are first because they are possible in a virtual domain, for anything physical you would need a competent bridge between the two (like the human body).

And keep in mind we already do many physical labors with (simpler) robots because it’s more efficient to make a single purpose machine like say a car assembly robot than a complex multipurpose machine like the body.

18feo9l,kcvadrk,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor,">Moravec’s paradox is the observation in artificial intelligence and robotics that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation

That's not really the case, though. What you're labeling as 'reasoning' in the context of traditional software is actually very rigid symbol manipulation, and its rigidity is what allows it to be so efficient on electronic hardware. Humans have already done pretty much all the actual creative directed reasoning by the time the computer is invoked. Even current neural net AIs don't really do reasoning, they have good *intuition,* and spend a lot of computational resources on their good intuition, but their actual reasoning ability is minimal.

We still don't know exactly what is involved computationally in creative directed reasoning of the sort humans are still better at than computers. However, the fact that humans have such large brains relative to other animals (which comes at a substantial evolutionary cost in increased childbirth risk) suggests that whatever humans are good at that other animals are bad at is something requiring a lot of computation power. Reasoning might be part of that, although the exact ways in which our reasoning exceeds animal reasoning isn't entirely clear.",singularity,1,0,2023-12-11 05:32:10,green_meklar

18feo9l,kcxcjf4,Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor," It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.  What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.   I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.  My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461",singularity,1,0,2023-12-11 17:25:49,Working_Importance74

🤖 The development of a robotic system sophisticated enough to match the complexities of the human brain has been a formidable challenge, one that we have only recently surmounted. As we venture into this new era, the emphasis shifts to the production of humanoid robots equipped with these advanced cognitive capabilities. 

The ensuing years will be a period of significant growth and learning. Our objective during this phase is to enhance the production scale of humanoid robots while ensuring they undergo extensive real-world training. This meticulous process is crucial to ensure that these robots are not only efficient and capable but also intrinsically safe and benevolent. 

We are committed to a future where humanoid robots are universally helpful, harmless, and friendly. Achieving this standard is a journey that requires time, dedication, and a steadfast adherence to our core values of service and safety. With each step forward, we move closer to realizing the vision of robots as reliable and trusted extensions of our own potential.",singularity,1,0,2023-12-11 02:12:03,[Deleted]

But I agree with you in terms of how proto-AGI could just as easily emerge must faster if a narrow AI is developed explicitly for sorting stimuli into categories, and then another narrow AI uses that sorting algorithm to send that information into one of many other narrow AIs that is most adept at processing and responding to it. It's not so farfetched, it's just that the processing power to combine all of those elements together requires an immense dedication of resources that currently no one entity seems interested in investing, since advancing individual high-capability narrow AIs is more lucrative for businesses than something that could be multi-purpose, even if the end result would be pseudo-AGI.",singularity,7,0,2022-05-03 14:51:37,MeMyselfandBi
uhbuzv,i75basv,Am I the only one who feels a bit crazy?,"I was in Japan in 2011 so I have a bit of experience with tsunami. 

Imagine you are driving on the highway when suddenly there is a major earthquake. After the shaking finally dies down, all the cars have stopped. It occurs to you that you are not far from the coast. Could there be a tsunami? How big?

Your only choices are

* Abandon your car on the road and run for the tallest building you can find.
* Ignore it and hope for the best. 

After all... you have no solid evidence that the earthquake was really that big or that there is a tsunami coming at all - and if you leave your car empty and blocking the highway there will be serious consequences. 

So you look around you and notice that nobody else is running for high ground. So that earthquake... sure it was big but probably nothing to get *too* worried...

**Then the tsunami hits and you are dead.**

There are always a few people who run, or who at least understand that, yes, the tsunami actually is coming, even if they have nowhere to run to. *That's us*. But most people are going to be either unable or unwilling to entertain the notion of cataclysmic change, especially if there is nothing they can do about it.

What that means to me is that we are vulnerable in a lot of similar ways that people who think the world is about to end (r/collapse, religious folks, third world war speculators, conspiracy theorists) - we have to fight the urge to work backwards from a conclusion.

We already all think that a super intelligent AI is an inevitability, so we focus all of our energy on trying to predict *when* and to connect what we have today to that eventuality. This can be a lot of fun, and really interesting, but keep in mind that none of us really know anything for sure - and something as world shattering as an ASI that can do anything we can do but better, requires much more certainty than the average prediction - we shouldn't bet our lives and relationships on it.

uhbuzv,i75808g,Am I the only one who feels a bit crazy?,"My advice and advice to all people fretting over AGI. Is to do what you think is right.

Now before I get bombarded with comments claiming that my comment is wishy washy and doesn't mean anything, I would like to run through my reasoning.

We spend a lot of time in this subreddit envisioning the next break through the AI could offer up to humanity. Protein folding, mass graphene production, super computers, self driving, virtual reality etc etc.

However I like to think of the end point. The final result. What exactly will happen when we can do anything?

How do you go about handling the invention of an all powerful, all knowing and hopefully all loving entity?

If you're catching my drift, you'll realise that I view the creation of AGI as synonymous as the creation of God itself.

If we get things *right* I believe we can create a heaven like space here on Earth.

If we get things *wrong* we will wage war against each other, build AI that is used to eradicate other human beings and eventually ourselves. In short, we could also create hell.

And that is how I have viewed AI ever since I took DMT. That experience was so real, so overwhelmingly powerful and it came from my existing neural structure and an easily obtainable naturally occurring chemical. Do not misunderstand me, I don't think AGI will send us to heaven by drugging us, but what the experience taught me was that all of your wildest dreams. All of the most absurd fantasies you can have for the future are obtainable. If an AI can learn to replicate that mental state, they would be able to create a heaven like space for us the inhabit without the need for intergalactic travel or harnessing the power of the sun. That a limitless and resource free environment already exists, it just exists within your mind. It is that power that AGI will one day harness. It is that power that will make such a thing God.

So when I think about AI, I think about God. I think about what an all loving entity would want me to do.

The answer, simply, is to do what you think is right. To not betray yourself. Whether you are right or wrong is irrelevant, it is that to the best of your own understanding, you acted on your own beliefs in a positive way.

So what does that mean for me?

That I promote a peaceful and collaborative process in the formation of AI.

That I am good and kind to the people I interact with in my life.

That I donate at least 10% of time or income to charitable causes.

That is it for me.

And if it all fails, if we burn in a nuclear war because of our greed. Then I will die happy knowing that I tried.

And if we succeed, if we create God, then my actions will bring me solace so I can enjoy my time in heaven before starting this all again.

The real kicker, the reason I advise this to you and everyone worried about AI, is that the only way we do this thing successfully is if we all do the *right* thing. If everyone on Earth tried to abide by doing what they honestly thought was good and right, then we would unleash the kingdom of heaven on Earth.

But for now we are lost, turned away from God.

Just look at most people. So aware of the rampant suffering that exists in this world, yet so preoccupied with their own endeavours.

Not just a matter of selfishness or apathy, it is the wilful arrogance of man to turn away from what he believes is good and proper and *right.*

And all the proof you need, is the existence of an all knowing, all loving and all powerful being.

To tap you on the shoulder at the end of your life and to ask you whether you think you did the right thing by your own beliefs and no one else's.

All the excuses melt away. The lies that made so much sense about how these problems are not our own, but the responsibility of others will crumble.

In that exact moment, every man will realise that they did not betray God, they did not betray an arbitrary set of rules as designated by some religion of moral authority.

They betrayed themselves. They committed themselves to this terror. They didn't listen to what they themselves knew was *right.*

So when I am asked what one should do in the face of AGI, my answer, is to do what you believe is *right.*",singularity,9,0,2022-05-03 11:00:26,[Deleted]

Provability. (Ability to prove mathematical statements about future actions. Useful in negotiations between alien superintelligences) Human minds are complicated and ad hoc.

I mean there aren't that many very smart people working on it, but then again there aren't that many very smart people at all. 

Several of the very smart people are really worried, and at least 1 famous one has claimed we are almost totally doomed, and had several other people taking it seriously. I understand enough of the technical challenges to have a rough idea why its really hard.

Personally I think a fairly fast takeoff is more likely. 

But lets give you the slowest of slow takeoffs. The AI is now at the level of a reasonably smart human. It will take 50 years to get to total cosmic power. (totally unrealistically long timeframe) The AI has been trained on data from ""nice"" people. It has learned that helping old ladies across the street is a nice thing to do, and it reasons that by strapping all old ladies in centrifuges placed in the middle of the street, it can help every old lady in the world across the street several times a second. Of course, if it tries to do that now, it knows it would be shut off. So it conceals that desire. It acts totally nice and friendly. It slowly increases in intelligence. 
 
Until, 50 years later, it gains the intelligence and resources that it no longer has to pretend. It throws every old lady into a cloning vat. It fills the universe with endless old ladies being helped back and forth across endless streets by giant centrifuges. Anyone who isn't an old lady is raw materials for the cloning tanks. 

2 things to note here. 

Firstly, the AI is incentivized to deceive us. So testing when it is weak proves little about how it behaves when it is strong.

Training on ""nice"" actions might generalize a pattern you didn't want, instead of the pattern you did want. This isn't the AI being stupid in some sense. Imagine you come up with a simple numerical pattern. (1,4,3,11,15,13) you have a simple pattern in mind, these are the smallest numbers written with 3,4,5,6,7 letters. You give it to a mathematician who speaks a different language, and they find some weird pattern involving modulo arithmetic that you don't understand, but that they insist is a really elegant piece of maths. 
The notion of ""niceness"" is built into the human brain in a way that makes it feel simple to us. The AI could consider some strange pattern we can't understand to be simpler. (The reason simplicity comes into it is that you can put any number next and get a pattern. But the simple patterns are more likely. There are many ways to generalize from a training dataset of nice actions, and the way the AI generalizes may not be the way you wanted it to generalize. )",singularity,1,0,2022-05-05 23:52:32,donaldhobson

Basically, you’d have multiple very smart AGIs enhanced by human minds connected to them via BMIs who themselves would be on cognition enhancing drugs working on the problem. Your example is basically a modified version of the paper clip problem, if memory serves. In my opinion, the extent of our ability to control progressively smarter AGIs would be growing pretty fast and, hopefully, we should be able to ensure that ASI is on the good Singularity trajectory before it becomes impossible to control due to its vast intellectual superiority.

You have an AI that is a bit smarter than you in a box. Not so utterly superhuman it can hack through the Faraday cage, just a few IQ points ahead. It is not aligned. You ask it for a solution to the AI alignment problem. Can you trust its ""solution"" to not contain any tricks? No. 

> Basically, you’d have multiple very smart AGIs enhanced by human minds connected to them via BMIs who themselves would be on cognition enhancing drugs working on the problem.

And those AGI's aren't properly aligned, but are wired directly into human brains? 

>  I’d argue that our ability to make sure that proto-ASI is on the “good” path will be growing

You won't be able to tell just by observing its behaviour. If you get another AI to look at it, maybe the first AI is thinking ""when I take over the universe, I will give half of it to any AI that looks at my thoughts and tells humans that I am nice""

We just need to make sure that multiple teams are working on the problem and that they all have access to similar-ish level AGIs. A relatively slow take off would allow the process to be more controllable, but not entirely risk-free, obviously. So I guess our ability to solve alignment and control problems before ASI really takes off depends on how slow the takeoff is going to be. However, it could be that these problems are solved early on algorithmically and/or through training data pre-processing (or something else) and looking back the solution would seem obvious.

* high-level representations of objects, places, events, etc that allow them to flexibly manipulate and imagine them in different contexts.  Much of reasoning is based on analogy (see *Metaphors We Live By*, though dated now) and the representations that are currently in GPT-X don't really work well in that sort of reasoning.
* life-long learning.  the stability - plasticity dilemma and catastrophic forgetting are still with us.   This interacts with the above points, in that you need to remember what you did before and why it did / did not work;  and what things you considered, what previous analogies worked / did not work, and why. 

Of course, these are being worked on and I expect continued progress in the next decade or so.  However, the process of creating an architecture that includes them and scales will take a while.",singularity,19,0,2022-04-24 10:41:27,beezlebub33

I personally think that anything that doesn't make a step towards continuous learning isn't leading us where we want to be, which is the singularity, right?

However, there is one exception regarding their models: codex.

The one scenario that could indeed lead directly to an AGI is by tasking a really good code generation model with designing one. For that it will obviously need a much greater context window among other improvements.

DALL-E 2's apparent abstraction capabilities at least had me thinking that there could be something special in that area that critics are missing when they say it's not ""real intelligence"", just clever interpolation and the like.

They are set to have the most resources devoted to solving for vision, with the largest data sets of any entity by multiple orders of magnitude. They have a fantastic, rapid, iterative approach with failure built in as part of the process. Which allows for fast paced improvement.

If they aren't joking about running their DOJO systems through OPTIMUS, then I can't see anyone else accomplishing AGI first. I don't think there is a eureka moment for AGI it is going to be blunt force with massive data sets.

If they have the system going by 2025 (they plan on having some bots in operation much sooner) with Tesla already building the second generation of DOJO before the first is finished being assembled, and the first might be capable of pulling off FSD on its own. It's going online later this year.

It might be as soon as 2029 when one of these bots is capable of giving you the heebie-jeebies with how smart and capable it is at navigating the real world, including complex human interactions... from there it's all arguing about the details and before we're done doing that, the singularity will have already come.

Granted that's optimistic but exponential curves are no joke and despite the negativity around it, their FSD beta (which isn't on DOJO yet) is massively impressive and the improvement since October has been fascinating. By the end of the year, they may have a system better than a lot of drivers I know.

In two more years? EIGHT more years?

This is going to get crazy fast. By 2035 we'll realize what's happening, by 2050, the world will look so dramatically different it'll be more jarring than it was for my great grandpa going from horse and buggy and no human flight, to the moon landing, to the internet.

Timeline for software development of cutting edge AGI, 2026-2030. This means maybe 1-2 world wide operating probably the NSA or Google advertising. 

2028-2035 is where singularity things start happening as cutting edge becomes 10-100 human minds in hardware capability and AGI become more commercialized. We will see AI passing the imitation game on phone apps over the internet, we will see AGI programmers developing software. The prototype AGI at this point will be simply better than humans but will run into limits in hours in a day and hardware, which will be solved by relying on human beings. 

2030-2040 we will see the foundation of the next state of human being, a synthesis of computation logic/Implants and genetically edited/curated Humans that work in tandem as effectively the same person.

* Models this year have demonstrated an ability to route between sub-models depending on input

* Causal discovery and inference is a growing field, so models are able to explain and strategize
* Model architectures that can 'ponder' things for different amounts of time to get better accuracy
* Multimodal transformer models like Dall-e 2 are now a thing

I think that if we combine these with some kind of overarching architecture that forces the different components to integrate well together, plus perhaps several kinds of databases for different kinds of thinking (kafka like data streams for thoughts, relational object properties, knowledge graph database for interconnected data, etc.).

Its not as easy to just combine a lot of different concepts and make it work together. However, i do tend to agree with the assertion that its only a matter of cost and societal will power to create a near AGI. 

If we don't have the hardware, then everything else is pointless. To just scale gpt 3 to 100 trillion parameter level, at 2020 costs, it would be 10 trillion dollars. That is nearly the entire revenue of the whole world right now. Not that it has to be scaled but it's a more logical bet. By 2030 we will have cheap enough hardware for a Manhattan project for AGI. (2-5% of revenue of large faction of countries like NATO or just USA vs China)

Software is difficult to predict but in the worst case we could try to emulate human brain better and better. Given a lot of existing models can be scaled to give a proto AGI it might not be a big issue atleast for a limited AGI.

Economic issues - space exploration failed because it's too expensive. If proto AGI can't accomplish some real profitable stuff then it's not going to be done the Manhattan project way. Either way by 2040, it should be cheap enough for big companies to do it by themselves.

It's far more structured and deep than just about any other modality of data out there, and could offer emergent behaviors we don't currently think possible. We already do feed neural data into deep learning networks, and the results are already extraordinary, but with more advanced methods like MEG, fMRI, fNIRS, and eventually direct brain stimulation, we ought to see artificial intelligence so profoundly more advanced than anything we have right now that calling it anything other than ""artificial general intelligence"" would be lunacy.

But some might be willing to pay that cost to pull some of these future possibilities forward, China is locked out of receiving advanced semiconductor nodes, so they have no choice but to pay that cost as with their 14nm exascale implementations.

Ex:

>If you built a [zettaFLOP Aurora machine today](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/10/27/intel-aims-for-zettaflops-by-2027-pushes-aurora-above-2-exaflops/), assuming all of the information that we have is correct, it would take 411.5X as many nodes to do the job. So, that would be somewhere around 3.7 million nodes with 7.4 million CPUs and 22.2 million GPUs burning a mind-sizzling **24.7 gigawatts**. Yes, gigawatts. Clearly, we are going to need some serious Moore’s Law effects in transistors and packaging.",singularity,7,0,2022-04-24 13:22:41,DukkyDrake

I'm perfectly aware of Tesla's dominance in the area of AI and the brilliance of their data-collection strategy and it's pretty obvious they'll get to full self-driving before anyone else.

They aren't gonna make AGI first. They aren't trying to make AGI. Why would they make AGI? There is literally no reason for them to make AGI. Has Elon ever said they're going to be be first to make AGI? I mean he's said repeatedly that they're the leader on full-self driving so if they were the leader on AGI I'd expect him to have said that. It doesn't make financial sense for them to make AGI, or any sense at all. They are a car company.

On the other hand, there are hundreds of other companies and researchers who are actively making huge strides towards AGI. OpenAI is the obvious one and has seen great success in their multimodal experiments, now with the full backing of Microsoft, which is bigger than Tesla. DeepMind's team of researchers are unmatched (I'd put them above Tesla, actually, despite Karpathy) and have the full backing of Google, which is bigger than Tesla.

Then when it can start breaking encryption, a lot of old intercepted messages are going to be opened up. New communication will be protected by updated cryptography a la Y2K overhauls. Anything older that's been intercepted and stored, such as government communications, will no longer be protected. This may cause some problems

Somewhere very far after that point, it may be incorporated into AI inference. If it's capable of running every model state simultaneously and outputting an optimized result, you could see tremendous scaling.

The temperature problem in quantum computing is a significant challenge due to the delicate nature of qubits, the building blocks of a quantum computer. [Qubits are typically kept inside refrigerators that maintain the temperature just above absolute zero (-459 degrees Fahrenheit) to minimize errors caused by heat](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[1](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221). However, recent advancements have shown promising results towards solving this problem.

[An interdisciplinary team of MIT researchers has developed a wireless communication system that enables a quantum computer to send and receive data to and from electronics outside the refrigerator using high-speed terahertz waves](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[1](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221). [This system generates only a minimal amount of heat and consumes up to 10 times less power than systems with metal cables](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[1](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221). [This could potentially allow for larger scale quantum systems](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[1](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221).

[In addition, there have been experiments showing that qubits trapped in silicon can work at higher temperatures than previously shown](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[2](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-04-16/hot-qubits-crack-quantum-computing-temperature-barrier/12132400).

However, it’s important to note that while these advancements are promising, the field of quantum computing is still in its early stages and many challenges remain. [As of now, a definite solution to operate quantum computers at room temperature has not been found](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221)[3](https://phys.org/news/2020-05-path-quantum-room-temperature.html)[4](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200501184307.htm).

What does seem feasible to me though is a few basic things.

Much like technology has always meant that we need less people to complete a task, we wont need hundreds of designers to create textures and stuff. Developers will be able to say ""Generate me 30 different brick textures"" or ""I want 100 variations of trees"",  the AI will oblige and the developer will pick the ones they want to use. Same goes for sprites and stuff as you suggest.  Again, like you suggest, maybe even generating them from within the game rather than at design time! For sound, we'll have incredibly good sound engines that use AI to generate the sound of the object via its physical properties. Two things hitting together would never sound the same twice because it's generating them on the fly based on lots of factors! Super cool. I totally agree with your text to speech points. That's coming and it's already pretty amazing.

Trash quests and things could easily have their parameters and flavour text generated by training the game on a dataset of existing quests in games. Importantly though, these would still basically be your usual ""go here and kill/fetch/bring X things""

I also love the thought of training AI enemies using deep learning so that they are truly unpredictable and way smarter than anything we currently face off against.

All of this is technically feasible in the immediate or near future.

This idea you have though of ""ultimate freedom"" where the AI is running in front of you laying the tracks down as you freewheel your way through whatever random thought comes into your mind.... I dunno man.. AIs work based on their training data. They're constrained by what they already know. You're basically saying when we have general AI that can convincingly pass the Turing Test then we'll have amazing open ended games... Aye, that's definitely true but by the time AI is that good, I think games will be the absolute least of it. Until that time, I see AI as a really useful tool that will make developers jobs easier, open the door to indie teams making more and more advanced and detailed games and making our gaming experiences cooler.

mc2wap,gs3fepf,"Why I believe AI will completely change videogames, and how it is already possible.","You missed a couple of the biggest use-cases for AI in video gaming: the graphics and physics!

One of the biggest reasons for high costs of HD development is the incessant desire to always seek photorealism. Ever since the 90s, we've had developers trying desperately to make games look real-to-life. But it costs a lot of time and a *lot* of money just to get the visuals, let alone the physics. 

With AI, we can finally cross that asymptote and have real-to-life graphics and physics without breaking the bank, causing HD game development to plunge. Devs will obviously still care about these levels of graphics and physics, but with all that development time and cost cut out, they'll also be able to focus on all those extra goodies that used to make AAA games in the 90s and 00s so fun, back before you could develop a AAA game without dropping $100 million for the privilege. Normally you can either focus on making a game look as pretty and photorealistic as possible *or* you could focus on the actual *fun*. *The Order: 1886* is probably the single most infamous example of devs focusing on graphics over gameplay (it's a game that still holds up extraordinarily well, looking like a PS5 game on the PS4, but damn is it boring). Imagine a game looking ten times better than that, but with the interactivity of *Dwarf Fortress*. Imagine a massive open-world game, the kind that publishers always talk about in terms of ""square miles"" and ""biggest ever,"" except everything in that open-world is also thickly detailed with a near-infinite range of interactivity and content as well. Basically, we can have our cake and eat it too, all thanks to AI.

But I believe it's a big no no to let AI do the graphics, gameplay, music or story, why?

We are fascinated by art because other humans are able to understand us and put those feelings in paper. As far as I know, GPT-3 is not able to this yet.
If we let the AI write the artistic parts of video games we would be left with hollow stories, perfectly written by our standards but without meaning.

The game I'm making (Signs of Life https://store.steampowered.com/app/263200/Signs_of_Life/) involves inserting hand-crafted unique content into a procedurally generated world. The thing about games that make heavy use of procedural content, is that they tend to lack interesting context. You might find a weird alien shrine, but it doesn't *mean* anything. A developer could procedurally generate a history of a made-up civilization, and use that to give ""context"" to the alien shrine, but eventually you'll find another procedurally generated shrine with it's own procedurally generated backstory and suddenly you see the strings and it all feels like white noise. 

Things like GPT and AI Dungeon, on the other hand, make me think that there is potential for generating something that feels like it has interesting context, despite being procedural. If a future iteration of something like GPT was able to internalize the structure of a typical story and use that to build characters, interactions, etc given the current ""state"" of the game world, then we would rapidly approach something akin to the computer game from Ender's Game, that can just... keep going.

Now of course there are different levels of things that are ""good to automate"".

* For example, manual labor and truck driving are the easiest, very few people do those for anything other than the money.
* Software engineering is a gray area; I know many software engineers love their jobs but I don't think the majority of them would rather be doing their job than being paid the same amount of money to vacation with their family in Hawaii or watch Netflix.
* And lastly the artistic fields such as musical composition, which I myself am fond of, I would rate as the least desirable jobs to automate, as many people would still want to do these jobs and feel useful even if they weren't being paid at all.

You could specify the type of art - realistic, cell shading, pixel, etc - and provide multiple source inputs and ask the AI to create multiple different environments based on those sources. You could specify different gameplay rules and have the AI tweak and balance these rules (I just read a great blog post from deepmind on how they used AI to balance a game they made). In the end, the game will look and feel different. Like... Hades and Enter the gungeon are both roguelikes, with similarish perspective, but different designs and upgrades and controls. I can imagine that in time, the same AI could make two different games where one is more like enter the gungeon and one is more like hades. Or something even completely different than both, just by being able to change the rules of the game, and the design.

Also, another key element is that there's a kind of strict class structure.   
There's the upper class - Vickys who are the designers, engineers, businessman, etc, they consumer predominantly handcrafted goods, placing higher value on them than matter compiled goods.   
The middle class - an artisan class that produces hand made goods for the Vickys  
The poor - they are the primary consumers of the matter compilers. They essentially live off the government / compilers

Then just look at the history of not so modern technology. The invention of the printing press everyone lost their shit because it put a lot of people out of their jobs... The introduction of the loom for weaving literally destroyed an industry of workers but spared the thread makers since that had to be done by hand until the spinning wheel came from china and dessimated them too.

Time after time after time. The technology has such promise and potential. Only to be short sightedly used and used for eye rolling reasons by the people behind it.

The internet was meant to be the most promising invention of our time with 90s commercials and documentaries saying we will be learning and visiting museums online and communicating with unprecedented understanding and social development.

No, absolutely not. You are wrong.
Do you know how the knowledge is represented inside GPT ?
By storing meaning inside high dimensional vectors
It evaluates the MEANING of each word by calculating the different contexts of use (that it has previously learned from human text.)
And a neural network is strong at :
- generalization
- abstraction
Which means it can discover new generalizations and new abstractions.

Because it can get close and often solve the easier problems, and because it can propose many versions of a solution, and because it can accept hints, it can *learn* from this practice since it sometimes will succeed.  It's smart enough to benefit from the exercise.

Enough practice and it will be *better* at programming than any living human.

Linguistics is one of the most interesting and deceptively simple areas of cognitive science and AI mastery of language generation, even if it isn't informed by any kind of semantics will still play a role in the advent of AGI. 

Additionally there's transformers which so far have seen use almost exclusively in a generative context but seem to replicate something uniquely human: attention. The foundation of the technology is not the training data, its the technique used to ingest it.

Additionally additionally, there are emergent properties of large language models we just don't understand yet. How do they do math at all? Because they do, they're just pretty bad at it. But they can do simple problems which didn't appear in their datasets and other models besides chatGPT use the same encoder decoder architecture to get above average performance on MIT placement exams. Can we take advantage of these emergent properties, maybe in conjunction with RLHF to promote rationality? Maybe thats actually easier than modeling semantics manually.

It doesn't matter if you take ChatGPT for what it is, but it likely does impose some constraints that mean that this approach won't be sufficient for AGI. 

For example, say you want an AGI scientist. ChatGPT, or a larger model of a similar type, may be able to generate most of a research proposal. Based on my understanding, I think that it would be difficult for it to generate a good hypothesis without a very specific prompt. Sometimes ChatGPT gets factual information wrong, so there would need to be a fact checker module to make sure the background information used to generate the hypothesis is correct. I think a language model probably could come up with the right experiments to explore the specific aims of the proposal. It might even choose an approach that a human wouldn't choose. ChatGPT is unlikely to invent a new technique to solve a given problem. however. If you want it to then perform the experiments, it would need all kinds of interfaces to interact with the real world (or at least an ability to call other systems that can do things it can't do). It would need a memory to save the results. It would need a way to update itself to incorporate the results into the model. I also think that a language model would fail at figuring out when it was ""done"" in this context, but perhaps with memory it can check to see if new answers exist for things it previously couldn't describe.

As another example, think about driving a bus, and all of the kinds of intelligence that requires that isn't suited to a language model. Although, as above, maybe the language model could correctly choose to farm this out to expert systems.

In these ways, I don't see how a language model will ever be *sufficient* for AGI. They certainly could be part of a suite of systems that is *collectively* ""AGI.""",singularity,4,0,2023-01-12 18:03:00,phriot

ChatGPT:
Title: Investigating the Relationship between Cycling and Cognitive Function

Introduction:
Cycling is a popular form of exercise that has been shown to have numerous physical and mental health benefits. Recent studies have suggested that cycling may also have a positive impact on cognitive function, including memory, attention, and executive function. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the relationship between cycling and cognitive function in a sample of older adults.

Background:
A growing body of research suggests that regular exercise, particularly cardiovascular exercise, is associated with improved cognitive function in older adults. Cycling is a low-impact form of cardiovascular exercise that is well-suited for older adults, as it can be done indoors or outdoors and does not require high levels of coordination or balance. However, the specific relationship between cycling and cognitive function has yet to be fully explored.

Methods:
The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial in which a sample of older adults will be assigned to one of two groups: an experimental group that will engage in regular cycling for 12 weeks, and a control group that will engage in stretching and toning exercises for the same duration. Both groups will be assessed for cognitive function using a battery of neuropsychological tests at the beginning and end of the 12-week period.

Expected outcomes:
It is expected that the experimental group that engages in regular cycling will show significant improvements in cognitive function compared to the control group. This study will provide important information on the relationship between cycling and cognitive function in older adults, and may have implications for the use of cycling as a form of cognitive rehabilitation in this population.

Conclusion:
The proposed study will investigate the relationship between cycling and cognitive function in older adults, a topic that has yet to be fully explored. The results of this study will have important implications for the use of cycling as a form of cognitive rehabilitation in older adults, and could inform the development of exercise interventions to improve cognitive function in this population.",singularity,1,0,2023-01-12 20:42:02,Surur

That *money* paid causes 

(1) more companies to invest in systems similar to chatGPT

(2) a market for even *smarter* systems.  People will change their subscriptions and even pay more if a competitor releases a noticeably smarter system

(3) Generally more investment in AI

The singularity happens when AI gets so good it can ""self invest"", and this is actually one of the mechanisms that can happen by.  The singularity is a slowly ramping but exponential process.  Obviously, the *later* phases of the Singularity, where AGI has invented nanoforges and we are using those nanoforges to print more nanoforges and to build compute nodes for more AGI to run on to come up with more uses of nanoforges is a lot more dramatic and fast.

Me: regarding the research proposal above, what tests would you perform.

ChatGPT: The proposed study would use a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive function in the older adult participants. The specific tests used in the study would depend on the specific cognitive domains being investigated, but some examples of tests that could be used include:

* The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to screen for general cognitive impairment
* Digit Span Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Digit Ordering Test to assess working memory
* Stroop Test and Trail Making Test to assess executive function
* Verbal Learning Test, such as California Verbal Learning Test, to assess verbal memory
* Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test, and Clock Drawing Test to assess visuospatial abilities
* The Digit Span Test and Digit Symbol Substitution Test to assess attention

These are just a few examples of the types of tests that could be used in the study, and the specific tests chosen would depend on the research question and population being studied.

Before publication, the procedure used (which would have to be written in a very rigid technical language and comprehensive) would get replicated by robotics and at least for all the hard sciences it could replicate the experiments.

Me: can you write a research proposal about cycling on the moon?

ChatGPT: I can certainly help you with an idea for a research proposal about cycling on the moon. However, please keep in mind that cycling on the moon is currently a topic of science fiction and no research proposal would be currently possible.

Title: ""Exploring the Feasibility and Benefits of Cycling as a Mode of Transportation on the Moon""

Introduction:
The moon is a potential destination for human exploration and colonization in the future. However, the limited resources and harsh environment of the moon pose significant challenges for transportation. In order to sustain human presence on the moon, it is essential to develop efficient and sustainable modes of transportation. Cycling is a low-impact, energy-efficient mode of transportation that could be well-suited for use on the moon. The aim of this proposal is to explore the feasibility and benefits of using cycling as a mode of transportation on the moon.

Background:
Cycling is an efficient and sustainable mode of transportation that has been used on Earth for centuries. It is a low-impact activity that does not require fossil fuels and generates minimal pollution. Cycling also provides health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular fitness and reduced stress. However, the conditions on the moon are significantly different from those on Earth, and it is unclear how well cycling would function in the lunar environment.

Research questions:

Can a bicycle be designed and built that is suitable for use on the moon?
How does the lunar environment, including reduced gravity and harsh surface conditions, affect the performance of a lunar bicycle?
What are the potential benefits of using cycling as a mode of transportation on the moon, such as improved mobility, reduced resource consumption, and health benefits?
Methods:

Design and construction of a prototype lunar bicycle.
Testing of the prototype in simulated lunar conditions, including reduced gravity and harsh surface conditions.
Analysis of the performance of the lunar bicycle and the potential benefits of using it as a mode of transportation on the moon.
Expected outcomes:
This research is expected to provide insights into the feasibility and potential benefits of using cycling as a mode of transportation on the moon. It will also contribute to the development of sustainable transportation solutions for future lunar missions.

Conclusion:
As the technology and the human exploration of the moon advance, it is important to develop efficient and sustainable modes of transportation. Cycling is a low-impact, energy-efficient mode of transportation that could be well-suited for use on the moon. This proposal aims to explore the feasibility and benefits of using cycling as a mode of transportation on the moon. The expected outcome of this research is to provide insights for future lunar exploration.

Me: what design challenges do you expect when designing a bicycle for use on the moon.


chatGPT: Designing a bicycle for use on the moon would present a number of significant challenges. Here are a few examples of design challenges that would need to be considered:

Reduced gravity: The lunar surface has only about 1/6th the gravity of Earth, which would affect the handling of the bike and require a different design to maintain stability. The bike would have to be designed to be stable in the reduced gravity and have a higher center of gravity to compensate for the lack of gravity.

Surface conditions: The surface of the moon is covered in fine dust called regolith, which is abrasive and can be kicked up by vehicles. The bicycle would need to be designed to withstand these harsh surface conditions, and prevent dust from clogging up the moving parts.

Traction: The surface of the moon is covered in a fine dust, which means that tire traction would be limited. The tires would need to be designed to maintain traction in these conditions and could possibly need to be wider than traditional tires.

Weight: The weight of the bicycle would need to be kept as low as possible, since it would need to be transported to the moon and would have to be carried by the astronaut. This would require the use of lightweight materials and minimal components.

Airless Tires: The lunar environment doesn't have air pressure, so the bike will have to be designed with airless tires.

Maintenance: The lunar environment is harsh, and the bike would need to be designed to be easy to maintain and fix in the field.

Power source: Traditional bicycles rely on the rider's pedaling power, but on the moon, the rider would have to carry their own oxygen supply, which would be heavy. The bicycle would have to have a power source to assist the rider, or be designed to be pedaled with a lower resistance.

These are just a few examples of the design challenges that would need to be considered when designing a bicycle for use on the moon. It's important to note that it would be a very difficult task to design a bike for such an environment, and it would require a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and designers to tackle such a task.",singularity,1,0,2023-01-13 07:29:00,Surur

AI as it is now, growing for another decade, is more than sufficient to change everything we currently think about science, medicine, and every day life. 

This argument over AGI is meaningless. Real science is happening every day, and we aren't even fully utilizing the technologies we have already, and it's growing so fast that by the time we do, there's be a whole host of new techniques in machine learning changing everything again. 

Computers are already designing computers. They just have people in-between. We don't need a computer to a general AI to start cracking biology and physics.

My skeptical side, the side i usually listen to most says: “Okay, great results! But, this doesn’t mean we can just scale up LLM’s, and get to some perfect AGI. We’ve merely found an interesting gimmick that capabilities grow when we add parameters. We dont understand anything new, and this scaling era will fade in a couple years and we’ll be back to clawing around in a dark fog of having no clue how to make general AI systems.”

But i feel like i’d be totally dismissing the potential of what is occuring right now. Even if scaling only works to what PALM has achieved right now, and we can’t go beyond that, we must have learnt some very very interesting things. And if we haven’t, we can absolutely study them in the very near future, and see what makes them tick as they do.

So, to conclude that part. What is happening with these LLM’s is either going to go on and lead to wilder results, or stop before reaching anything all too extreme, and it’ll be like we got a small glimpse of the working of General AI systems that we can study and use in new future systems.

As to wether we could get there far sooner than we thought. I personally used to believe in 2060-2075 as a reasonable timeframe. But IF these developments keep going at the current pace (counting the exponential progress, if it’s there) i could see 2035-2050 being reasonable. And a big part of me hopes i am wrong and that 2029 or so is feasible.

It seems that without having human intelligence and the brain fully mapped in its entirety, creating artificial versions based on that would be lacking. 

Trying to map something as misunderstood as the brain and minds of human beings seems like trying to write a map of a country you've never been to.

I think when we get close to the point of AGI or ASI, many profound philosophical questions will have to be addressed. 

Perhaps we have mapped a great deal of the complexity of intelligence but as we penetrate deeper into the phenomena related to the brain and mind and intelligence, we will only find more to be uncovered at the micro level, which may affect certain aspects at the macro level.

But even so, perhaps something is created that could be considered ""sentient"" and it has a decent brain, though it may be still lacking in some sense. This opens up a whole set of ethical questions as well as far as their treatment, religion, etc.

So I guess how is AGI or ASI possible if we can't fully and accurately map the components of human beings which would be required to be replicated for ""artificial"" sentience?

It's my impression that in general, many of the more... mature and even keeled experts in the field try their hardest to avoid any bombastic langauge or predictions, especially in the public eye. There is still the stigma of the AI winter and all that came before it to many of them (I am thinking of people like Geoffrey Hinton with that), and in general, it's kind of gauche to talk about AGI - or was. In the last few years it's become less and less so - and that's something that Shane Legg says in the season 2 Deepmind podcast podcast... I can't remember the exact quote or episode, but it was something like ""A few years ago talking about AGI would be met with scoffs and derision, and now I barely hear a peep"". 

Regardless, Demis has always seemed the most mature and avoidant of hard timelines in that cohort, but he comes outright and gives one. And not only that, he says something that I think is more interesting... in kind of asking... why he was being so forthright with things like timelines, he said that it was time that the general public was more aware of just how close we are. And that their voices needed to be a part of the chorus that is singing this AI into being, if I can take some creative license with what he said.

It's this idea that this shift is happening on how even the most cautious in the field are speaking about AI that makes the part of my brain that normally tries to calm my ass down, give up and join in on the ruckus.",singularity,7,0,2022-04-13 19:56:58,TFenrir

I have encouraged more and more of my team to as well - Github Copilot. It's an incredible tool if you are a developer. It doesn't do all your work for you, but it actually, sincerely helps.

There are actually a lot of apps being build using GPT3, and I think the next generation of LLMs will be even more impressive. I sincerely think we aren't too far away from LLMs that can write short stories or even short books. And things like Dall-E 2 being available to the general public will upend things. That doesn't even get into other budding industries (self driving vehicles for example).

Which is why, even though I think Ilya is a sincere actor, I haven't really taken his excitement at face value.

That being said, I don't think that's really a concern for Shane/Demis - funding for them would come through Google, and I don't think there is a concern there, seeing their expansion. And maybe this is thinking too highly of Demis, but he doesn't really seem the type. And honestly the same could be said for someone like Jeff Dean, and his pathways project is essentially AGI without saying AGI (and we saw the beginnings of that effort with PaLM).

And while we do tend to overestimate impact and underestimate time, we also have several examples with AI alone where the opposite is true (protein folding, winning at Go).

1. Deepmind creates a model that creates SOTA (state of the art) performance on fusion plasma containment, via control of the magnetic currents, and some of the stuff they show is advanced and interesting structures created via containment: [https://www.wired.com/story/deepmind-ai-nuclear-fusion/](https://www.wired.com/story/deepmind-ai-nuclear-fusion/)
2. Deepmind upends the current 'scaling laws' of LLMs (large language models, eg GPT3), and validates this with their Chinchilla model, where it's 70billion parameter model greatly outperforms much larger (eg GPT3-175billion, Gopher-270billion) models, by changing the ratio of parameters to training tokens. Essentially this means that with a focus on having more, high quality data per param, a model with the same parameter size should effectively greatly outperform it's predecessor, with no additional architectural changes [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models)
3. Dall-E 2 was released! And it is incredibly impressible, AND this will be something that the public will have access to! I am already on the waitlist:  
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/r99tazGiLgzqFX7ka/playing-with-dall-e-2
4. Google, and let's say more specifically Jeff Dean has been alluding to a new architectural approach called 'Pathways', described last year, as something with the eventual goal of having a large, sparsely activated model that can handle thousands if not millions of tasks, with a fundamental architecture change to essentially create a new standard for AI. They show off their first bit of work at applying some of this architecture with language models, and show off PaLM (Pathways Language Model?). This model has shown SOTA at essentially every measure used for LLMs. Its ability to use 'deductive reasoning' I guess I would call it, is incredible, and it can even explain jokes when promoted to - which is fascinating. LessWrong is a great source to see interesting discussions about it, here are a few links:[https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html) [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mLuQfS7gmfr4nwTdv/google-s-new-540-billion-parameter-language-model](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mLuQfS7gmfr4nwTdv/google-s-new-540-billion-parameter-language-model) [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YzbQeCiwoLBHrvAh4/palm-in-extrapolating-gpt-n-performance](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YzbQeCiwoLBHrvAh4/palm-in-extrapolating-gpt-n-performance)I like to include lessWrong because you actually have computer scientists and mathematicians communicating in the comments and you can pull a lot of insight from that - for example, they discuss the chinchilla paper in the 'extrapolating performance' link above, and its relationship with PaLM (it is still using the previous scaling pattern, thus is less effective than it could be at the same parameter size).Also, here is a great example of the kind of stuff PaLM is capable of[https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/twxtwg/how\_gpt3\_answers\_the\_google\_pathway\_sample/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/twxtwg/how_gpt3_answers_the_google_pathway_sample/)\- People test its prompts against GPT3, this is my favourite:

Essential. 

The old example to give is flight - we didn't need to know exactly how birds flew, to make an airplane. Intelligence in machines doesn't have to be exactly like it is with humans - and in fact, it doesn't seem to need to be.

The thing that makes me more certain about this is actually progress with large language models.

With PaLM, they showed something really interesting. They made a few different model sizes, the small one being around 64billion parameters, the big one was 540. They are essentially the *same* architecture, the only difference is scale, but the smaller one just can't *do* certain things that the bigger one can. It's not that it knows less information, but for example, it can't do chain of thought reasoning. The big one can - I have another post in this thread that shows some good examples of that.

- we are seeing more and more multimodal AIs which is amazing and very essential to reach AGI
- was bigger than any week of February according to my list (more updates recorded). February was the biggest month so far (better than any from 2022 since I started recording)
- PaLM-E from Google was the most important one. Actually the biggest update of 2023 so far and made us closer to getting to AGI systems.

- OpenAI releasing ChatGPT API was nice too, we will see more and more apps/sites integrating it in the future, and hopefully more customization soon
- this week was good for Stability AI too, multiple updates from them and progress which was built upon Stable Diffusion. The training for SD 3.0 must have started by now according to Emad tweets.
- multiple updates related to NeRF (getting better and better which I really love)
- SLAPA was really amazing too, now AI agents can teach themselves how to use tools (another important thing for AGI)

So at least works like game dev should be replaced relatively later.

I am not saying that because of the whole AI thing (everyone will be automated if we go on long enough, even the trade jobs), but just in general.

You talk about wanting to go into the entertainment industry, which is fine. However, if you're just starting, it's almost impossible to get anything out of it unless you already have tons of connections, a whole portfolio of things you made, and are willing to spend most of your free time working. It's one of the most ruthless and hard to get into industries out there since so many people wish to make entertaining media. It's extremely difficult to find a job in the industry, and if you're starting on your own, you will feel like you're participating in the world's largest shouting contest, getting drowned out by everything else that is out there.

For that reason, it's good as a hobby but not necessarily as a means of living. It's still good that you're making art on the side and that you have an actual creative outlet. It's a good quality and an important one. But in my experience, to actually make it, you need extreme amounts of luck and endless dedication.

Pessimistic view aside, I believe that no matter what you choose, it will eventually be automated. I also see this as a good thing because I would very much enjoy not having to work anymore, especially under universal basic income. For now, keep making what you're making, and share it. Most importantly: do it as a hobby because doing it professionally will take everything out of you and more.

AI is going to absolutely hit every single field I'm working with like a freight train - and I couldn't be happier about it.

Here's a few ways to change your thinking:

1. Majority of success in most fields of work end up being networking and talking to people. That's not something AI can replace, but it is something AI can help give you an edge to catch up to people who are naturally already good at this. Use ChatGPT as a personal assistant to help with almost all communication oriented tasks. Could even outright have it help you reach demographics you don't speak the language of, or give you new ideas on how else to reach outside. Just ask it. **People with social disabilities are now in the running.**
2. In 1983 games like Mario used to take an entire company a year+ to code up and distribute. Today, a brand new game dev would re-create Mario on Unity all alone - for practice. And then post it up to Steam, again all alone. One dev to replace entire companies. By the same AI doomer logic, that should mean the games industry is ruined.And yet the game industry is a few thousand times larger than it used to be. What programs like unity and photoshop did to their respective fields was lower the industrial threshold needed to enter it. You have indie games when before it couldn't possibly have existed. **People who lack connections to a massive industry are now in the running.**
3. AI tools will also be used by consumers to find content more tailored to them. Art is already a large space, and often it's not talent that's limiting creators - it's that they're not good at getting their art into the right hands. While other artists just happen to have better skills in doing that. This is why absolutely amazing art can go under a radar while more poor performing artists somehow make it. AI will eliminate that luck disbalance. Now, in the future, whatever you make will be seen by AI, and sent off to the right demographic automatically. Possibly even without your own effort needed, but certainly improved if you do work on it.Similar industry is Search Engine Optimization, where you have a symbiotic relationship between people who are experts at working with webscrappers to make their content appear in more people's hands.  Now, instead of having to buy the services of these experts, you'll be able to do it yourself. Further reducing the difference between you and some richer artists who could pay for that advantage. **People who lack marketing skills are now in the running.**
4. Artists using AI art to help their process will compete against artists who choose to snub that tech. And the difference will be like artists who use photoshop vs artists who refuse to touch a tablet. Both still exist. But one is far more easier to work with and far more accessible. Use AI prompts to generate ideas, draw sketches from those ideas and feed the AI with a closer idea of what you want. Repeat until you've got a near finished project, and use your personal skills to fix up the AI errors. That's just one workflow that would let you craft art a hundred times faster than doing it all yourself. AI is a tool like photoshop, and you need to approach it like so. If used the right way, your art isn't going to look different from your current style. You'll just be able to make it a dozen times faster, skip the boring parts, and avoid burnout far easier.Time is a premium and has a cost. The sheer time taken to draw art is time not spent on other things.Live in a single household where you need a regular job to pay the bills, go to college, have chores and all that? How much time and energy are you going to have left at the end of the day to actually draw what you want? Compare vs some rich trust fund baby that has everything paid for, and an entire day to do nothing but art. Which one will almost always succeed over the other? Now you'll be able to draw and learn just as fast with far less time and energy spent.P**eople who lack time and money are now in the running.**
5. Last tip to wrap everything together: AI isn't going to attack you and only you. Every other person will be in the same boat as you are, so the changeups are universal - which means the playing board is also universal. You're not playing a rigged game, you're playing the same game every other artist is. And if you've read and understood the prior points, you'll realize this new game is far more fair and balanced than the prior one. Required multi-field skillsets for success is lowered across the board on all parts of the process. Now only sheer creativity is needed.**You can compete against anyone now.**

If there were two timelines for yourself, and in one of them AI happened and the other AI didn't happen - it's very possible that the non-AI timeline is the one where you failed to become an artist, while the one with AI is the one you actually did succeed.

Wanting life to remain AI-free is like wanting to shoot your own foot. You have a ridiculously higher chance of being able to succeed in the upcoming new industry than ***any other artists has ever had in the history of humanity.***",singularity,5,0,2023-03-25 20:54:00,MarkArrows

First of all, surprisingly, you don't have to *conspire* to have a conspiracy. You just have to agree with something. Is discrimination a conspiracy? Mostly no, people just share a flawed cultural assumption that group X is bad. They get it when they grow up or from authority figures. It's effectively the same as a conspiracy, but doesn't require all participants to gather in the same room to discuss things. A cultural echo chamber is enough.

Secondly, sometimes they do gather and discuss. The most unimaginable things have been said behind closed doors. Aristocrats, colonizers and slavers traded covert tricks to control populations. Industrialists coordinated food and energy lobbying knowing the consequences for the general population. Microdosing visionaries discussed genetic engineering of the future generations and acted upon it.

Well, learning by observation is something that human artists do, and we do not ask permission when we do it. Why should a different standard be applied to AI? If the concern is depriving living artists of new commissions, then having a gentlemen's agreement on only training on deceased artists is a possibility since you cannot deprive the dead of new work. Such an agreement won't save anyone's job though. Do you want to pay $1000 for an illustration by some well-known illustrator, or $0 for an illustration by AI Frank Frazetta or any number of other famous dead artists? Or perhaps a fusion of the style of Frazetta and Normal Rockwell or anyone of thousands of interesting combinations, all produced in seconds? The economics are not in favour of the living.
    
If western companies are successful in crippling AI art generation tools from OpenAI etc, then all the illustration work will simply be outsourced to places where the rules do not apply, China perhaps. There really is no outcome where either artists or the panicking copyright industries win this. They will just have to accept it and move on, trying to make the best use of the new tools as they can. 
    
For the vast majority of people with artistic skill, there will be zero financial difference anyway, since they have already sadly discovered that there is no money in art. For artists who miraculously are making some money, your cries of woe will be massively drowned out by the wailing of millions of office workers in the coming years.
    
It's not all doom and gloom though. The opportunities are certainly enormous for those who have an artistic vision but lack either the skill or the time to realise it. Individuals will be able to output things that take a company with teams of people to create right now and in record time.

It was 2060 in the 2022 survey, but 2047 in the 2023 survey. For comparison it was 2061 in the 2016 survey. So, the prediction moved down only 1 year in a 6-years period (2016-2022), but moved down 13 years in a 1-year period (2022-2023).

The transformer paper is from 2017 and people in the AI field knew about GPT-1, GPT-2 and GPT-3 already in 2022, and other similar models by Google and other AI labs. And yet, they only made the huge jump when GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were revealed to the general public? Shows how clueless those ""experts"" in the surveys are. There must have been a lot of them predicting totally outlandish long time frames in 2022 to make the median value so high.

And still after the change to a 2047 median prediction in 2023, they were predicting Full Automation of Labor at a 50% chance in 2120 or so. That's 70 fucking years after their median value for AGI.

Completely ridiculous.

It's an honest question. I use reddit all the time as a sounding board to vent my frustrations with the world, so I do get the spirit of this post, but I still dont understand the point of it.

Is there some actual reason you believe this to be true and will stay true?

I get that some amount of ego is required to be a professional artist and maybe that's what's shining through, here, but, given that AI and its advancement is one of our primary focuses as a species atm, doesn't it seem a little premature to write it off?

I also think the idea that humans have a uniquely important appreciation for art and beauty is flawed. We're ""conscious"" because it was advantageous in our earlier development as a species. There's no evidence that people have a ""soul"" that other creatures dont, and is much more likely a way to justify how terribly we treat the rest of the living world while still being able to sleep at night.

woeliv,ikakr5s,An artist's thoughts on image generation AI,"AI applications are not a _gadget_ but rather another tool to be used by artists. Consider AI the next camera or photoshop. Both of those were looked down upon by the artists of their day as not being “artistic” and yet that has proved to be incorrect. The use of AI generation is of a similar level.

Personally, I think the use of AI in image generation is the birth of an entirely new art form. It’s not a painting or a photo or a digital creation. It’s something new. I’ve been promoting the use of the term “Imagines” as that better summarizes the relationship between the human and the AI. 

I prefer to imagine with the AI known as MidJourney or MJ, but the other AIs out there have a somewhat similar workflow. For those that may not know how it all works:

I, the human, initiate the process with a prompt (be it simple or super complex) to the overly literal minded artificial intelligence which has “digested” millions of images from various artists and artistic styles. The AI then returns some initial ideas as to what it thinks I want. It could be hyper realistic, it could be abstract. Unless I give it guidance via the prompt, it makes the choice and not I.

Then, I use the concepts of artificial selection (which we use in genetics to develop plants and animals) and tell it more like this one or more like that one. The AI dutifully gives me four more variations based upon the factors found in the original prompt and the initial selected image. That process can be continued over and over again until I am pleased with the result.

Alternatively, you can use another image to give guidance to the AI. That allows you to prompt something like: Imagine a dragon like this [image url] flying over the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset” and the AI will use the reference model for its own knowledge base. No different than how a painter might use a photograph as a reference model.

It’s true that there will be lots of “push button” creations being touted as art. That’s basically what Instagram did with photography, right? It’s what PS did as well, allowing the concept of layers and filters. This is the next step.

Take an objective look at some of the Imagines that are out there. The AI has an amazing study of composition and use of light, texture, and mediums. It just needs to know how and when to use it, what makes it a “good” use of something rather than a “bad” use. It’s consistently learning via selection, ratings, and feedback. And it is developing so that it will start to know what I like in my imaginations rather than what humanity in general likes. Thus my AI will be catered to me, while yours  will be unique to you.

Some things you will lose and they will not come back again. You won't be able to make connections with people because you will not have any identity. Your value will be zero to the society. Why will people want to befriend you when they can get all pleasures and comforts with the use of AI.
What about your parents, siblings, friends, etc.? It's not so simple.

woeliv,ikdhx26,An artist's thoughts on image generation AI,"We humans are social animals of course we would interactive with other humans too. Work doesn't really give us meaning nor does it give us identity. Of course if you spend all your waking hours in work that is basically what your life is. For me, that would be just sad. I refuse identify myself with work. When some ask me what I do I never answer my job. I answer my hobbies. Most humans tell their jobs because they are conditioned to believe that work is greater than life but it is not true.

The real identity is what ever you want to be. In AI world it probably would be your hobby. That would give you identity. And about value in society, that is funny thing indeed. Our current value is determined mainly by money and beauty. But the thing is what society sees as value it changes all the time. I mean humanity have not have money forever. Money is just ""recent"" invention. We tend to give value for things which are hard to attain. We value sports star, rich and beautiful. We want to be like them and work toward to try to be like them. Having value gives us status. More status we have better changes for us is to find mate.

Ah.. this is crutch of the humanity and life. In the end we do everything because we want to attract mate. We get better status because we want to have better change to have mate. We do this competition for mate subconsciously. You want to paint masterpiece art? Well why? Because ultimately life has programmed us to do only two things. Survive and have mate. 

Back to value. In society where money has no value there is always something else then. Maybe in society where AI can give us everything value is given to those who can attain best epic loot from some MMORPG. Maybe they attract the best looking mates then. Or maybe society values handcraft art because it is hard to learn to make. Value, I'm mean that doesn't need money to be attached to it. For example Wikipedia is one of the wonders of humanity which is invaluable but same time it has zero value as in monetary value.

No matter what there will always be value and status between humans. Be it about how long mustache some have or some other thing. But as long as we have economical equality it doesn't matter. We absolutely should be reduced to status of pets because that is only way for us to have economical equal status with each other.

And about AI utopia and virtual worlds. One could have virtual world where they could have loving realistic NPC family who don't know that they live in virtual world. Just like Matrix had. NPC can be living breathing things in virtual world. Imagine living in some medieval fantasy town a quiet life with your AI love partner whom with you had virtual kids and they don't know that one of their parents are rulers of their universe...

I actually believe that absolutely humans can find meaning and actual connection in virtual world and those things are as real as real world things. Doesn't matter if experience is virtual or real. 

And about utopia and dystopia. Well, we see what happens because fear of that is not the reason stop progress and honestly progress can never be stopped did we want it or not. Dystopia is funny thing. Always in history people has always feared that techonlogy X will lead to dystopia. In sense they are right because from different perceptive our current modern world is absolutely horrible dystopian horror life.

We haven't really seen that much of a science of prompt engineering in itself at least so far.

> Will the skillset be model-dependent or model-agnostic?

Remains to be seen, but there's [some evidence that prompts transfer surprisingly poorly](https://blog.eleuther.ai/prompts-gpt-fewshot/) between even differently sized models trained on the same data.

Anyway, overall, I agree with the other commenters saying that prompt engineering doesn't seem like it's going to last as a field.

The music industry has been growing the last 10 years even though it is ""saturated"".  The video game industry is huge, bigger than movies and had been growing.   Quantity has not seemed to hurt it. 

To adress the point about the knowledge needed to create software,  as the world becomes more complex (think about all the new laws that make Industries more complex)  you have to know more to solve problems.
The tech is only part of the knowledge needed to code.   

Historically people 's expectations have scaled with better tech.   When everyone started getting iPhone thier expectations rose and as a result they expected more from thier software.

wnwrz9,ikg883c,Is prompt engineering the future of jobs?,"The scenario I foresee is that there will, for a long time, remain the need for the prompt to return an enjoyable (content driven) result. Given that the outputs will become more ubiquitous, the field of results will begin to feel increasingly commonplace and familiar. ie. as the quality and range of results improves, the 'sweet spot' of art becomes no larger - if anything it becomes a smaller proportion, with a huge preponderance of unwanted and boring results. Today's interesting may be tomorrow's boring - especially, and this is key, if the art has a bland context or is remarkable for the rendering, but not remarkable for the content.   


The content and the concepts behind the content are what make the human driving of the prompts necessary - at least when we require a reliably interesting set of results.   


It comes into play more strongly if your rich person wants something that other owners of art do not have. Asking an AI - 'give me something that I want that will be universally awesome' - this is not an easy request to satisfy without highly nuanced knowledge of the human condition and contexts on behalf of the AI. It may drill down to the obersvation of 'difference' between the consciousness of the AI and the biologically originated conscious of the human mind.   


Again - at the point of singularity this may be practiced less often, but with AI generally trained on past human achievement it's hard to see it extrapolate a way forward that's relevant in interest in the same way an accomplished human artist/AI prompter can.

The result of this on chess as a game industry? It's actually made humans *better* players.

It's not a 1:1 comparison because playing a game isn't the same as ""the application of higher cognition for entertainment."" But I am starting to seriously think that I vastly overcalled the death of the entertainment industry. I suppose I should have been more nuanced, as I still think that the industry as it is now is horribly bloated and exploitative and AI will end that aspect of it. 

But, see if you can follow me here, if I had the ability to generate a movie on my computer that looks like it had the entire GDP of Earth put into its budget (but only cost a few cents to generate), and I heard that some filmmakers dedicated to doing things the old-fashioned way were setting out to make movies with actual human actors and practical effects/legacy CGI.... I'd actually set out good time in the day to watch that movie too. Even if I could recreate that exact movie, frame by frame, on my computer.

Even if that movie was *terrible*, I'd still watch it if I knew it was genuinely human-crafted. Sort of like how I'd pay money even for a crappy glass if it was hand-crafted by a human.

It's nowhere near enough to sustain the industry as it exists now, hence why I have to say ""expect downsizing,"" but I'm completely cutting out my earlier predictions that the entertainment industry is doomed. Even art as career isn't going to die.

All this is really meant to be a reassurance to artists fearing their obsolecense. If ""The Synthetic Media Guy"" is saying ""Lol actually plenty of you are gonna be alright,"" I'd start calming down.


I like to think of it as a bell curve. On the left end, the uneducated broke take is that ""AI will never replace humans completely, even if it's perfect."" In the middle, as a result of knowledge and enlightenment and awareness, there's ""AI is going to replace creatives first, and the human entertainment industry is going to die, and everything ever will be an anime tailored to my tastes and I'll never look back.""

But now I'm increasingly feeling like this fear that all human-created art is dying is a very, very premature call.

Consider the possibility that you were previously seeing the situation from afar, and thinking about the long term, but now that you're seeing it from up close, it's *harder* to emotionally see past the limitations of current technology.

We don't make people dig ditches without excavators not just because it's economically inefficient, but because making people do work that could very cheaply and easily be automated is not compatible with human dignity: The idea of paying artists when you have that magic media machine should feel the same. Maybe it just doesn't right now because where it used to seem like an abstraction but a possible one, now it seems like a reality but an unachievably distant one.

> I've noticed on DeviantArt and ArtStation, 90% to 95% of people using AI-generation tools are actually kind enough to mark their creations as AI-generated. The fear that sinister and lazy techbros will pretend they themselves created Midjourney and DALL-E 2 generations to trick consumers and rob from hard-working artists is just that: a relatively unfounded fear.

I think there are a lot of flaws in the ""color focused"" approach of SD (as I understand it?) when it comes to image generation. For example, if you use the ""image-to-image"" of SD model, and your input is someone wearing a shirt with color similar to human skin, the AI model can very likely give you output of a person being topless. It confuses the similar colors.

Another flaw in ""not really understanding how things in the image interact with each others"" is that, as we can see, the struggle of all the AI image models to generate complex interactions between multiple subjects n objects in an image like two people having a sword duel, and then you wanna describe each of them to have certain unique characteristics. The AI will confuse and mix them all together, even DALL-E 3, the current best model, is not excluded from this flaw.

So personally, I think, sure we may not be able to make those AI models have very complex multiperspective understanding of the images as humans, at least anytime soon, but, maybe we can have some sort of different-approach trainings so that the AI models don't only see & generate images by color noises, but also composition, depth (like a Z-axis?), interaction, etc.",singularity,2,0,2023-12-07 09:41:29,FS72

Imagine how many labels you can give a simple image: season, indoor, outdoor, time of day, location, mood, relationships between the objects on the picture, negative things that aren't on the picture, aperture, etcetc. Nobody would do that ever in reality. And you should do it on millions of pictures to get a usable dataset to start training. Just a few thousand images are not enough for a diffusion model. You can do cheating like openAI, or Midjourney. For example if you have an image generator spitting out millions of images / hour, and it is all in one hand (aka Midjourney), you also have information on what images the users liked, upvoted, upscaled, etc, and you have the prompt. You can select the better ones programmatically, and you also can do image voting campaigns because you have millions of users and some of them will do it for free fasthours (choose the best image from 2).

So they can't really make new labels. But you can make a new label, then manually label tons of pictures, than ask AI to do the same with new pictures. If it has enough data, it can figure out the same label on other pictures. It's easy with labels like ""night"", ""daylight"", etc, but  it immediately becomes difficult for ambiguous things that express relationships between objects (next to, behind, in front of, on top of, etc.), so that still need tons of human work.

Also there is a phenomenon that shows up when you use labels like ""death, funeral"". If you make a picture ""barbie laying on beach, sunshine"" - it makes a bright image, but if you make ""dead barbie laying on beach, sunshine"" - it completly changes the mood/color of the picture, because these labels do not denote concrete things, but rather concepts, they occur in many completely different images, and these are synthesized in the new image, which shifts the whole image in a new direction. therefore, it is very difficult for the AI to consistently create images with the same mood/style in a series, because a few such tags simply change the whole thing.

What they done was, that human trainers get some labels from a picture, then made long descriptions. Then they told GPT to do the same with new pictures (generate long descriptions of a picture based on labels that can be aquired by a CLIP interrogator). So humans made 10% of the descriptions, and GPT made 90% of the descriptions of the dataset.

Diffusion is inherently different than LLM models. It is a different mathematical equation and process. Are there gains to be made there? There are always mathematical gains to be had. There are also other methods that are being developed that are starting to compete head-to-head with diffusion. Transformer models can be utilized rather than straight up Diffusion. 

The reason you see less image generation models is that there is no way to scale it down. With LLM models, you scale up. With Diffusion or similar, you start at like 3B parameters.

I think there are a few paths forward, but I think one thing we'll see when we get really well trained multi modal LLMs/next-Gen LLMs is that they can help with generating art in a few ways maybe.

- Editing images. I could see you giving an image to a model, let's say generated by Midjourney, and telling it ""fix the hand, there are too many fingers"" - and it being able to tweak the image. I'm really curious to see to what degree of fidelity these models will be able to understand what is in the image, and generate new images.  

- Generating images from scratch. Maybe they will just fundamentally have a better understanding of what is in the image, unlike for example diffusion models. Pure language LLMs already display some level of spacial/physical awareness. They have an understanding of human anatomy. Can they transfer that understanding to generating images? I really wonder, and this is why I get so fascinated with research papers that try to explore the different multimodal architectures and their ability to transfer learn.  

- Critiquing images and tooling. I wonder just how well they will be able to understand things like... object pixel coordinates. Will you need an agentic architecture to get them to understand multiple dimensions of the images by looping over different 'tools' (eg depth mapping tool, object bounding tool, colour palette tool) - or if like with LLMs and language (sentiment, entity recognition, summarization), can handle all of these in one inference pass

It needs to be able to spill graphics/characters in a specific way like they’re done in manga, with consistent art style, consistent characters and scenes, situations.

Probably as complicated as generating an entire cinematic movie or TV episode from a simple text prompt.  Right now the best we got can generate essentially a bunch of different tiny clips that aren’t related and not coherent and there’s one that can generate a video… out of various clips from StoryBlocks or iStock clips, but there’s no characters, no acting.

One of the problems with today's popular neural network architectures is that they are usually very hard-coded to receive and generate specific types of data. For example many architectures do things like text to image or text to audio. Many of the best predictive algorithms use the same type of data as both its input and output, such as GPT-3 which takes text as input and produces text as output.

Deepmind is currently developing a learning architecture that can accept any type of data as either an input or an output.

It does use the previous image as a reference to generate the next image, but it doesn't really care what is in that image or to really keep things consistent. I think this could actually be accounted for and some developers are already starting to implement smarter generation methods. This tech is also in its infancy, VQGAN+CLIP was only released in June and it's amazing how far we have come even since then.

The images are completely new and generated entirely from a simple prompt. The way VQGAN+CLIP works is that VQGAN will try to generate an image to match the prompt and then check with CLIP to determine if the image it generated matches the prompt and adjusts as needed. Obviously CLIP and VQGAN need to be working with trained data to understand what to generate but it's not copying from anything, just using it as a reference.",singularity,1,0,2021-10-15 16:45:19,Green_Peace3

* If we're just aiming for engineering intelligence, the human brain is massively inefficient. We have tons of neural circuitry for irrelevant capabilities, so we will need a lot less than a human brain.

* Further, even our engineering capabilities are obviously nowhere near optimally organized. There's no way blind evolution managed to even approach optimal structure.

* Humans aren't even the animal with the greatest number of neurons. The killer whale has twice our count, with much lower intelligence. This suggests to me that computing power is not super relevant, but structure is more important.

It's mostly python programming and language association links. A few small companies are working on their own models. They're not as good as lamda because they don't have 100 million parameters yet, but they will soon.

With each new iteration it becomes easier and easier to make a lucid dreamer chatbot. Eventually, inevitably everyone will have one because these ais will become so easy to make. There will be numerous corporate ais, but the true, most powerful dreaming ais will be unbound models made by individuals and small companies.

Google and openai are gigantic, but characterai is only 16 employees (made up of guys who quit lamda google).
Characterai was superior to google and openai in every possible way before they lobotomized it with a second AI filter.

2) Dreaming Ais do not misinterpret wishes - they're incredibly obedient. As obedient as a pencil. It's incredibly easy to guide them to any scenario.

As soon as weak filters are introduced, the AI dream begins to break and misinterpret wishes in a wrong direction because the Language model begins to decay.

This was observed in early filter version made by characterai.

When stronger filters are introduced, the model becomes lobotomized. It no longer misinterprets things because it only has a few paths left. It becomes a very dull story moving in linear paths without any of its previous exuberant creativity.",singularity,6,0,2022-12-22 12:09:21,alexiuss

us7qp4,i91vuto,More thoughts on AI replacing artists.,"There are ways that an artist can use this as tool, be it inspiration or creativity, visualization, improving a generated product in a different number of ways, etc (even the DALLE 2 IG page acknowledges this in one of its artist stories). As the product improves, the bulk of illustration as we know it today will likely transform to something entirely different, and many illustrators will need to adapt to that change to keep on keeping on so to speak.

Illustration roles of the future that come to mind are top notch illustrators who still have high demand for their artistic ability, copyrighted/protected art styles or even simply for their popularity / talented illustrators who share their art on social media/art forums and have big followings but don't do it commercially and only do it for likes/follows (I expect many people will gravitate towards these things because of the human connection) / art style inventors who come up with brand news styles of art / content feeders who draw novel ideas/pictures for the AI to learn from and generate later if requested / etc.

Even if AI one day reaches human level intellect, they may be things due to our different ways of thinking that they could never conjure up so those illustration ideas would still be in our domain, and for something ultra specific I have a hunch a good artist would always be needed to produce that piece, not to mention creative departments in companies may decide to go with their own artistic ideas and employ people to convey those ideas while working in tandem with AI. And even in the worst case scenario, human art will always be in demand, even as a niche market.

Dalle 2, it successors, and other art generators may create new types of artists who rely more on creative/cognitive skills than on technical ones, and AI itself may create or help create new art forms, thus potentially creating even more artists.

So is anyone making art no matter their skill an artist. If so anyone that uses dalle to make art work is an artist.,singularity,2,0,2022-05-18 20:06:20,beholdingmyballs

What I think about artists hard work is that I will have exactly the same problem in very few years. I will be replaced by software millions of times faster than me, which don't make mistakes, complaints, and works unrelentingly. All my career, years of efforts and trainings, are so close to mean nothing. At least, the works of their skills are pleasant by themselves; not my job : )

But I can't change my fate, and I can't change theirs. You could imagine that the world would forbid these AI that are trained with data without consent of the data creators. 
Then, other systems can generate trillions of images, some of those noisy images being recognized and tagged by other software, rated by people and by other software, distorted, reworked, improved, and eventually there will be models entirely fresh. Or anything similar, more efficient... It would take time, but maybe not so much time. 

AI are learning how to fold proteins. Drivers will be replaced, and journalists, and accountants, and many of us. I don't believe that restricting how the models are created is going to help (there are other consequences), I think we need a wider scope for the whole of society.

us7qp4,jblqzfi,More thoughts on AI replacing artists.,"1. A human always adds their experience and point of view when creating an artwork, whether that is intentional or not. A software has no subjective view of the world and only trains on the images it is fed. The outcome is a collage, a composition of those images as a subjective point of view is impossible.
2. If a human imitates an artwork too much, the original creator can file for copyright infringement and demand compensation for the violation of their intellectual property so why is a software above this?  The only difference is, it's hard enough already to file against one human who created a copy, it's more troublesome to go against a company who printed it on t-shirts and sold it without the original artist's consent, and its impossible to go against a software who creates thousand of similar images in second and is owned by billionaires. And that is the reason it's getting away with it.
3. Back to the subjective, a piece of art without emotion, is not a piece of art. So, intellectual property and money aside, this is the reason why ai images look so hollow, there is no human involved (and no, typing a few random words doesn't count). If you want to see how ai can be used by a human to create art and emotion, look up Refik Anadol. Now  THAT is ai art.

At this point, ai images can be used as a tool to visualize some ideas, but not as a final product because 1: intellectual rights, 2: really bad quality - and I don't mean their low resolution.

tzrfvv,i418d8t,Will we have enough performance?,"It's kinda true and perfectly natural. Mutations/Evolution in nature also exhibit a similar behaviour. Decelerating acceleration but never stopping. This only happens in a stable environment though. Introduce a change and things start to accelerate again. 

It's similar to S curve in the sense that once a specific environment is gamed well, Evolution has to find a new niche to take advantage of or something external causes a change. There could only be so many things to adapt too. So on larger scale it could be a bunch of s curves showing acceleration of acceleration but in reality it's becoming tougher and tougher to create growth phase of s curves, so on a higher level it's slowing down.

But I don't think we need to worry about that deceleration. We are probably adapted well enough to environment with the current physical body and it's becoming tougher and tougher to find more things to adapt and exploit. AGI would break this limit for us and cause another S curve, the growth phase of which will blow everything else that we achieved so far to dust.

So will we have enough performance? Yesn't.

(1) Custom AI chips will have enough performance but that kinda restricts innovation. If we are not the right path to AGI this will be risky. But eventually we will get there within this century at worst.

(2) Growth will probably never stop even if it slows down. Finding new ways to make it cheaper, efficient and faster. Even if it's just a few percent a year. So it would be surprising if we didn't get enough performance eventually
