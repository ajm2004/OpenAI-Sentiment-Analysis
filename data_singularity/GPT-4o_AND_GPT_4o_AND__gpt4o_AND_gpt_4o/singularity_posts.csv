1g95sv1,,ChatGPT4o's incredible Silent Hill 2 observations,"I've been enjoying bouncing ideas back and forth with 4o on all sorts of topics. Like I'll send it a poem I've written and it will analyze it in really beautiful ways. But I'm not sure if I've ever been as pleasantly surprised by the insightfulness and creativity of AI in the same way as I was here (with the possible exception of a song I created with Suno). Unfortunately, I can't share the conversation directly as conversations with images can't be linked to. I'll copy and paste in our conversation. Apologies if this is long-winded. I just think it's important to observe qualities in current AI that impress. And the more poetic elements of LLMs aren't talked about as often as other capabilities.

This will contain some spoilers for the game Silent Hill 2.

It began really with a couple of my simple observations of the original game as a whole, then I asked it for some gameplay tips on Hard mode (I've been playing the Enhanced Edition, fan restoration and upscale project of the original game). >!Maria was dying over and over again in the corridor chase section of the game. !<Then, I noticed something. I had my own ideas as to what it meant, but was curious what GPT could come up with on its own. Those of you reading may want to consider the image I post here carefully to see if you can see what I noticed, too. Spoilers of the game untagged throughout, you've been warned.

>Me: I noticed something interesting just before the chase in the corridor begins. I hadn't noticed it in previous playthroughs of the game. I think it has fascinating implications in regards to the metaphorical and philosophical depth of the game. I took a screenshot. Consider this image carefully. I'm wondering if you can see what I spotted. It may be difficult because the image is dark.

https://preview.redd.it/5fscmisla7wd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=28f8e50b40240f99c69778e86b6d15fb1fede7b2

>GPT: Looking at the image, I notice that it shows a narrow, dark corridor with Maria walking through it. Based on the context of the game and this particular scene, something intriguing is happening visually.

>From what I can tell, it seems like there is a subtle shadow or figure behind Maria, which could be Pyramid Head looming ominously just out of sight. This seems to suggest a deeper, metaphorical presence—that Maria is being pursued by James' guilt or the manifestation of James' inner demons even before the chase begins.

>The game is full of psychological layers, and if this shadow is indeed Pyramid Head or a representation of James’ guilt, it speaks volumes about how Maria is never really safe, mirroring the unresolved emotional turmoil James is going through. The dark, tight space could represent the suffocating pressure James feels as his guilt closes in, with Pyramid Head being the embodiment of that guilt and judgment.

>Is this along the lines of what you noticed, or was there something else? Let me know what caught your attention!

>Me: That's a really great analysis and is very close to my own observation. Here is another screenshot I took. What do you see in this one?

https://preview.redd.it/wmxe4f41d7wd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=595ac237356bf2d86b9d3eb93cc132574d1ad6b8

>GPT: This screenshot directly shows Maria, with a shadow cast on the wall behind her. The shadow is of James but interestingly, it seems larger, more looming, and somewhat distorted, especially around the head. The silhouette is almost reminiscent of Pyramid Head due to its sharp, angular appearance, as if James' figure is merging with the symbol of his guilt and internal torment.

>This shot could be a powerful visual cue—foreshadowing how James and Pyramid Head are intrinsically linked, reflecting the burden of guilt and the darker aspects of James’ psyche. Maria, who appears oblivious to this, stands right in front of him, perhaps representing how James’ guilt overshadows his interactions with her, even when he is trying to protect or care for her.

>The play with light and shadow in this scene draws attention to the psychological layers at work—James is haunted by himself, his actions, and the monstrous embodiment of that guilt in Pyramid Head. **What makes it even more unsettling is that Maria is caught between James and this looming shadow, hinting at her role as a projection of James' idealized memories of Mary and his deeper emotional conflicts.**

>What do you think of this interpretation? Does it align with your thoughts or add another layer?

  


>Me: Your analysis in regards to what this shadow could represent is solid. I love it. The only thing that I would add is that in both screenshots the shadow is Maria's, projected onto the wall behind her by James' flashlight. So, in both screenshots it is Maria's shadow that is reminiscent of Pyramid Head. Like you said of the first screenshot, it's like Pyramid Head looming ominously, and in the second screenshot the sharp, angular appearance of Pyramid Head is even more apparent in the shadow. My own interpretation was that Maria comes from the same place AS Pyramid Head. As in, manifestations of James' shadow. In the Jungian sense, his own unconscious belief that he deserves punishment. Your own analysis - of being pursued by guilt or the manifestation of James' inner demons even before the chase, the tight space of the corridor representing the suffocating pressure of his guilt, the play of light and shadow - these are all fantastic interpretations. I'm also impressed by your observation of Maria as being caught between James and the looming shadow of Pyramid Head behind her, and how this hints at her role as a projection. That was an incredible observation that did not occur to me.

  


>GPT: I'm really glad that my analysis resonated with your interpretation, and I appreciate the clarification that the shadow is actually Maria's in both screenshots. That adds an even more layered and subtle depth to the scene, emphasizing how Maria and Pyramid Head are connected as projections of James' unconscious mind.

>Your interpretation—that Maria and Pyramid Head both come from the same place, manifestations of James' ""shadow"" in a Jungian sense—is fascinating. It makes perfect sense that both Maria and Pyramid Head would represent aspects of James' unresolved guilt, but in different ways. Pyramid Head is the brutal, unforgiving force of punishment, while Maria is the alluring but ultimately painful reminder of what James has lost, or rather, destroyed. Both are James' ""punishers"" in their own way: Pyramid Head with physical violence, and Maria with emotional suffering.

>I also love how you bring up the Jungian concept of the ""shadow"" as an unconscious belief that James deserves punishment. It enriches the interpretation of the game on a psychological level, with Silent Hill itself becoming the place where James must confront his shadow and integrate these dark, repressed parts of his psyche. The visual connection between Maria and Pyramid Head, through her shadow taking on the shape of his form, seems to suggest that no matter how James tries to interact with Maria, he cannot escape the inevitable judgment that Pyramid Head represents. It's like Maria carries that judgment within her, just as James carries it within himself.

>It also makes me think about how Silent Hill as a place functions almost like a dreamscape or psychic landscape, where physical reality is shaped by the psyche of the individual. Shadows are often symbolic of repressed parts of the self, and in this case, Maria’s shadow becoming Pyramid Head suggests that she is the very embodiment of James' unresolved inner darkness.

>Your observation ties everything together beautifully—Maria and Pyramid Head as dual expressions of James' guilt, one as the tempting illusion and the other as the brutal enforcer of truth. It's a masterful use of visual storytelling that speaks to the game’s brilliance.

>Are there any other moments from *Silent Hill 2* that stand out to you with a similarly rich interpretation, or does this one particularly resonate due to the strong Jungian symbolism?

So that's where the conversation currently is. I'm truly mind-blown by several things. One, it got that the shadow resembles Pyramid Head in both images. Two, you really cannot fault at all how it interprets the meaning. Three, it made a leap in observation that didn't occur to me at all yet which makes total sense - that Maria, the symbol of Mary, is caught between James and the shadow of Pyramid Head. That's such a solid reading of it that didn't occur to me yet adds so much. There's lots of little nuances in GPT's analysis that are wonderful.

At the very least, it's like talking to a particularly intelligent fan that really gets it.

But that particular observation about Maria trapped between James and the shadow - wow. You know, the only thing I was able to find in a google search on Maria's shadow was a reddit thread where it looked like the guy posting the thread just wanted confirmation from others what he had seen which he wasn't getting.

And I've watched loads of Silent Hill YouTube essays - I can't recall Maria's shadow ever being brought up.

As far as I can determine, GPT4o made this leap of awesome media observation and analysis on its own, with minimal prodding from myself. Really, its responses are way above mine. I mean yeah, the general themes, the context, there'd be no shortage of material online that it could draw from to talk about those things at length. But is that really different from what a human does? Drawing upon context of themes and characters to enrich observations?

Am I crazy to have been a little mind-blown?",singularity,20,10,2024-10-22 00:51:32,KaineDamo
1dlelcg,,"Like always, I've tested Claude 3.5 Sonnet when it comes to complex translation (Chinese to English) compared to the other options.","Every time a new AI comes out, I have to test it to see if it's better than the GPT I've painstakingly made. Currently, my GPT can score anywhere from 92% to 98% in terms of accuracy. It still struggles with pronouns, which is an unfortunate side effect of translating from a language that rarely uses pronouns.

From my previous tests, GPT 4o is still the best, even if it sucks hard at fixing anything once it gets going, requiring me to start a fresh chat to ""reset"" it. Also requires me to ""Cycle"" through until I get the correct ""Seed"" in order to continue. It's a pain in the ass to use, but it's worth it for the accuracy.

The way accuracy works is how much % of the text I need to edit. If I need to edit 5% of the text, then it's 95% accurate. 

For this test, I'm using my GPT-4o prompt. Keep in mind that while Claude and GPT can use the same Prompts, the way that GPT understands those prompt keys is different to how Claude understands them and, thus, Claude will be at a minor disadvantage.

Surprisingly enough... Claude 3.5 won. This is the first time this has happened. Claude 3 Opus had barely lost to GPT-4 Turbo. I expected the same to happen between GPT-4o and 3.5 Sonnet. 

But there are a few annoying key points. GPT-4o will allow you to paste a large text and will translate it normally until it reaches output end and then allow you to continue (a button will show for you to click).

Claude, on the other hand, ate some of the text in the middle. This was terrible and it should have never done it. But, it can be fixed by just splitting the text into chunks.

On the 5 Texts I had them tested, the score was as follows:

GPT-4o:

93%

94%

93%

97%

93%

Sonnet:

95%

95%

94%

97%

93%

As such, Sonnet wins by a very small margin. Maybe with a few changes to the prompt, it can boost it another 1% or so overall. Most importantly, it never did worse than GPT-4o.

Sonnet preferred to increase the length of a paragraph if it believed it had to explain more than what the original text said, as in this example:

GPT-4o:

They would likely protect each other with their lives if needed.

Sonnet:

It seemed like they were the type of friends who would risk their lives to protect each other if anything happened to either one of them.

If this is good or bad can be argued, but it did allow it to expand on parts of the text that were too simplistic in English, but were fine in Chinese, because of how the language is structed. 

Sonnet was also overall slightly better at getting the right pronouns.

Over all, I'm hopeful that 3.5 Opus will blow 4o out of the water.",singularity,73,15,2024-06-21 21:02:49,Grand0rk

IQ itself is a metric that is meant to evaluate humans.

They're assuming generalized intelligence by taking into consideration a single metric ai can excel at

Here they're not even using an iq test to come to that conclusion, they're extrapolating that from a metric that itself correlates with IQ

An AI achieving high IQ makes it pretty good at either (1) stuff that IQ measures or (2) performing IQ tests because they are well documented. 

Sadly im afraid it’s (2) rather than (1).

1hkxmi6,m3juvhm,o3's estimated IQ is 157,"Why? IQ is on a bell curve. That makes every increase in IQ exponentially more rare than the last increase. 

Think about it in terms of luck: imagine you wanted to use a bar graph to compare the difference in chances for flipping one coin and it landing on heads versus flipping 10 coins and all 10 land on heads. 

There’s “only 9 more coins” in the second scenario. How much harder could it be to get 10 heads than 1 head? Maybe just 10 times harder?

Would your second bar be only 10x higher than your first bar? Obviously not. 

There’s a 1 in 2 chance to get heads on one coin. 

There’s a 1 in 1024 chance to get heads on 10 consecutive coins. 

That’s 512x harder to do! Because every coin you add makes it exponentially harder to get all heads. 

IQ is the same. A 10 point increase on an already high IQ is a **MASSIVE CHANGE.** Whereas a 10 point increase from just 100 to 110 isn’t so special.",singularity,1,0,2024-12-24 05:01:11,Jan0y_Cresva

Although I agree that this case isn't much harder than the case n = 2, o1 pro doesn't seem to be able to solve it. Only spits generic bs that won't cut it in an Olympiad.

  
For A2, this problem isn't even original and the model could've easily been trained on problems and solutions from past Olympiads and Team Selection Tests for IMO. On this problem, the argument as to why deg(p) > 1 doesn't yield solution is again not rigorous at all-- this is the heart of the original problem.

  
For A3, the response is worth only 1/7 points if we grade as an USAMO/IMO problem. 

  
Having guessed the final solution for a problem is nowhere near as hard as constructing a proof for it. As an example, in any regional/international math olympiad you'd get 0/7 if you were only to guess the solutions of a functional equation (unless it's really hard to describe them).

1hkxmi6,m3i5jpq,o3's estimated IQ is 157,"Yeah exactly, but to me, IQ is more about the brain’s ability to find patterns and abstract thinking for problem solving than it is memorizing. 

Memorizing is partly useful but not nearly as important as abstract thinking and pattern recognition. 

For example, numerous Jeopardy contestants have had photographic memories, but that’s not very useful—all that gets the human is extreme recall, it doesn’t mean they are highly intelligent. 

None of them could do what Einstein did. 

What intelligence is to me is the ability to solve a problem using abstract thought. So a simple example would be early humans maybe grabbing a stick to knock down some bananas out of a tree they couldn’t reach. That human brain knew of sticks, it knew of the danger of falling if they climbed the tree, it knew that if struck hard enough the bananas would fall down.

I'd also suggest that on average the more the Elo score rises the higher the Intelligence Quotient will be on average.


Now once again the IQ of the model and the Codeforce IQ differ. But the result speak for themselves. On this isolated Benchmark it's outperforming tons of users that have a higher base IQ on average that quite frankly will have a higher baseline than the general IQ of a population.

This statement seems to be playing with versions or iterations of something labeled as ""4"" and ""4o."" To break it down:

1. ""Current 4 is worse than 4o was"": This means that the present version of ""4"" is not as good as the earlier version of ""4o."" So, the older version of ""4o"" performed better than the current ""4.""


2. ""Back when old 4 was better than 4o would have been"": In the past, an older version of ""4"" was better than what ""4o"" would have been had it existed at that time. So, at that point in time, ""old 4"" was superior to a hypothetical ""4o.""



Full interpretation:

In the past, ""old 4"" was better than a hypothetical ""4o."" But now, the ""current 4"" is actually worse than the version of ""4o"" that existed in the past. This suggests a reversal in performance or quality, where ""4"" used to be superior but has since degraded, while ""4o"" was once considered inferior but now seems better in comparison to the current ""4.""

The artifacts functionality is code interpreter on steroids, like writing code in natural language in nearly real time without that copy/paste/run nonsense. Great UX. (for non-pro-coders like myself that do not use GitHub copilot at least).

Reasoning wise it still fails badly on my trickier prompts, even with the help of artifacts.

GPT4 has never solved this correctly, not even close.  Opus came really close, but struggled on the tests.  This new model solved it fairly easily.  The property tests failed, meaning it had generated code that missed edge cases, but every time I pasted them back to it I got further improvements until eventually I could generate tens of thousands of boards with zero failures.

This blew my mind, none of the other models even get close to getting this right and I've invested significant time going back and forth trying to walk them through to a solution!

At the end I even had this new model generate me a better original prompt that would have made it easier for it to solve first time.  I fed that (huge) prompt back to GPT4 (and 4o) and it failed completely, generating garbage.

1dkchef,l9hwm6l,AnthropicAI: Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"Still overfitted to river-crossing puzzles, given a simplified version that is trivial to solve, it overcomplicates it. 

> **User:** Hey, people have been asking AIs this question. I wonder how you'll do…
> 
> A man is walking with a goat and they come to a river with a boat on the riverside. How can they get across the river? Please give a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind your answer.
>
> **Assistant:** This question appears to be a logic puzzle, so I'll approach it step-by-step:
> 
> 1. First, let's identify the key elements:
>    - A man
>    - A goat
>    - A river
>    - A boat on the riverside
> 
> 2. The goal is to get both the man and the goat across the river.
> 
> 3. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:
> 
>    a) If the boat is large enough for both:  
>       - The man can simply put the goat in the boat and row across.  
>       - This is the simplest solution, but it depends on the boat's size.  
> 
>    b) If the boat is only large enough for one:  
>       - The man can row the goat across, then return and row himself across.  
>       - This requires two trips but solves the problem.  
> 
>    c) If the boat is too small even for the goat:  
>       - This scenario would make crossing impossible using just the boat.
> 
> 4. Without more information about the boat's size, the most likely scenario is (b), as it presents an interesting puzzle.
> 
> 5. Reasoning:
>    - Most river-crossing puzzles involve limitations that make the solution less obvious.
>    - If the boat could fit both, there would be no real puzzle to solve.
>    - A boat too small for even the goat would make the puzzle unsolvable, which is unlikely to be the intended scenario.
> 
> Therefore, the most probable solution is:
>
> 1. The man puts the goat in the boat and rows it across the river.
> 2. The man leaves the goat on the far side and rows back alone.
> 3. The man then rows himself across the river.
> 4. The man and goat are now both on the far side of the river.
> 
> This solution assumes the goat can't operate the boat, which is a reasonable assumption for most goats.

1dkchef,l9hyq4d,AnthropicAI: Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"I find physical reasoning tests really interesting and 3.5 Sonnet really impressed me with this response: 

**Me:** I give my friend a dollar bill. He places it on a dinner table. He then covers it with a table cloth. He sets the table. He then rips the table cloth away, and the dishes stay in place. Where is the dollar now?

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet** Let's analyze this situation step by step:

You give your friend a dollar bill.

He places it on a dinner table.

He covers it with a tablecloth.

He sets the table, placing dishes on top of the tablecloth.

He rips the tablecloth away quickly, and the dishes stay in place.

Now, to determine where the dollar is, we need to consider the physics of this trick:

When a tablecloth is pulled away quickly, objects on top of it tend to stay in place due to inertia. However, lightweight objects that are in direct contact with the tablecloth are likely to be pulled along with it.

In this case, the dollar bill is:

Lightweight

In direct contact with the tablecloth

Underneath the tablecloth (not weighted down by dishes)

Given these factors, the most likely outcome is that the dollar bill was pulled away with the tablecloth when it was ripped away.

Therefore, the dollar is most likely wherever the tablecloth ended up after being pulled from the table. It could be:

On the floor near where your friend was standing when he pulled the tablecloth

Caught in the folds of the tablecloth

In your friend's hand along with the tablecloth

The key point is that the dollar, being light and in direct contact with the tablecloth, would have moved with the tablecloth rather than staying on the table like the heavier dishes.",singularity,2,0,2024-06-20 18:16:20,throwaway957280

1dkchef,l9j61wm,AnthropicAI: Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"Devil's advocate: it's still a GPT-4-class model. Most of the people saying progress is dead are remarking on how there are no generational leaps, something clearly an order of magnitude or greater better than GPT-4, but rather just 5% or 10% better. 

Think of it like GPT-4 being the Playstation 2. The GameCube and Xbox were both more powerful with their own quirks (like the GC having micro-DVDs or the Xbox not having immediate DVD playback). Maybe they have their own unique appeal, but imagine the Xbox 360 now being a competitor. There's quite literally no advantage or quirk any older console has now. 

That's this. Claude and Gemini are better than 4 in many ways; Opus and 3.5 Sonnet might as well be the Xbox.

But there is no Xbox 360 moment. There is no model so supremely above the SOTA that there's absolutely no comparison or reason to use any other model because it renders even Opus looking like a toy LLM by comparison.

Indeed. It seems like OpenAI is very focused on improving the underlying model, and the ChatGPT UI experience is a distance secondary priority.

Model improvements are great, but as a user I want to see UI innovation that improves my ability to use what the models already offer with less friction and more power.

    Can you please rewrite the test_scrabble_validator.py implementation to:

    Use pytest
    Use hypothesis generators for all unit tests.

1dkchef,l9iaw2q,AnthropicAI: Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"Speaking anecdotally here, but our company was evaluating different APIs last year and in all honesty, Anthropic was a laughing stock (until recently). They released the mediocre Claude 2 several months after GPT-4 was out. They banned accounts for no apparent reason, with no warning, and word spreads. They had such a high refusal rate that it was unviable at any level.

As a result our company did a few experiments and then integrated elswehere. Of course eventually Anthropic redeemed themselves with the wonderful Claude-3 lineup, but by then I expect it to have been too late for most similar companies who had comfortably deployed other providers to production. I happen to be an AI researcher who stays up to date and runs lots of experiments so our startup could pivot rapidly - but I expect any other standard API user to not bother and stay the course. If its working, why fix it after all. Once one model is deployed, the improvements are marginal between them for many usecases.",singularity,15,0,2024-06-20 19:23:34,Zulfiqaar

Opus is the most resource-intensive, so it costs the most, but it gives the most creative answers. Sonnet is a good ""work horse"" when you want something that gives a good answer quickly but is cheaper than Opus. And then Haiku is the cheapest / less resource intensive so if you have a lot of volume or just need very simple responses quickly you can use Haiku and not break the bank.

The web chat version is not the main product, the API is. On the web chat, you have rate limits on each of the models because they don't want you to use Opus all the time, they want you to switch to Sonnet and then Haiku as you run into limits, because then it is cheaper for them to run.

Picture this: Leaves, dark green, almost black, glossy as a freshly waxed car, and every single one a perfect little diamond shape. And when the sun hits 'em? Forget about it! Like stained glass in a cathedral! And the bark, oh, don't even get me started on the bark! Smooth as a baby's cheek, pale gray, almost silvery. Just exquisite!

But yeah, Gemini 1,5 pro and Opus (Now Haiku 3,5) through API are really the superior experiences. I subscribed to chatgpt app after some time just to see how's it going through there (and API is costly if you're using it regularly so I thought about switching the subscription) and the app (or main UI) version is incredibly dry and mediocre compared to what APIs offer. I know it can also get the job done but it's very boring to use and interact with.

If things go with this trajectory Google will definitely overtake OpenAI (in API space that is), and Anthropic will become bigger as more people use their AI (no app thing is affecting them).

OpenAI better has some near AGI level stuff with gpt5 or it will lose ground fast.

A little advice here: See more often than not, when people talk about ""vibes"" it's essentially a so far inexplicable difference someone cannot put their fingers on, that acts as an implication for other people to help verify whether or not that thing is true.

While the image is quite dark, I can make out what appears to be rough, textured walls with some kind of dark opening or passageway ahead. Due to the low lighting, it's challenging to make out specific details that might have caught your attention.

>I'd be very interested to hear what you noticed - Silent Hill 2 is known for its subtle environmental storytelling and symbolic details that players often discover even after multiple playthroughs. Could you point out what you spotted? These kinds of discoveries often add new layers to the game's already rich psychological narrative.

In response to the second image:

>Claude: Ah, now I can see much more clearly - this is Maria in the corridor, and I notice there's a shadow cast on the wall behind her. Given the game's heavy use of symbolism and the context of this being just before the Pyramid Head chase sequence, I believe I understand what caught your attention - is it that her shadow appears to resemble Mary's more conservative silhouette rather than Maria's distinctive outline?

>This would be a brilliant piece of environmental storytelling, subtly reinforcing the complex relationship between Maria and Mary, and perhaps foreshadowing that Maria is a manifestation of James's guilt and memories of Mary. The shadow not matching the person casting it would be a powerful visual metaphor for Maria's true nature.

>Is this what you noticed, or did you spot something else? These kinds of subtle details really demonstrate the thoughtfulness that went into the game's psychological symbolism.

It failed in both instances to recognize the resemblance of the shadow to Pyramid Head, made up that it resembles Mary more than Maria which I don't think is true at all, and it did not provide any unique observations.",singularity,0,0,2024-10-22 17:02:08,KaineDamo
