We are on the cusp of truly effective and superhuman AI agents.

Very intrigued to see the data centres train new models with b200s and the final o5/6 models that get released after training from them end of 2025.

I truly think we saturate all bench marks by end of 2025 (capabilities of a math department, expert/research level in all fields). Definition of AGI + agents.

The  next models will probably shoot beyond what humans can do in this field. So we'll get models that can build entire applications if given detailed requirements. Models that reduce years of PhD work to a few hours. Models that are able to tackle novel frontier Maths at a superhuman level with superhuman speed.


I suspect humans will struggle to keep up with what these models are outputting at first. The model will output stuff in an hour that will take a team of humans months to verify.

In his view, superintelligence is about science/math fields. Which makes sense given what reasoning models can do. So he's okay with it not being general--presumably, superintelligence thus defined could do ""anything else."" (Including maybe coming up ways to generalize itself? That's consistent with what the 'Situational Awareness"" essay proposes.) And it's consistent with his AGI definition: ""if you could hire an AI as a remote employee to be a great software engineer, I think a lot of people would say, “OK, that's AGI-ish.”""

Would that be better? Narrow ASI could ""massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.""

it will however assist in killing a lot of poor people as their purpose as cogs in the machine, is replaced by automation, and so they become something akin to ""useless eaters"" as the nazis put it. and then AI will change the narrative through personalized targeted propaganda, as it currently is doing. today, right now, to everyone. even me, even you. so a smaller remaining population becomes easier to control. and it will be a combination of things over decades. the more automation rolls out, the more disasters we will face. disease (cancer, viruses, bacterial infection, etc) famine (crop failure, higher prices, starvation) war (perhaps WW3 is finally given the title, and the war effort to kill young men, women, and children enmass comes to fruition), climate change (coastal cities face rising sea levels, increased severe weather, loss of utlities, and eventually flee or die, and denied legal entry as admission limits are ""too high"" for most countries after the first initial influx. not just that, but areas are experiencing record high temperatures across the world year over year. and regardless of super intelligence, projects it designs will not be able to be implicated before runaway temperatures take hold. 

this system wont allow something as ""trivial"" as super intelligent AI to threaten it. but it will use AI to help it maintain and grow its power. because they currently own it, and they will never let it go, if they play their cards right. and you (us) dont play our hand at all. 

this is the very real present and future we are seeing, unless we the people, force change now, we need to get together and fight for AI REGULATION WORLD WIDE, and CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES. 

its going to be a rough couple of decades ahead of all of us, i highly suggest becoming self sufficient in every manner you can imagine, first aid, growing and preserving food, DIY everything, if not just for practice, to reduce spending, save your money, if you want something more traditionally stable, save physical things like gold, or silver. make communities with your friends family and neighbours, trade favours and goods, for instance if your friend makes bread, trade him some home grown tomatoes. 

i also suggest people getting into things like hydroponics and indoor growing as the seasons become fickle and hard to track. my uncle lost several fields of grain over the last few years due to inclimate weather changes, we had a longer raining season and a shorter, much later winter which drowned his crops, and the dryest spring and summer before that. so it sucked for their family. luckily they were insured but now it costs more each year for them. i feel lile that will be a loop from now until potential collapse. 

dont panic, slowly gather these things and skills over the years, and teach others what you have learned. also if you are of a data hoarding mind set, which you should be, you should begin downloading things like wikipedia, archive.org, and anything related to survival and alternate systems to express a better future, considering the amount of automation that will come our way, perhaps look into not just community building, but things like a resource based economy. 

do not be split by politics, religion, sex, race, or creed. we are human beings, we are all one. and the planet is what sustains us, we have to live in balance. otherwise, nature, the greatest dictator, will destroy us. it does not care about anything except your ability to rebel by surviving. anything less means death. 

together we are strong, and if we work together, more of us will survive long enough to see the other side, if there is one. and the more of us that survive and reject the monetary systems that caused this, the higher the chance a new and better, less corruptable system will come from it.

On the other hand, the performance increases we can squeeze out of moving from GPUs to ASICs is probably two orders of magnitude and that can happen in 1 to 2 years. So if it is $10 million to run an AGI for a year in 2025, it will be $100,000 in 2027.  Likely there will be advances in algorithms and techniques over those two years so the next wave of ASIC drop the price at least to 50,000 by 2029. That full automation of most professions before 2030.


Now these starting numbers are all made up, but the orders of magnitude of known but currently realized efficiency gain unreleased means that AGI has to be really really expensive to not cause massive disruption before 2030 if we get AGI by 2025. We'd need it to cost 100s of millions of dollars per agent.per year to have a soft take off.

OpenAI is clearly working on improving all aspects of their AI models. Given that I would expect to potentially see a release of GPT5 and a continuation of improved inference or agentic models such as o4 and maybe even o5 in 2025. 

I would also really like to see more API usage of OpenAI models in software like word, excel, PowerPoint, CAD modeling, etc... and I think with more advanced inference models we will begin to see them doing that more as they can take on planning more actions to achieve a task.

A fiduciary duty to shareholders is not exclusive to public companies, it is also a responsibility that lies *squarely* on the shoulders of the board and executive team of private companies. It's all the same game -- if you have shareholders, whether they're public or private, you have a fiduciary duty to them. So that's point number one -- this duty exists whether they're public or private.

Point number two is that the fiduciary duty is widely misunderstood. It is not some sort of legal obligation to do whatever is necessary to maximize the share price no matter what. It is more nuanced than that and allows a lot of wiggle room, because the company cannot be compelled to do anything which it thinks would hurt it's reputation in a meaningful way (as this would end up damaging shareholder value anyway). Moreover, it cannot be compelled to do things which are clearly illegal or immoral or against it's mission. It has become a bit of a Reddit-ism to believe ""public companies are obligated to do whatever maximizes share price today with no regard for anything else"" but it is patently not true.",singularity,21,0,2025-01-06 05:09:58,garden_speech

No. If anything, you have it backwards. Institutions holding shares are often looking for longer term, stable returns. VC investors are far more tolerant of risk and in exchange they expect higher returns. 

Zuckerberg owns 13% of economic interest in META but his special class of shares ensures he keeps 51% controlling interest, so he is in control of the company.

I don't really give much thought to the simulation theory because: if it were true, I don't see how that would functionally/practically make any difference compared to this being the base reality. All it does is that it adds extra steps.

And what if the market is too volatile or the public interest isn't as high as expected, the valuation could plummet. And OAI's losses are massive, like 5 billion annual loss next year. Seems a lot more than when Tesla IPO'd.  
In OAI's case, what would be the advantage of IPO you reckon?

Do you believe the public institutional investors actually would be more patient than the VC investors?

Do you think if they IPO they will be able to raise more capital AND make AI more for benefit of mankind at large?

And OAI doesn't seem to have a clear profitable business model yet for how the AI is to be applied, especially if it's meant to be separate from Microsoft's application.

The bigger scale and more compute also has another benefit, more distilled and more capable models can be made, which means models like o3-mini can exist, that are both more capable but also cheaper than previous models.

Maybe it was $600 or $8000 per prompt, o3 high compute is expensive in any case.

o4 will likely be even more expensive, and then o5... I remember a recent interview with one of the Open AI devs, and he floated $1000000+ per prompt being a reasonable cost for some prompts.",singularity,1,0,2025-01-19 13:35:13,Alex__007

Maybe compute is still scaled up independent of this type of ARC problem. 

Interesting paragraph from that on the cost too:

“Of course, such generality comes at a steep cost, and wouldn’t quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly $5 per task (we know, we did that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires $17-20 per task in the low-compute mode. But cost-performance will likely improve quite dramatically over the next few months and years, so you should plan for these capabilities to become competitive with human work within a fairly short timeline.”",singularity,5,0,2025-01-18 16:20:54,socoolandawesome

* True AI (human-child to human-adult level of intelligence and capability to the point of potentially deserving personhood).

The ability to adapt learned information to solve novel problems is what ""general"" intelligence is.

People will use the rebuttal that ""it was trained on data specific for the tests so it is not artificial ""general"" intelligence."" 

The need for a test to be truly and completely novel is a fallacy of the ever moving goal posts of AGI.  Give a human a completely novel test where it is unlike any concept they have ever looked at before and guarantee your average person would fail it.

For example; The child's toy where they have to put the blocks into the correct shaped holes. The baby doesn't just automatically know which blocks go where, it tests each block, then through trial and error learns what the correct solutions are.

The ability for the baby to then utilize this learned knowledge to solve novel problems it hasn't seen before, even if it uses concepts it has seen/learned before, is what constitutes the ""general"" intelligence. That is what the o3 model did aka it has achieved some form of (AGI)

A model being able to solve a problem without any training data on a problem or the concepts involved would be an Artificial ""Super"" Intelligence of some kind.",singularity,1,0,2024-12-27 03:25:46,back-forwardsandup

1hipu2s,m3162if,o3's score on ARC-AGI is ridiculous....,"This. This is the true benchmark everyone should be using, at least to gauge if something is true AGI or not. It’s an incredible achievement from OpenAI, but it’s not “AGI”. Again, AGI is a system where, given the same setup (in ANY domain) (environment, tools, etc) as a human, it performs equally. o3 is incredibly impressive, but I think we still have a few years to go before true AGI. I would need to see it operate at human performance across other domains, not just the ARC test (e.g. driving a car, writing software, defending a legal argument, etc.). 

Btw your benchmark of a system that can be given the controls and sensor input to a robot, and operate it around a factory is a great example of something I would expect AGI to be able to do. 

Once we reach AGI, it’s only a matter of deployment time until we see large swaths of the economy automated. So the arrival of AGI will be quite obvious, give or take 1/2 years for system deployment at scale.",singularity,4,0,2024-12-20 20:09:22,YeetPrayLove
