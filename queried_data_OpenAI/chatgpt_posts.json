I pay for GPT Plus, I have the Advanced Voice model with Camera, I have the o1 model 50 week messages, which together with gemini-exp-1206 is enough.\n\n\nEdit: I found that gemini-exp-1206 with temperature 0 gives better responses for code",

What a horrible thing to do to people.\n\nI\u2019m sure so many people signed up hoping they would get this feature and it\u2019s no where in sight. \n\nMeanwhile, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is doing a great job and I\u2019m happy with it.
