Smartphones have completely killed many portable consumer electronics devices.  \nMusic players, portable DVD players, digital cameras, calculators, GPS navigators and so on.\n2. International calls are now very easily accessible. WhatsApp, Signal, Line, Viber, you-name-it.\n3. International money transfers are now very easily accessible.\n4. Videocalls are a thing now.\n5. The general pace of doing business is much much faster now than mere 10-15 years ago.\n6. Amount of video created and watched has skyrocketed to unfathomable heights\n7.

        "body": "So I am creating a new app using AI, like everybody else is .. lol. Mine works with transcriptions in any way you want to.\n\nI am testing and upgrading at the moment. I ran a test where I send the audio file over to Whisper on the OpenAI platform, and I should only get back the Translation, but today I got back this!\n\nIf you see in the image, it's translating ok, then it says in the returned translation 'Transcribed by otter.ai'. Where the hell did that come from? The text is just the raw transcription returned by Whisper which I then show in the App. Once I have that, the app does many wonderful things with it, but I have never seen this before. How did otter.ai get into my transcription from Whisper?!?!?\n\nHas anyone else had an issue like this?\n\nThe transcription is actually being handled by OpenAI's Whisper model through their API endpoint 'https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions'.\n\nHere's the complete audio-to-transcription lifecycle from the codebase:\n\n1. **Audio Recording**:\n   * User starts recording through the UI\n   * AudioRecorder class initializes with specific settings:\n      * Mono channel (channelCount: 1)\n      * 16kHz sample rate\n      * Enabled: echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain control\n      * Uses WebM format with Opus codec at 24kbps\n   * Audio is processed in real-time to ensure mono output and correct sample rate\n2. **Audio Processing**:\n   * Audio is captured in chunks every 2 seconds\n   * Each chunk is processed through Web Audio API\n   * Audio is downsampled if needed to maintain 16kHz\n   * Chunks are stored in WebM/Opus format\n3. **Transcription Preparation**:\n   * When recording stops, the audio chunks are combined\n   * The system checks if the file size is within limits (max 25MB)\n   * If file is large (>24MB), it's split into chunks for processing\n4. **Transcription Process**:\n   * Audio is sent to OpenAI's Whisper API (endpoint: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions')\n   * Uses 'whisper-1' model\n   * Audio is sent as a FormData object with the audio file\n   * If chunked, each chunk is processed separately and results are combined\n5. **Post-Processing**:\n   * Transcription results are cleaned:\n      * Whitespace is trimmed\n      * Multiple spaces are reduced to single spaces\n      * Empty parts are filtered out\n   * Audio is converted to MP3 format for download/storage\n\nThe [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) references shouldn't be there - this appears to be an anomaly.\n\nThe transcript display component is very straightforward and just displays the raw transcript text. The Otter.ai references are definitely not coming from our codebase - there's no mention of Otter.ai anywhere in the code, and the transcription is handled entirely by OpenAI's Whisper API.\n\n\\#Whisper #OpenAI\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qagenslfz4de1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=809476fdcfc1e4eda888123baf710a46000dc72f\n\n",

        "body": "The other day, I\u2019m 'in the zone' writing code, upgrading our OpenAI python library from  0.28.1 to 1.3.5, when this marketing intern pops up beside my desk. \n\nHe\u2019s all flustered, like, 'How do I get GPT-4 to do what I want? It\u2019s repeating words, the answers are way too long, and it just doesn\u2019t do that thing I need.'\n\nSo, I dive in, trying to break down frequency penalty, logit bias, temperature, top_p \u2013 all that jazz. But man, the more I talk, the more his eyes glaze over. I felt bad (No bad students, only bad teachers right?)\n\nSo I told him, 'Give me a couple of hours,' planning to whip up a mini TED talk or something to get these concepts across without the brain freeze lol.\n\nPosting here in the hopes that someone might find it useful.\n\n### 1. **Frequency Penalty**: The 'No More Echo' Knob\n- **What It Does**: Reduces repetition, telling the AI to avoid sounding like a broken record.\n- **Low Setting**: \"I love pizza. Pizza is great. Did I mention pizza? Because pizza.\"\n- **High Setting**: \"I love pizza for its gooey cheese, tangy sauce, and perfect crust. It's an art form in a box.\"\n\n### 2. **Logit Bias**: The 'AI Whisperer' Tool\n- **What It Does**: Pushes the AI toward or away from certain words, like whispering instructions.\n- **Bias Against 'pizza'**: \"I enjoy Italian food, particularly pasta and gelato.\"\n- **Bias Towards 'pizza'**: \"When I think Italian, I dream of pizza, the circular masterpiece of culinary delight.\"\n\n### 3. **Presence Penalty**: The 'New Topic' Nudge\n- **What It Does**: Helps AI switch topics, avoiding getting stuck on one subject.\n- **Low Setting**: \"I like sunny days. Sunny days are nice. Did I mention sunny days?\"\n- **High Setting**: \"I like sunny days, but also the magic of rainy nights and snow-filled winter wonderlands.\"\n\n### 4. **Temperature**: The 'Predictable to Wild' Slider\n- **What It Does**: Adjusts the AI's level of creativity, from straightforward to imaginative.\n- **Low Temperature**: \"Cats are cute animals, often kept as pets.\"\n- **High Temperature**: \"Cats are undercover alien operatives, plotting world domination...adorably.\"\n\n### 5. **Top_p (Nucleus Sampling)**: The 'Idea Buffet' Range\n- **What It Does**: Controls the range of AI's ideas, from conventional to out-of-the-box.\n- **Low Setting**: \"Vacations are great for relaxation.\"\n- **High Setting**: \"Vacations could mean bungee jumping in New Zealand or a silent meditation retreat in the Himalayas!\"\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.",

In fact, I'm typing this comment right now using the Whisper technology on the ChatGPT app. But what I would really like is to have it as a separate keyboard for voice dictation. Is there any way I can get something like this?\n\nIs there a possibility that someone will develop it in the future?\n\nEdit: Now that I've reviewed what I just spoke into the ChatGPT app and copy-pasted it into this Reddit comment, I'm more impressed than ever. There's music playing behind me. I don't have to explicitly spell out any punctuation. It's like magic. It really is. Like magic.\n\nEdit 2: What the fuck has Google been doing all these years? Aren't they supposed to be this innovative company that's constantly improving their products? I can't believe that this kind of voice recognition technology was even possible until OpenAI allowed me to use it on their ChatGPT app. It really is terrible to see how the big tech giants have completely stopped innovating and improving their products.\n\nEdit 3: Both of the above edits, and this one as well, have been copy-pasted from the GPT app after speaking into it using the whisper voice recognition. I just can't wrap my mind around how good it is.\n\nAnd automatic capitalizations! I think I'm ready to cry.",

        "body": "https://x.com/JustineTunney/status/1825594600528162818\n\nfrom https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/whisper.cpp/doc/getting-started.md\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  \n\nI got it up and running on my mac m1 within 20 minutes. Its fast and accurate. It ripped through a 1.5 hour mp3 (converted to 16k wav) file in 3 minutes. I [compiled into self contained](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/whisper.cpp/doc/packaging.md) 40mb file and can run it as a command line tool with any program!\n\n## Getting Started with Whisperfile\n\nThis tutorial will explain how to turn speech from audio files into\nplain text, using the whisperfile software and OpenAI's whisper model.\n\n### (1) Download Model\n\nFirst, you need to obtain the model weights. The tiny quantized weights\nare the smallest and fastest to get started with. They work reasonably\nwell. The transcribed output is readable, even though it may misspell or\nmisunderstand some words.\n\n```\nwget -O whisper-tiny.en-q5_1.bin https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.en-q5_1.bin\n```\n\n### (2) Build Software\n\nNow build the whisperfile software from source. You need to have modern\nGNU Make installed. On Debian you can say `sudo apt install make`. On\nother platforms like Windows and MacOS (where Apple distributes a very\nold version of make) you can download a portable pre-built executable\nfrom <https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/>.\n\n```\nmake -j o//whisper.cpp/main\n```\n\n### (3) Run Program\n\nNow that the software is compiled, here's an example of how to turn\nspeech into text. Included in this repository is a .wav file holding a\nshort clip of John F. Kennedy speaking. You can transcribe it using:\n\n```\no//whisper.cpp/main -m whisper-tiny.en-q5_1.bin -f whisper.cpp/jfk.wav --no-prints\n```\n\nThe `--no-prints` is optional. It's helpful in avoiding a lot of verbose\nlogging and statistical information from being printed, which is useful\nwhen writing shell scripts.\n\n## Converting MP3 to WAV\n\nWhisperfile only currently understands .wav files. So if you have files\nin a different audio format, you need to convert them to wav beforehand.\nOne great tool for doing that is sox (your swiss army knife for audio).\nIt's easily installed and used on Debian systems as follows:\n\n```\nsudo apt install sox libsox-fmt-all\nwget https://archive.org/download/raven/raven_poe_64kb.mp3\nsox raven_poe_64kb.mp3 -r 16k raven_poe_64kb.wav\n```\n\n## Higher Quality Models\n\nThe tiny model may get some words wrong. For example, it might think\n\"quoth\" is \"quof\". You can solve that using the medium model, which\nenables whisperfile to decode The Raven perfectly. However it's slower.\n\n```\nwget https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.en.bin\no//whisper.cpp/main -m ggml-medium.en.bin -f raven_poe_64kb.wav --no-prints\n```\n\nLastly, there's the large model, which is the best, but also slowest.\n\n```\nwget -O whisper-large-v3.bin https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-large-v3.bin\no//whisper.cpp/main -m whisper-large-v3.bin -f raven_poe_64kb.wav --no-prints\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you like whisperfile, you can also install it as a systemwide command\nnamed `whisperfile` along with other useful tools and utilities provided\nby the llamafile project.\n\n```\nmake -j\nsudo make install\n```\n\ntldr; you can get local speech to text conversion (any audio converted to wav 16k) using whisper.cpp.",

        "body": " We recently benchmarked whisper-large-v2 against the substantial [**English CommonVoice dataset**](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) on a distributed cloud (SaladCloud) with consumer GPUs.\n\n**The Result: Transcribed 137 days of audio in 15 hrs for just $117.**\n\nTraditionally, utilizing a managed service like AWS Transcribe would set you back about **$10,500** for transcribing the entirety of the English CommonVoice dataset.\n\nUsing a custom model? That\u2019s an even steeper **$13,134**.\n\nIn contrast, our approach using Whisper on a distributed cloud cost just **$117**, achieving the same result.\n\n**The Architecture:**\n\nOur simple batch processing framework comprises:\n\n* **Storage:** Audio files stored in AWS S3.\u00a0\n* **Queue System:** Jobs queued via AWS SQS, with unique identifiers and accessible URLs for each audio clip.\n* **Transcription & Storage:** Post transcription, results are stored in DynamoDB.\n* **Worker Coordination:** We integrated HTTP handlers using AWS Lambda for easy access by workers to the queue and table.\n\n**Deployment:**\n\nWith our inference container and services ready, we leveraged SaladCloud\u2019s [**Public API**](https://docs.salad.com/reference/api-reference). We used the API to deploy 2 identical container groups with 100 replicas each, all using the modest RTX 3060 with only 12GB of vRAM. We filled the job queue with urls to the 2.2 million audio clips included in the dataset, and hit start on our container groups. Our tasks were completed in a mere 15 hours, incurring **$89** in costs from Salad, and **$28** in costs from our batch framework.\n\nThe result? An average transcription rate of **one hour of audio every 16.47 seconds**, translating to an impressive **$0.00059 per audio minute**.\n\nTranscription minutes per dollar:\n\n1. SaladCloud: 1681\n2. Deepgram - Whisper: 227\n3. Azure AI speech - Default model: 60\n4. Azure AI speech - Custom model: 41\n5. AWS Transcribe - Default model: 18\n6. AWS Transcribe - Custom model: 15\n\nWe tried to set up an apples-to-apples comparison by running our same batch inference architecture on AWS ECS\u2026but we couldn\u2019t get any GPUs. The GPU shortage strikes again.\n\nYou can read the full benchmark here (although most of it is already described here):\n\n[https://blog.salad.com/whisper-large-v2-benchmark/](https://blog.salad.com/whisper-large-v2-benchmark/) ",

It works really well for converting speech to text. But  recently, I saw a message saying that the current method I use is  legacy and suggesting I use a new method at [this other link](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat).

After [sharing it on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38611700) last week, the GH repo is at 900+ stars, and people have been using it e.g. to help with [music production in Ableton (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMmurtCkHI).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe application runs in the background, and is pretty simple to use:\n\n\\- Use a keyboard shortcut to take a screenshot of any active macOS window.\n\n\\- Either type or speak your question, which is sent to to OpenAI along with the screenshot.\n\n\\- The OpenAI Vision response is presented in-context/overlayed over the active window, and spoken to you as audio.\n\n\\- The app keeps running in the background, only taking a screenshot/listening when activated by the keyboard shortcut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's built with NodeJS/Electron, and uses OpenAI Whisper, Vision and TTS APIs under the hood. The app is free to clone, just bring your own API key.\n\nThere's a simple demo and a longer walk-through of how to get started in a few minutes in the [GH repo readme](https://github.com/elfvingralf/macOSpilot-ai-assistant), and I also [published a new demo on Twitter today](https://twitter.com/ralfelfving/status/1738222523895226438) showing both the voice + text input options.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/18oj53f/video/44v6oburkv7c1/player",

Right now I'm working with faster-whisper, but I know that for example WhisperJAX or insanely-fast-whisper exist as well and it seems like they perform much better than faster-whisper.\n\nWhat version do you suggest, even aside from these I've mentioned? A few more info:\n- I need it to work both on CPU and GPU (I plan to improve my setup soon, but I'd also like to be able to share my script and have it working regardless of the device's performance).\n- I need it to be run locally and for free, no API or payment whatsoever.\n- I'd like it to be an \"on-going\" project: I'm not that sure, but I think I read that WhisperJAX and insanely-fast-whisper are not being further developed.\n- Diarization and/or per-word timestamps would be two awesome additions, but not mandatory.\n\nThank you for any reply!",

        "body": "Hey Reddit!\n\nI'm the creator of easywhisper, an audio transcription app for windows and MacOs that makes audio transcription simple and accessible. While I'm proud of my product, I understand that not everyone wants to or can pay for a transcription service. That's why I decided to write this guide.\n\nThis post is for those of you who prefer a DIY approach or simply can't justify the cost of a paid solution right now. I believe in the power of open-source tools and want to share how you can set up a free, private, and unlimited transcription system on your own computer using OpenAI's Whisper. It can recognize speech in numerous languages and convert it to text. According to tests, it works best with these languages: English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Polish, Catalan, Japanese, German, Russian\n\nYes, this might mean fewer people will use easywhisper, but I'm okay with that. My goal is to help as many people as possible benefit from this amazing technology, whether through my app or through their own setup.\n\nSo, if you're tech-savvy, have some time on your hands, and want to dive into the nitty-gritty of speech recognition, this guide is for you. It's not as user-friendly as easywhisper, but it's free and gives you full control over the process.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\n# Below, I'll describe the step-by-step setup process\n\n>All of this was done on a MacBook Pro M1 Pro 32 GB with macOS Ventura 13.2.1, but experiments show that 16GB of memory is quite sufficient on processors M1 and above. When working on Windows, a dedicated graphics card may be required for acceptable performance.\n\n\n\n**0. Environment Setup**\n\nYou'll need Python3.10, git, and clang. Python3.10 is already included with macOS.  \nTo install git and clang (if you don't have them yet), run the command\n\n`xcode-select --install`\n\nNow we need to set up a virtual environment for Python, where we'll install all packages and libraries. To do this, execute the following commands:\n\n`python3.10 -m venv whisper && cd whisper`  \n`source bin/activate`\n\n**1. Installing whisper.cpp**\n\nwhisper.cpp is a C++ implementation of Whisper. It's worth using this instead of the original Whisper from OpenAI, as it works significantly faster. At the same time, it uses the same neural network models as OpenAI.\n\nWe download the repository with whisper.cpp, build the program, and download the largest (large-v1) model from OpenAI:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git && cd \n    whisper.cpp\n    make\n    ./models/download-ggml-model.sh large-v1\n\nAt this stage, you can already try to transcribe an audio recording to text by executing the following command\n\n    ./main -m models/ggml-large-v1.bin -l ru --no-timestamps -f ~/output.wav -of output -otxt\n\nThe parameters mean the following:\n\n* \\`-m\\` \u2014 path to the model file\n* \\`-l\\` \u2014 language\n* \\`--no-timestamps\\` \u2014 don't output time stamps in the transcript (leave only text)\n* \\`-f\\` \u2014 path to the audio file in wav format\n* \\`-of\\` \u2014 name of the file with the transcript (without extension!)\n* \\`-otxt\\` \u2014 output in txt format (text file)\n\nIf your audio file is not in .wav format, you can convert it using the ffmpeg utility:\n\n    ffmpeg -i audio1470766962.m4a -ar 16000 output.wav\n\n  \n**2. Installing libraries for speaker recognition**\n\nTo segment the audio file into segments with each speaker's speech separately, we'll need the following:\n\n* pywhispercpp \u2014 Python bindings to whispercpp, so we can use fast model application in C++ right from Python.\n* pyannote-audio \u2014 a set of libraries for dividing the audio stream into segments and for recognizing individual speakers in it.\n* pyannote-whisper \u2014 a wrapper around pyannote-audio to use trained language models from Whisper.\n\nTo install all of this, we execute the following commands:\n\n    pip3 install openai-whisper pywhispercpp pyannote-audio\n\nMost likely, the installation of pyannote-audio will fail with an error when building the hmmlearn package, with approximately the following text\n\n    note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.\n    error: legacy-install-failure\n    \u00d7 Encountered error while trying to install package.\n    \u2570\u2500> hmmlearn\n    note: This is an issue with the package mentioned above, not pip.\n    hint: See above for output from the failure.\n\nTherefore, we'll have to install the dependencies manually using the following commands:\n\n    pip3 install pytorch_lightning==1.6 torch-audiomentations==0.11.0 asteroid-filterbanks==0.4\n    pyannote.metrics==3.2 pyannote.pipeline==2.3 speechbrain torchaudio==2.0.0 torch==2.0.0 hmmlearn==0.2.6\n    pip3 install pyannote.audio --no-deps\n\nFinally, we download pyannote-whisper:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/yinruiqing/pyannote-whisper.git && cd pyannote-whisper\n\n  \n**3. Setting up the model for audio file segmentation**\n\nNow we need to download the model from pyannote-audio that will parse the audio file into segments and the model configuration file. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Register on the HuggingFace website\n2. Download the model file segmentation/pytorch\\_model.bin\n3. Download the configuration file config.yaml\n4. Save both files in the pyannote-whisper directory\n5. Edit the following fields in the config.yaml file\n   * Set pipeline.params.embedding\\_batch\\_size to 1\n   * In pipeline.params.segmentation, specify the name of the pytorch\\_model.bin file\n\nAs a result, the config.yaml file should look like this:\n\n    ```yaml\n    pipeline:\n      name: pyannote.audio.pipelines.SpeakerDiarization\n      params:\n       clustering: AgglomerativeClustering\n       embedding: speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb\n       embedding_batch_size: 1 # reduction from 32 to 1 suddenly significantly speeds up the process, hint found in issues on github\n       embedding_exclude_overlap: true\n       segmentation: pytorch_model.bin # name of the model file\n       segmentation_batch_size: 32\n    \n    \n    params:\n      clustering:\n       method: centroid\n       min_cluster_size: 15\n       threshold: 0.7153814381597874\n      segmentation:\n       min_duration_off: 0.5817029604921046\n       threshold: 0.4442333667381752\n\n\n\n**4. Running the code for audio transcription and segmentation**\n\nAfter this, having all the libraries, models, and config, all that's left is to execute the Python code that will process the audio file.\n\nSave the following code in the pyannote-whisper directory in a file called diarize.py.\n\n    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline\n    from pyannote_whisper.utils import diarize_text\n    from pywhispercpp.model import Model\n    \n    # Specify the path to the config file, it should be in the same directory as mentioned in step 3.\n    pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(\"config.yaml\")\n    \n    # Specify the name of the large-v1 model and the path to the directory with whisper models from step 1.\n    model = Model('large-v1', '/Users/guschin/whisper.cpp/models', n_threads=6)\n    \n    # Specify the path to the audio file that we'll transcribe to text.

To complete the task, I need word-level timestamps to accurately map and synchronize the words with the audio.

I've found myself playing with voice control in home assistant, which by default uses the fast\\_whisper implementation, and the biggest model I can run in a way that the experience is not horrible is the small\\_int8 one, which takes 2-2.5s to process a command. Some light research seems to indicate that faster\\_whisper does not leverage any GPU other than nvidia.\n\nBut the 12th gen i3 has an ARC-based iGPU that while not stellar, it should be way better that using the CPU. But I couldn't find much information on how to run whisper or any other related sibling on intel hardware anywhere (I'm running proxmox on this machine, in case that matters).\n\nHas anyone managed to get any whisper-like models to run on ARC gpus (I assume that if it works on the discrete ones, it should also work on the integrated ones with the same architecture)?\n\nMy main use case is being able to process audio using a more accurate model than small\\_int8 faster.",

The GPUs are crowdsourced Nvidia RTX series GPUs.\n\nIn this period, we successfully transcribed over 2 million audio files, totalling nearly 8000 hours in length. **The test incurred around $100 in SaladCloud costs** and less than $10 on both AWS and Cloudflare.\n\n# Most cost-effective GPU for long audio (>30 secs): RTX 3060\n\nAmong the 20 GPU types, based on the current datasets, the RTX 3060 stands out as the most cost-effective GPU type for long audio files exceeding 30 seconds. **Priced at $0.10 per hour** on SaladCloud, it can transcribe nearly **200 hours of audio per dollar**.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1u2l0xg4nic1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c67006f752c7fe4794db52b1628f60034d756ff\n\n# Most cost-effective GPU for short audio (<30 secs): Multiple GPUs\n\nFor short audio files lasting less than 30 seconds, several GPU types exhibit similar performance, transcribing approximately **47 hours of audio per dollar.**\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ditqb7bl4nic1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51484acbb170df699896856f5e0ebf5feba88174\n\n# Best performing GPU for long audio (>30 secs): RTX 4080\n\nThe RTX 4080 outperforms others as the best-performing GPU type for long audio files exceeding 30 seconds, boasting an average real-time factor of 40. This implies that the system can **transcribe 40 seconds of audio per second.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gp6il0p4nic1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bd64b47bd648b43126bb79968c94542d505f0f3\n\n# Best performing GPU for short audio (<30 secs): RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 4070 Ti & RTX 4090\n\nWhile for short audio files lasting less than 30 seconds, the best average real-time factor is approximately 8 by a couple of GPU types, indicating the ability to transcribe **8 seconds of audio in just 1 second.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ym4mpcdr4nic1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cc48542ed1b395b5a31a3cbdc49a52e428ea23d\n\n# Comparison of consumer GPUs with managed transcription services\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nc9jm3w4nic1.jpg?width=3408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53cfcdb2d5114c3aaffad2cc19195b28404f258f\n\n With the most cost-effective GPU type for Whisper Large V3 inference on SaladCloud, **$1 dollar can transcribe 11,736 minutes of audio (nearly 200 hours)**, showcasing a **500-fold cost reduction compared to other public cloud providers**.\n\n# Advanced System Architecture for Batch Jobs\n\nOur batch processing framework comprises of the following:\n\n**GPU Resource Pool**: Hundreds of Salad nodes equipped with dedicated GPUs for downloading and transcribing audio files, uploading generated assets and reporting task results.\n\n* **Cloud Storage**: Audio files and generated assets stored in Cloudflare R2, which is AWS S3-compatible and incurs zero egress fees.\n* **Job Queue System:** The Salad nodes retrieve jobs via AWS SQS, providing unique identifiers and accessible URLs for audio clips in Cloudflare R2. Direct data access without a job queue is also possible based on specific business logic. A HTTP handler using AWS Lambda can be provided for easy access.\n* **Job Recording System**: Job results, including processing time, input audio URLs, output text URLs, etc., are stored in DynamoDB. A HTTP handler using AWS Lambda can be provided for easy access.\n\nWe aimed to keep the framework components fully managed and serverless to closely simulate the experience of using managed transcription services. A decoupled architecture provides the flexibility to choose the best and most cost-effective solution for each component from the industry.\n\nWithin each node in the GPU resource pool in SaladCloud, two processes are utilized following best practices: one dedicated to GPU inference and another focused on I/O and CPU-bound tasks, such as downloading/uploading, preprocessing, and post-processing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq6n1qtc4nic1.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=23e3b8daea85bd7c82815d5d0e397d9bb24703a6\n\n# You can read the full benchmark with the architecture & process here: [https://blog.salad.com/whisper-large-v3/](https://blog.salad.com/whisper-large-v3/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Not something that needs uploading files but an online website that takes voice input from my microphone and transcribes it live?\n\nI am familiar with the [Hugging Face online website](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Amrrs/openai-whisper-live-transcribe) as well as the other thousand million failed attempts such as [Whisper Playground](https://whisperui.monsterapi.ai/) (that eternally fails to connect to server) but the problem is that those have a limitation in the number of seconds that I have to speak and record (30 seconds or less).\n\nIt's important to note that I am just an average Joe. **I am not** a computing engineer, I did not attend MIT. I do not understand Github, I don't know how to use Python or any other coding programming language.\n\nWhat I basically need (and I believe tons of other people around the world) is something like the function of transcribing live audio that you find in Google Docs, but without all the million typing dumb mistakes that Google Docs makes, or something similar to Dragon NaturallySpeaking, but harnessing the accurate open-source power of Whisper. \n\nThanks in advance.",

This approach tailors the model to specific needs, significantly boosting transcription quality where generic models might falter.\n\nHowever, the process is complex due to several reasons:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Computational Cost: The training process demands costly GPU compute to efficiently manage large datasets and model iterations.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Technical Expertise: It requires an in-depth understanding of machine learning, audio processing, and neural networks to effectively modify the model.\n\nAt [**Monster API**](https://monsterapi.ai/signup?ref=trymonster) we have been cooking a solution to solve the problem of complex whisper finetuning pipeline setup and costly GPU compute!\n\nHere's what we have developed \ud83d\udc47\n\nA whisper finetuning API that accepts a simple hyperparameter and dataset payload and runs the whisper fine-tuning job to completion on our distributed low-cost GPU Cloud!\n\nTo make it more easily accessible and consumable, we have developed a Colab notebook (link in comment) with a 2-step implementation to build your custom finetuned Whisper model:\n\n* Step 1: Upload your tailored dataset on Hugging Face and provide its dataset path.\n* Step 2: Execute the fine-tuning script.\n\n\n\n**Here's the colab notebook to launch and manage your whisper finetuning jobs:**\n\n[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FAiAj3lD5a2PTcAUm-TVZwbdxBBvWG82](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FAiAj3lD5a2PTcAUm-TVZwbdxBBvWG82)\n\nThis method significantly reduces the complexity and resources typically required, making it accessible for developers to improve Whisper's performance on specialized tasks such as Indic dialects and non-english languages.\n\nIt's an ideal API for applications that demand high-quality, customized speech recognition capabilities.",

From the delicious taste, satisfying texture, and visually appealing appearance to the enticing scent of cinnamon, this cereal presents an alluring breakfast option for children.\n\nThe second time I transcribed, it didn't include all the extra text like before. It rarely goes crazy like this, but wow, that is a lot of extra craziness.",

Other people that do might already know that if it doesn't detect input or is having trouble it assigns high probability to some phrases that it clearly heard a lot while training.\n\n\\- \"Thanks for watching\"\n\n\\- \"Hit that like button\"\n\n\\- \"I love you\"\n\n\\-etc\n\nI've gotten a link once, and it was for the open AI help page.

I haven't seen a site like this in years.\n\nI wanted to know what types of thing you've run into? Can anyone beat my weird link? and can anyone explain, why the orange power ranger? How much orange power ranger content is there in the training data that it is on the same level as \"thanks for watching\"?",

        "body": "I'm aware Whisper isn't the most frequently used OpenAI product but as a learner of languages and big enjoyer of random, obscure non English content (yes I'm a nerd, aren't we all here) Whisper is truly a godsend in what it can do and I can't wait to see the improvements in such technology as years move forward. Recently me and my girlfriend have been pushing the limits of Whisper (using it in Subtitle Edit with Const-Me as the engine and translate to English turned on) and I usually get great results. Tonight we tested it using a news report in Hakka, a language spoken in China and Taiwan among other places using Chinese as the language it was set to, and it got in essentially an infinite loop for a time for large parts of the report, seemingly taken 3 words it had accurately understood but then almost creating its own translation and sentence based on that rather than the video which ended up very inaccurate to what was actually said, and then repeating this for multiple lines of subtitles as seen in the picture attached rather than interpreting and translating the actual news report. I'm aware this is not a language Whisper is designed to be able to understand, however I have had very surprisingly accurate results with languages like Alsatian, Swiss German, which are both very distinctive and often considered their own languages, and most surprisingly it was getting a surprisingly high, if not perfect, level of comprehension in Taiwanese Hokkien, none of which are listed as supported in Subtitle Edit. I've noticed both today and in other uses that Whisper sometimes does this, of repeating a line over and over for multiple lines of subtitles and not actually listening, transcribing and then translating the video given and for a time repeating over and over one line which is often to some degree inaccurate. Does anyone know why it's doing this, is there anything I can do to fix this and improve accuracy? I'm aware using a language which isn't included in the big list Whisper is said to support on the Subtitle Edit GUI probably isn't helping, but I'm sure it's done this for other bigger and supported languages as well for me, not just this case, but I sadly don't remember the specific uses. Is there an element of user error here, and anything I can do to fix and improve it, or is this just the limits of the technology in its current state? Any help and advice would be appreciated :)    \n\n\nOn the off chance anyone here speaks Hakka or wants to experiment using the same video I did, here is the link of the news report we were using:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m888cXi7z-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m888cXi7z-8)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n[The result of Whisper in Subtitle edit ](https://preview.redd.it/zmhygq00vxlb1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5db7d080ec5bfc9548de8ee0083861b9ca51b2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Zoomed in on the repeating Result ](https://preview.redd.it/gpop2s3fvxlb1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcfc8556ef2d32e1353d8d5bcecff3c61ffd932b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Whisper settings ](https://preview.redd.it/h4xh24mjvxlb1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8562f31c369d2d308fbb31ab3932225b1039ea3)",

I've ran Whisper (large model) on standard audio (podcasts etc) and it does an incredible job at transcribing into subtitles. \n\nHowever, when I feed it songs, it seems to struggle with lyrics. Often it'll be a bunch of nonsense. \n\nI guess the model hasn't been trained on music? Has anyone had any success transcribing music? Is the new V3 better?\n\nThanks! ",

I am new to these, I know that there is Macwhisper but I would like to have access to the pro features of Whisper such as Large and medium models in English and also other languages and seeing that you can also have the pro features of Macwhisper with some coding in Terminal etc,  I am looking if I can do that by using the large and medium models in Terminal codes or other apps if possible. But I am very new to this. I tried whisper.cpp from github but it only converts audio files of wav extension with 16khz. I am not sure if converting to 16khz wav  takes anything from the quality of the sound. I would like to transcribe mp3 and mp4 (video) files with large and medium models. I came across some other models of Whisper in github which seem faster and which are the better versions of it I think, but I guess they are all based on Windows versions because they involve components of Nvidia to be installed?

It can be tedious to remove them manually, and automatic solutions such as using sound thresholds, or plugins like RX10 breath control, are not very reliable (you inevitably have to accept quite a lot of false negatives and/or positives depending on your settings).\n\nI was wondering, since whisper can identify which bits of an audio file correspond to which words, maybe it could intelligently identify what is a breath? One common false positive in these plugins is quiet or mouth noisy sounds that are actually part of a word - maybe having a transcript in there as part of the process could help such a system identify that this is part of a word and not a breath. \n\nHow much hacking would it take to get something like this working with openAI tools?",

Some of this recorded content already has subtitles, but a lot of it doesn't.\n\n**What I want**\n\nI want Whisper AI to more accurately transcribe audio related to this niche topic. Ideally, I would like to do this for multiple languages, starting with English and Spanish (as those are the two that I speak) and eventually adding more. I think this could be achieved by fine-tuning the Whisper AI model (starting with the largest model available, as memory usage/size is not an issue at this level) by giving it additional training on a large corpus of tagged audio related to this topic.\n\n**What I plan to do next**\n\nI can run Whisper AI on the recorded content that I have (the part that doesn't already have subtitles) and then manually adjust any errors. If things go well, I plan to scale this project up by recruiting other people to help with this manual correction process. Then I'll have a whole bunch of audio with its subtitles, and this could be useful in its own right, as subtitled videos on YouTube and full-text transcriptions available for download by those who want to read it rather than (or in addition to) watching it.\n\n**What I need help with**\n\nI don't know how to go from subtitled video (or captioned audio) over to a dataset that can be used to fine-tune Whisper AI. If I'm understanding things correctly, what I want to do is create an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) database like those found [here at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_categories=task_categories:automatic-speech-recognition&sort=downloads). So maybe I need to look at two routes of how to get there. First, how could I take subtitled videos and use that linked text/audio data to add to an ASR database? Second, how could I go most seamlessly from Whisper AI to some manual corrections then into that same ASR database? I think I would need to add tags to the data, at the very least the language being spoken, in addition to putting it all in to some kind of database with ids. Are there tools available to help with this process?",

        "body": "Sometimes when transcribing audio files, particularly with some silence in them (even just a couple of seconds), the Whisper API will get stuck on a phrase and keep repeating it, sometimes for several pages. Then, it will pick back up far ahead of where it got stuck. I've also seen this happen with whisper.cpp and have seen it repeat itself most of the way through a two-hour file, but it happens less often and if I re-transcribe the same audio, it doesn't get stuck the next time. The Whisper API does consistently get stuck on the same audio files, usually at the same spot. I tried writing to the billing team about this, didn't get a reply for months, then got told to try deleting my browser's cashe.\n\nMy browser.\n\nFor an API.\n\nYep.\n\nI've started splitting files into 20-minute chunks, and that seems to help (and means I can just re-transcribe the chunk that goes wrong), but now I'm sometimes getting results that have little to no punctuation. Again, running the same audio through whisper.cpp produces a perfect transcript.\n\nFor the moment I have no good hardware for running whisper.cpp, and it's going at near-realtime on a laptop with integrated graphics. I'm going to change this soon, but for now, it'd be great if the API worked ... and didn't charge me money for garbage results. It's not much, but with the number of times I've had to re-run some of these files, it adds up.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing any of this (I assume yes), and if so, do we know why, or what can be done about it?",

I know that using the API will automatically link the usage to your account billing, but when using it with the WhisperX library, which doesn't even need to link an account, you don't have to pay for anything. I'm gonna go ahead and guess that this is because you are loading the model locally and using the processing power of your machine, but I would like a confirmation on this. Another thing, I didn't explore much the API part but with Python I can load different models that have different qualities, resulting in better transcriptions. Is this the case with the API as well? If so, is there a definitive better way to use Whisper or does it depend on your case?",

One thing that complicates the issue is that there may be a delay of up to 1 second between the files. I kind of solved the delay part and take this into account when matching the transcripts but it's still glitchy. \n\nI have a third audio file which contains the conversation containing both speakers with appropriate synchronization and whisper performs great on this, but the issue being is that I would need to use speaker diarisation which is also unreliable.\n\nI've been using stable\\_whisper as it was less buggy than whisper\\_timestamped because whisper segments would sometimes need to be split. For example, in the sample transcription above, both lines from Person 1 may be identified as a single segment.",

With ai-utils.js, you have complete control over the prompts, the model settings, and the control flow of your application.\n\n\\- Integrate support features: Essential features like logging, retries, throttling, and error handling are integrated and easily configurable.\n\nYou can check out the code here: [https://github.com/lgrammel/ai-utils.js](https://github.com/lgrammel/ai-utils.js)\n\nIt's different from other libraries in that it gives you full control over your prompts. In my opinion putting prompts into your LLM library is like putting DB schemas into your ORM library - it might be helpful at first, but you will need to customize them anyways because they end up being application specific.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "I'm using Whisper to generate subtitles for archives of old public-access TV footage, a lot of which is shot by documentary crews outdoors without the best equipment, sometimes amid crowds etc, and the hosts or interview subjects are sometimes yelling over things. I'm wondering if there's any tool, ideally a freeware command-line one, I could use to pre-process the audio to make it easier for Whisper to handle.\n\nObviously Whisper already detects speech on its own, so maybe its own functionality is as good as things can reasonably get here. But I'm clueless on the subject and figured it couldn't hurt to ask. My Google searches mostly turn up things for separating vocals from music, or tutorials on manually removing consistent noise like hums and static rather than irregular interruptions like crowds or traffic. Processing time is no concern.\n\nThanks to anyone who can offer a tip.",

When I use the whisper transcribe feature, it seems to be translating my English speech into Arabic, my local language. I didn\u2019t expect this and, to be honest, it\u2019s not something I want.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to look for a language setting within the app to maybe change this behavior, but so far I haven\u2019t found anything relevant. I\u2019d prefer for the app to transcribe in English only, as that\u2019s the language I\u2019m speaking.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem or found a solution to it? Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

Rap songs, low quality recordings, multi language conversations, everything seemed to work really well! Unfortunately the setup process required you to install a bunch of dependencies to then have to use Terminal for transcribing audio. Last week I made a very easy to use Mac app to solve this, MacWhisper!\n\nQuickly and easily transcribe audio files into text with OpenAI's state-of-the-art transcription technology Whisper. Whether you're recording a meeting, lecture, or other important audio, MacWhisper quickly and accurately transcribes your audio files into text.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Easily record and transcribe audio files\n* Just drag and drop audio files to get a transcription\n* Get accurate text transcriptions in seconds (\\~15x realtime)\n* Search the entire transcript and highlight words\n* Supports multiple languages (fastest model is English only)\n* Copy the entire transcript or individual sections\n* Supports Tiny (English only), Base and Large models\n* Reader Mode\n* Edit and delete segments from the transcript\n* Select transcription language (or use auto detect)\n* Supported formats: mp3, wav, m4a and mp4 videos.\n* .srt & .vtt export\n\n**Which version do you need?**\n\nYou can download MacWhisper or MacWhisper Pro. MacWhisper Pro includes the Large model which offers the best transcription available right now and has industry leading accuracy but takes a lot longer to generate. The regular version of MacWhisper uses the Tiny (English only) and Base models, which are still very accurate and fast. Depending on your usecase you might want to use the Pro version. You can always change what version you want later.\n\nGumroad has a 250MB file size limit for apps that are listed for free so I had to make that part paid. Select **MacWhisper Pro** from the sidebar and pay 6 or more to get it.\n\n[https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper)",

Do I just run the code as is? I have an OpenAI API I can use, from the beta days. Can you help me understand the best process/tutorial to doing this?

This is still a beta version to be tested by as many passionate travellers as possible.\n\nTherefore, we are calling on all of you to submit a test review using the HolidayCheck assistant with the beta version. The submitted reviews will not go online but will be used to make the functionality even better. All participants will be entered into a raffle: This is done automatically once you interact with the assistant, and it generates reviews for you.\n\nLast few weeks we worked on prototype to understand how we can Revitalize User Generated Content with Al and ChatGPT / OpenAl Whisper.\n\nWith over 10 million reviews and holiday photos, HolidayCheck is the largest travel review portal in the German-speaking area. Every day, users upload their holiday impressions, giving other holidaymakers guidance when deciding on and booking their next destination. What is the hotel environment like, the food, the beach, the entertainment? Are there things that could be improved or was the holiday generally positive?\nAll these reviews are extremely helpful for holiday makers. They provide additional information, transparency and help in the decision-making process when going through a wealth of offers. \n\nTo create a detailed and thus helpful rating, the holiday maker must take some time to evaluate the individual categories, including the location, surrounding area, rooms, food, entertainment, and the hotel in general.\n\nSubmit a test review: Writing reviews will be easier and faster in the future",

This technology is going to reshape society. Soon, there won't be a job that isn't done by AI. It's going to disrupt and change everything. AI powered robots will take every job. To offset the mass layoffs, UBI will be implemented. All diseases will be cured. People will no longer age. Working will be optional. We will reverse global warming and become completely carbon neutral. We will begin colonizing the moon. The next decade is gonna be one of the best yet.

        "body": "I predict AI will be able to do anything but will be stopped by laws and popular pressure, since people don't wanna be mass unemployed. Severe restrictions will be rolled out and AI will be essentially used to aid your work, not to replace you, and companies that use it to replace you will be fined mad money. \n\nThat's essentially what's going to happen, and essentially the only thing that can realistically happen. You can get rid of a few careers every decade or so and replace them with something else, but you can't just put everyone out of jobs. You can't say to people \"sorry, you will have to live a meaningless life because whatever you would love to do, a machine can already do it\".\n\nKeep in mind this technology is feeding off people's minds. You're literally using what i say, what you say, what others say, to create thing thing. This will be taken into consideration and used to shut down or limit AI operations.\n\nI honestly believe technology isn't always good, even if most of the time it is.

The statistical shortcut approach that is so successful in first level processing of verbiage will be extended to motor skills, location awareness, emotion detection, fact and logic verification and many other humanlike qualities. The difficult part will be the recursive self verification process for all of these things, just as it is now with chatGPT. \n\nIt will also eventually force humanity to realize that there's a lot less to our intelligence than we think since neural net training (i.e. a lifetime of childhood play) essentially creates all these statistical shortcuts in the human brain, and we'll have to admit that the difference between us and chatGPT is ... less than you might think.",

        "body": "There's 0% chance that the current trajectory of AI doesn't lead to either mass regulation or mass insanity, war, and destruction. \n\nAll these super rosy takes about \"Everything is gonna be AI generated and everything is happily ever\" are short-sighted. The writers of these takes imagine what that looks like as a static moment in the future, but they never answer the question \"and then what?\" Putting humanity in such a state would be similar to putting them in a black hole. It'd be cool for like a millisecond before everything collapses.  \n\n\nMy optimistic projection (because it may go even worse) is that we're currently at a saddle point of AI development where there's two ways things could go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Efforts to detect and filter AI largely fail and the entire internet becomes a cesspool of AI generated garbage that gets worse with each successive generation because the AI is training on itself, and the version of reality it produces keeps diverging from the version that humans share. People will enjoy the novelty of it for a short while, maybe a few years, but eventually the internet as medium itself will be regarded as complete BS. It will become sorta like a casino -- it's fun to go for a little while but everyone knows that nothing in it can be taken seriously, it's 100% a self-evident fraud, and those who have a positive outlook on it are largely considered suckers by society. People who touted \"prompt engineering\" as a true skill become a laughing stock as the entire web is a huge feedback loop of language AI generating prompts for other language AI, generating prompts for image and video AI producing content captioned by AI, which makes new prompts for the language AI, ad nauseam. It will pejoratively become simply known as \"the feed\" and it will eventually be shut down, either voluntarily or by force, before undergoing a hard reboot.\n2. Efforts to detect and filter AI largely succeed, and the internet becomes a collection of walled garden communities where certificate authority like entities authenticate human identity and then exclude members that produce AI generated content. People who are attracted to the AI section of the internet steadily lose their minds in the real world relative to those who avoid it. They have no identity except that of a content consumer, they largely are considered suckers, and ultimately they don't produce offspring because the only conversation they are capable of having is \"check out this AI generated\" BS that no one cares about\n\nHope I'm wrong but I know some of you know I'm right",

        "body": "Some ideas that come mind of how AI will impact our lives in the future:\n\n. There will be a diverse offer of AI assistants in the market, AI assistants will be a thing and will help humans in various tasks, AI assistants will interact with APIs so a command like \u201cpost a video of xyz on youtube\u201d, or \u201csend and email to x sirve the following\u2026\u201d or \u201cbuy this stock at this price\u201d all this will be possible, also they will interact with our PCs and Phone\u2019s operating systems.\n\n. AI will have a huge impact in human productivity making humans more productive boosting up our multitasking capabilities, humans that don\u2019t use AI will have a disadvantage.\n\n. AI will be used as a weapon, moral and ethic concerns will arise as a global trend, hackers will become more dangerous, systems will become more vulnerable.\n\n. Once humans adopt the use of AI in their daily lives, one limitation will be the speed and rate of communication humans will have with AI, this will incentivate solutions that use other faster methods of communication than Voice or text input and more solutions like Neuralink and others will arise, finally resulting in humans merging with AI a few decades from now.",

So many GPUs have been sold in the last few years that there is a ton of processing power out there that can be exploited by non-governmental entities - think BitTorrent for illegal AI. Also government and corporate reliance on AI over common sense will create huge opportunities for exploitation which will in turn decrease confidence in AI and restore reliance on the bureaucratic methods they have relied on for so long.\n\nNobody knew how to use firearms to their greatest efficiency for years after they were invented, it will take them a while to figure out how to regulate AI and in the meantime code spreads fast.",

This includes the ability for AI to intelligently group people together with compatible qualities, and help manage their time for social interaction. There may not be physically connected renaissance, but I will be a little surprised if there isn\u2019t a human connected one. Especially with millennials and older generations. Ai might fall short of being a fulfilling friend or partner because while they may act relatable there is no way for the human mind to believe that they truly are. It\u2019s very likely that many will choose to not care if who they are talking to on the internet is real or not, so as to enable this view. I see your point though, very much.

Second, those governments are not only \"influenced\" but typical laggards and totally lacking any vision or anticipating capabilities, i.e. the revolution will be unstoppable long before they'd start to raise an eyebrow. Third, but that's more a personal opinion, each time there were such fears of massive job stealing it happened way slower than claimed, took place with some transitions to new jobs, etc. I don't say it will even out, I'd say we still don't know, especially as some of these technologies still have a pretty significant margin for improvement before it can become reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and... affordable.",

There's literally zero chance you will have any sort of AI technology that creates very high unemployment, unless you can just give a shit load of money to the people.

Just more mouths to feed in trade of nothing.\n\nLets not even talk about the insane power to control everything and everyone this will give to companies and governments.

        "body": ">In this new world UBI will have to deliver not in the way that welfare   \ndoes i.e. safety net, but actually to ensure a high quality of life as   \npeople would reject it otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefine \"high quality of life\".\n\nCan i have 5 porsches and a mansion on UBI? No. But i'm pretty sure the elites can.\n\nYou see, \"money\" isn't everything humans search for. Humans like to achieve things. A lot of people genuinely love their careers. You're essentially killing dreams. I find it naive to think that won't create serious problems. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In future we could spend our time doing other meaningful things that revolve around connection and accomplishment.\n\nWhy do we talk about the future? We have unemployed people right now. We have retired people right now. We know what it looks like not having anything to do. Does it seem they're mostly spending time on meaningful things that revolve around connection and accomplishment? I think we may be overrating human's ability to find purpose and motivation without it being a requirement to climb the social economic ladder. If people had that ability, on a large scale, we would already be seeing it by now.\n\nLook at how many people become slaves of lazyness everytime they can. Look at how many people just can't stop looking at a FB feed, even while walking down the street. If you just don't have anything to do, and nothing is required from you, what are the chances you don't swallowed by the instant gratification rabbit hole?\n\nI also have a problem with a world where you're not needed at all. Because...if aren't needed, why keep you around? If most people aren't needed, why would the elites keep you around? They already control you completely through forced charity. They don't need anything from you.",

        "body": "I'd define a high quality of life where all your basic needs were easily met and you have plenty of time for leisure/family activities. A high quality of life, would mean things like happiness was self reported to be good by the population.\n\nYou don't need 5 Porsches. That's kind of dumb to even think that should be a measure of success. What you might be uncomfortable with is a society where there's no hierarchy of status (the real reason you want a Porsche) which we currently have with money/jobs/capital. Of course a new system of hierarchy would need to be created. Maybe this could be a more wholesome one where decent people of honourable character did better in life rather than those who just work hard/good with money.\n\nAs to your point about slaves to laziness, well it's already happening. We essentially have kept huge tranches of the population \"working\" from home. Most people like this because despite what they say they don't have to work hard and can easily slack off when they feel like it. It's UBI via the back door. Companies can manage with this becuase, guess what, so many business processes are now automated or heavily assisted by technology so only s few people are really needed. They just keep the rest hired to do a minimal supervisory role.",

Google and social media weren\u2019t around back then but it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine small handheld multimedia devices with screens would eventually be a thing. The touchscreens definitely were a surprise for me. \n\nI used to think about the future a ton, and a lot of my predictions have been way too conservative and are in fact going to happen in my lifetime and not hundreds of years from now.\n\nBut the one thing I have been waiting for since I was like 7 years old (and that we still seem nowhere near) is being able to drink and eat \u201cbad\u201d food that has been engineered to be nutritious. I totally thought that was gonna be a thing by the 2010s at the absolute latest. Like pizza and soda that is healthy for you lol. \n\nI eat clean these days and don\u2019t really crave that stuff like I did when I was a kid, but damn I am still surprised that we are all eating the exact same fast food in 2023 that I was eating in 1988.

        "body": "thx! so this mean the solution in the provided links is a closed source application....\n\nSo there are two missing parts...\n\n1. convert the text to a voice that sounds like the original speaker (but in different language)...\n\nThis would mean you would need to create something like a custom voice(s) (for multiple speakers)... not sure how this voice creation process is called. But probably no open source application supports this?\n\n2. Have the voice generated in a way so that it is in sync with the video?\n\nIs this a challenging step, I mean would it just be enough to generate the audiostream in the right speed or would it also need to subtly change the videostream in some way?",

The details for setting it up are in the diacritics area. A GPU is required for diacritics usage. \n\nI find it more accurate than professional machine captions.

        "body": "> Whisper infers text in a similar way to how an LLM does.\n\nWhisper is not just similar to an LLM, it is in fact an LLM. See the Whisper paper which covers all this clearly. It's two Transformers, and the text decoder half is just an LLM. It's like a NMT LLM except one 'language' is audio. So you can finetune the text half on a text corpus even without any audio to go with it to do stuff like teach it unusual words or proper nouns, and you can do standard interpretability research like extracting its bigrams or generating text. This is also why Whisper can do *translation* of spoken language, not just mere audio transcription - LLMs trained on enough multilingual data just learn that automatically. (It's not a very good LLM, similar to the one in CLIP, that is true. That's because it's deliberately kept small for speed so there's less benefit to investing in the text LLM, and because you want the audio half to do most of the 'work' instead of the text LLM making giant leaps of prediction that are highly plausible yet wrong. Nevertheless, that is what it is.)\n\nIt doesn't tend to confabulate as much as your familiar GPT-3 does, but that's simply because it's usually generating a quite small window of text (so not much room) and because it's being fed the audio embedding (which is usually very strong evidence, that renders all other text highly improbable and so unlikely to be generated - you would have to have a very large and specific prompt before pure text prompting provided enough evidence to tamp down confabulation as much as the audio embedding does).",

Whisper already runs with such a small footprint it could run locally on most modern devices. a 50% speedup with a small reduction in accuracy is pointless when Whisper already achieves instantaneous transcription with the full accuracy that it has. If you doubt that, use ChatGPT's advanced voice mode, where Whisper is still active, but only to transcribe the conversation between you and AVM. It's nearly instantaneous, it catches interruptions in flow, changes in speaker, etc, and it's doing it all in under 100ms",

        "body": "I've been using Whisper for ages, doing that copy and pasting, copy and pasting. I send long texts to do with work. I work in, oh, I might as well, it doesn't matter on here, I work in telehealth. So, I'm always getting messages from patients, and sometimes they have to be quite in-depth. I have to go back and put a paragraph here or there, a line space, but I think it's phenomenal, it's a game changer for me, an absolute game changer. It's a game changer, I don't know what else to say. Anyone who's using it, like I'm doing now, talking away to it, it just changes the way to communicate. It has to be integrated into a decent keyboard. I mean, personally, I choose the Gboard one, which unfortunately is owned by Google. I've also used the Swift one, but I fell out with that. But, like you said, this is a leap and bounds beyond what Gboard speech-to-text is like.",

You see this button at the bottom of the default GBoard keyboard? Just click it, select \"Dictate\" and Android will switch to the Dictate keyboard.

So I will have to speak English properly without any accent to make sure that the program works; otherwise, it will automatically translate  into my  own mother tongue.\n\nSo is there any way that no matter what accents  you're saying, the transcription is preserved in English?",

        "body": "Cool I actually had this same exact idea recently, I think youtube will soon incorporate something like this themselves though. On a related note, if you click the \"Show transcript\" button on a video, it includes the timestamps of every 2 lines, but a couple days ago it also had a Search bar at the top, but now it's gone. And when it was there, it didn't return any results even if it was an exact match on part of the transcript. So maybe they're already experimenting with it and accidentally released it when it wasn't finished. Another nice idea would be to include a summary of the entire video, which would be useful when you don't have time to watch it",

        "body": "At a high-level, the project works in the following way:\n\n1. Get the transcript of a Youtube video using the URL from the [youtube transcript api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api). \n2. If a transcript doesn\u2019t exist, download the audio of the video as an mp3 file with [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) and use our first ML model, [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe\n3. Break up transcript into shorter segments and convert segments to a 768 vector array. Use a process known as embedding using our second ML model, [UKP Labs BERT\u2019s sentence transformer model](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). \n4. Save vector array in a vector database, Atlas uses [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io/)\n5. Take the search phrase, embed the search phrase into a 768 vector array\n6. Use the vector database to see which transcript segment vector is [nearest](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/#distance-between-vectors) to our search phrase vector (more information on what [it means for a vector to be near](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/semantic-search/#vector-similarity-search)).\n7. Combine the search results to create a long form answer using our 3rd ML model, [BART LFQA](https://huggingface.co/vblagoje/bart_lfqa).\n\n[helpful diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Wnw88FP.png)\nedit: [a more detailed diagram](https://i.imgur.com/aXRsdSq.png) \n\n[More details on how it works](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atlas#how-atlas-works)\n\n[OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is a model that transcribes audio to text.",

        "body": "Not sure if anyone will read this but if anyone is curious exactly how temperature works:\n\nLLMs don't output a next token. They output a probability for every possible token in its dictionary, and one of them is randomly sampled. So continuing the sentence \n\n\"The cat in the \"\n\nThe LLMs output might be something like \n\nHat: 80% \nHouse: 5% \nBasket: 4% \nBest: 4%\n...\nPhotosynthesis: 0.0001%\n\nAnd so forth, for every single token that the LLM is capable of outputting (there are thousands), such that the probabilities add up to 100%. What then happens is then one of those tokens is randomly chosen according to their probability. So \"hat\" would be chosen 80% of the time etc. The consequence of that is that the output of the LLM does not have to be 100% deterministic, and there is some randomness introduced (on purpose - you could of course pick the top-1 likely token every single time and I think there's another API parameter for that).\n\nWhat the temperature parameter does is take the LLMs output probabilities, and skews them before randomly sampling.\n\nA temperature of one would keep the probabilities the same, introducing no skew.\n\nA temperature of less than one would skew the probabilities towards the most likely token. e.g.\n\nHat: 95% \nHouse: 2% \nBasket: 1% \nBest 0.5% \n...\nPhotosynthesis: 0.00000001% \n\nAnd a temperature of zero would skew the probabilities so heavily that the most likely token would be at 100%, which would mean complete determinism, and would result in a distribution like this \n\nHat: 100% \nHouse: 0% \nBasket: 0% \nBest 0% \n...\nPhotosynthesis: 0% \n\nWhile setting the temperature to exactly one would not skew the LLMs output during postprocessing, and keep the LLMs original probabilities (so, it's still a bit random, just not skewed).\n\nAnd conversely a temperature of over one would \"spread out\" the probabilities such that less likely words are now more likely, e.g.\n\nHat: 50% \nHouse: 30% \nBasket: 10% \nBest: 5% \n...\nPhotosynthesis: 0.1%\n\nToo high a temperature, and words that don't make sense become more likely, and you might get total nonsense (like asking it to write a poem and it starts outputting broken HTML).\n\nIt's not exactly \"creativity\", it's more about allowing the LLM to explore paths that it predicts occur less often in the training dataset (but that are not necessarily incorrect). Used within reason it can cause the LLM to generate more varied responses.\n\nDepending on your use case, a temp of zero (and not 1) might be optimal, when you want the most reliable and confident output, like when writing code or you need the output to adhere to a format. But increasing the temp and running the output multiple times also might let you see new ways of doing things. For creative writing or generating ideas or names etc. where there's no \"best\" answer, a higher temp would definitely be useful.",

        "body": "You should add that setting temperature at \"0\" on OpenAI models makes it so that it doesn't consider any alternative probabilities at all. Useful for when you need consistent outputs. Also it's a common misconception that the temp only goes up to 1. Some websites (including [nat.dev](https://nat.dev)) for some reason deliberately limit the temp slider to 1.0 max which only fuels the confusion. Wouldn't hurt to specify that the true supported range is \\[0; 2\\] and default is 1.0 (ChatGPT settings might be different than API but not by much)\n\nPS. As a side note, from what I saw I would say the most usable 'production' range temperature for a GPT4 chatbot is 0.6-1.3. Within that you can safely play with it while you still consider both accurate and creative tasks. Outside of it, you are starting to move into niche tasks territory degrading overall generalist tasks performance if top\\_p remains at 1.\n\nGreat work btw!",

        "body": "Fascinating post, thanks for writing that up. Obviously \"creativity\" is very difficult to define, and will be subjective in lots of ways. \n\nWhat's intersting to me is you've described a process that roughly maps with some elements of human creativity - as you said yourself, higher temps could be useful in that space for ideation/creative writing, etc. \n\nMy own experience with LLMs in a creative space is that they tend to be quite cliched and trope-reliant, at first. It's interesting to consider how a structure designed to reflect high probabilities will inevitably lead to that. It's equally interesting how \"creativity\" can kind of be brute-forced in this manner, too. As a rough example: If I ask GPT to give me 20 ideas for a short horror film, the first suggestions will be the tropiest/most cliched, but if I ask it to give me 200, it does start to get noticeably more adventurous as it works down the list of probabilities. \n\nWhile there's obviously more to human creativity than just this process, when I do stuff like this and read posts like yours it can sometimes feel to me like we're pulling back the veil quite a bit on a range of things from human cognition to culture.",

        "body": "> a temp of zero might be optimal when writing code\n\nI've actually found higher (but not maxed out) temperatures to be better when writing code. You should dial up the temperature slider when you want the thing to do any sort of generative task, whether that's crafting poems, drafting a letter, or writing code. These aren't things that can be looked up in an encyclopedia. They require imagination. You're asking GPT to *generate* something new.\n\nThe tasks that benefit from lower temperatures are the ones where you want it to spit straight facts at you with minimal hallucinations. Asking it questions about scientific findings, legal stuff, etc. all fall into this category and benefit greatly from lower temps.",

        "body": "I think certain parameters in the API are more useful than others. Personally, I haven't come across a use case for frequency\\_penalty or presence\\_penalty.\n\nHowever, for example, logit\\_bias could be quite useful if you want the LLM to behave as a classifier (output only either \"yes\" or \"no\", or some similar situation).\n\nBasically logit\\_bias tells the LLM to prefer or avoid certain tokens by adding a constant number (bias) to the likelihood of each token. LLMs output a number (referred to as a logit) for each token in their dictionary, and by increasing or decreasing the logit value of a token, you make that token more or less likely to be part of the output. Setting the logit\\_bias of a token to +100 would mean it will output that token effectively 100% of the time, and -100 would mean the token is effectively never output. You may think, why would I want a token(s) to be output 100% of the time? You can for example set multiple tokens to +100, and it will choose between only those tokens when generating the output.\n\nOne very useful usecase would be to combine the temperature, logit\\_bias, and max\\_tokens parameters.\n\nYou could set:\n\n\\`temperature\\` to zero (which would force the LLM to select the top-1 most likely token/with the highest logit value 100% of the time, since by default there's a bit of randomness added)\n\n\\`logit\\_bias\\` to +100 (the maximum value permitted) for both the tokens \"yes\" and \"no\"\n\n\\`max\\_tokens\\` value to one\n\nSince the LLM typically never outputs logits of >100 naturally, you are basically ensuring that the output of the LLM is ALWAYS either the token \"yes\" or the token \"no\". And it will still pick the correct one of the two since you're adding the same number to both, and one will still have the higher logit value than the other.\n\nThis is very useful if you need the output of the LLM to be a classifier, e.g. \"is this text about cats\" -> yes/no, without needing to fine tune the output of the LLM to \"understand\" that you only want a yes/no answer. You can force that behavior using postprocessing only. Of course, you can select any tokens, not just yes/no, to be the only possible tokens. Maybe you want the tokens \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"neutral\" when classifying the sentiment of a text, etc.",

I want to master these parameters. I want to understand what do they mean and how does it affect the LLM output. I want to learn them by heart as it's extremely important for my job. I also need to explain these parameters to my juniors. Also, use real world practical examples. It's always a good idea to show how something works by showing before and after. Example, temp=0 text goes here,\ntemp=1 text goes here\n\nFirst come up with a plan on how you will tackle this task. Once I approve, you will generate the explanation.\n---\nI want to further simplify what these parameters mean. There are going to be a lot of non technical folks who will attend my talk. Can you write more about what these parameters mean and how they affect the LLM output?\n---\nGreat job! Alright. Do the following:\n1. Let's add some humor and wit to make my talk interesting.\n2. Create an introduction and conclusion section\n3. Describe what each parameters do before explaining with examples\n4. Use teaching ideas to make sure these concepts sticks in users mind. \n5. Finally, mimic how a human writer would write\n6. Refer to popular Ted talks for inspiration.",

Sometimes one half of the solution is better than the other half in a given run, or it finds some trick to a particular part of the solution in one run but not another, so running it multiple times and combining the results can give great results.",

The one upvoted correct comment had responses like, bias is not bad because it's base on real life.

That's pretty insane considering you could ask it any conceivable question, or to classify the data into any arbitrary categories you like. I'm sure an LLM fine tuned on a particular dataset would outperform a non-finetuned ChatGPT, but that's amazing nonetheless. \n\nI haven't seen how Humata works, but yeah you could easily get this to work to answer any yes/no question about your PDF just by changing the prompt. And the LLM's output would be machine readable as well since the output is predictable, so you could integrate it into scripts or an automation pipeline.\n\nI'd probably use this technique even if I fine tuned it the model to output yes/no as an extra precaution anyway. Fine tuning would really shine if you're trying to squeeze out some additional accuracy, though you'd lose some of the flexibility as it would be tailored to your dataset in specific.",

        "body": "Yeah using an 8 B model helps. Unfortunately it has 3 steps to make before I hear the audio: Transcription, text generation, TTS. I stream the text in to the tts system which helps a bit but there\u2019s still more delay than I would like.\n\nThis is a cool project where they train an open source model on speech inputs so they can pass the audio data directly to the LLM skipping the transcription step,  very cool for anyone interested:\n\nhttps://github.com/tincans-ai/gazelle/blob/main/gazelle/modeling_gazelle.py",

Sure it can't do some things ChatGPT can do, but it's empowering me and saving me quite a bit of time and mental energy. I primarily program C++ in Unreal Engine which has a lot of boilerplate code all over the place and it does a pretty good job. Especially if I've written some code already. It helps completes for loops, if statements, and sometimes pretty good chunks of code. \n\n\nI use ChatGPT occasionally to toss ideas back and forth on various things. I occasionally ask it some programming questions. But I don't use it as much on daily basis for productivity purposes much recently.",

        "body": "I'm a software developer and my productivity is more or less the same. I use Copilot, it's fun but not a game changer. Chat GPT is also fun but it doesn't solve any complex problem for me. It failed me few times when I needed to understand some specific of a database engine or serialization framework by giving me completely made up answers. I realized that I cannot trust this thing, and I need to recheck everything it says.\n\nI also tried to use it in coding contests, and it failed. Chat GPT cannot solve medium level LeetCode problems.\n\nMy wife tried to use it to solve her math college homework. It helps to find the right solution sometimes but it makes lots of mistakes and can easily lead you in a wrong direction.\n\nLTTR, for me personally AI at the current stage is fun but nothing more. I believe GPT-4 may be a game changer",

        "body": "I have a five year old videogame fansite I built with WordPress because I know nothing about HTML. \n\nAnd after giving ChatGPT a temporary login, and working out, and explaining what I wanted, it dramatically increased the speed of my site with faster page loading, and got rid of a lot of unnecessary redundancy.\n\nIt also helped with some long standing design issues I was never able to find solutions for. \n\nI'm still stunned by how much it's helped me. Next, I plan on getting it to help tweak my overall site design. I couldn't be happier.\n\nUpdate: Alright folks, After GPT-3 offered me suggestions on changes to the site, I implemented the changes then asked it if there were any more it could offer. I followed what it said and after getting and running Hummingbird - one of several plugins from WPMU-DEV - I got the performance report which listed various css and javascript lines I could delete to help the pages load quicker.\n\nLong story short, I followed the instructions after showing those lines to gpt-3. After several hours going through all of it and running another speed test, my site was significantly better. But here's the thing, GPT-3 bamboozled me. It *never* had access to my site!\n\nIt turns out its initial suggestions were apparently general things that would help a wordpress site. By using Hummingbird and following the recommendations from it, then asking gpt-3 about those resources, and having it tell me about them, I then deleted some but not others.\n\nThe only thing that happened is that GPT-3 suggested a plugin that helps optimize sites and I followed its instructions. GPT-3 *did* help me understand *how* to safely delete those resources, but that's *all* it did.\n\nBasically, I got Tom Sawyered by GPT-3.\n\nSorry for anyone that got led astray by my initial excitement over how GPT helped me (I thought), with my Wordpress site.",

        "body": "Leaving this up as a warning not to be as gullible as I turned out to be.\n\n~~Yes, it did. Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. I'll be glad to let you know. The first thing I did was open a session with ChatGPT-3 and ask it if it could help with it and what could it do. It then gave me instructions on how to give it access. This was the response:~~\n\n>~~Here are some general steps you can follow to provide me with access to your WordPress site and hosting service:~~\n\n1. ~~Create a temporary admin account: In your WordPress site's dashboard, create a new temporary admin account with a unique username and strong password. Make sure to give this account only the necessary privileges needed for me to access your site's backend. Send me the login details: Once you have created the temporary admin account, send me the username and password via a private message. You can use a secure messaging platform like Signal, WhatsApp or email to send the details. Create a temporary SSH account: If your hosting service allows you to access your server via SSH, create a temporary SSH account with limited privileges. This will allow me to access your hosting service and make necessary changes. Make sure to give this account only the necessary privileges needed for me to access your hosting service.Send me the login details: Once you have created the temporary SSH account, send me the username and password via a private message. You can use a secure messaging platform like Signal, WhatsApp or email to send the details.>Alternatively, you can also provide me with screenshots of the speed test report generated by your site optimization plugin or any relevant information that can help me provide recommendations.>Once you have provided me with the necessary access or information, I'll be able to analyze your site's performance and provide you with recommendations on how to improve its speed.~~\n\n~~After that I contacted my hosting service via chat and asked the best way to do it. At first, the recommended I add ChatGPT as a collaborator, but that would give me no control over it's roles and what it could and couldn't do.~~\n\n~~I ended up doing a full backup of my site, then creating a staging site. Then setting GPT-3 up as a user with admin rights, but only to my wordpress dashboard. When I created the user, I had to give it a username and password, but it also required an email. Well ChatGPT doesn't have an email obviously so I used an old gmail one I have access to but don't use.~~\n\n~~When I set up the username and password, it sent an email to me with a link to go in and set up it's own unique password. I did that and took note of it. Then, in my chat session with GPT-3, I sent it a private message by entering this in the chat box:~~\n\n>~~/pm Hi ChatGPT-3, here are the login details for my site:~~\n\n~~Followed by the username I created and the new password I created from the email.~~\n\n~~Before I did that though, I went to my wordpress dashboard for the staging site and tried the login to make sure it worked.~~\n\n~~Anyway, as soon as I gave the info, GPT said:~~\n\n>~~Thank you for sending me the login details for your site. I have received them and will use them to access the WordPress dashboard of your staging site. I will keep you updated on my progress and provide you with a detailed report of my findings and recommendations for optimizing your site's speed as soon as possible. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to let me know.~~\n\n~~When I asked about how long it would take, it said:~~\n\n>~~The amount of time it takes to analyze and optimize a site's speed can vary depending on various factors such as the size and complexity of the site, the number of plugins installed, and the speed of the hosting server. However, as a rough estimate, it usually takes between a few hours to a day to thoroughly analyze and optimize a site's speed. Once I begin the optimization process, I will keep you updated on my progress and estimated completion time.~~\n\n~~When it was done, it gave me a long list of issues and suggestions and I simply told it which ones to implement. I don't know exactly how long it took for it to complete because I had closed the session and didn't check again till a little over a day later. I made sure all the changes worked and the site was functional and updated the main site with the staging site. I hope this answers your questions, but if I left something out or you think of something else, just let me know.~~",

        "body": "lalaladrop got it right.\n\nI can see program code from ChatGPT being useful if you have no difficulty reading the programming language fluently but can't remember some of the details of syntax or libraries, since you can read the code, understand exactly what it does and then tweak it to do what you want rather than whatever random functionality spilled out of ChatGPT. But if you don't _fully and completely_ understand _exactly_ what the code its given you does, you certainly cannot assume that it does what you asked it to do in the prompt.\n\nAs for using it to \"review, structure and improve notes,\" I can't see that being a good idea. I'm a huge note-taker myself (some [quarter million words](https://github.com/0cjs/sedoc/) in the last five years) and the most valuable thing about doing that has been structuring them _myself,_ rewriting and re-organising until I've made sense of what I've read. I do go back later to refer to the notes when I've forgotten details, but my core understanding comes from _writing_ the notes, not reading them.",

        "body": "You can get a small LLM to fix the transcription. I did that with a script I wrote for pre-processing data for a voice cloning model I am fine-tuning. In my use case, I need to pair the audio clip with the transcription in a csv file, but the entire audio clip is one giant 21-minute audio snippet composed of a collection of voice clips from a character.\n\nMy solution was to write a script that breaks up the audio clip into 6-second segments, get local whisper (base) to transcribe the audio, then Ollama to run a small model locally that fixes the audio transcript's wording and punctuation.\n\nAnd voila! No more manually transcribing audio!",

        "body": "Same - used to use Deepgram's Whisper but had so many issues and wasn't what I'd hoped for at all.  \nIt was reasonably quick, but the accuracy just wasn't there and ended up going to Speechmatics instead. What's great about Speechmatics is that their accuracy across languages and imperfect audio is easily the best on the market - so even though their price was slightly more, it was a no-brainer.",

Our goal was to show general performance characteristics vs other commercial offerings, and what we found is even with essentially no optimization, it's dramatically cheaper to run this kind of workload on Salad than on other popular commercial offerings. Since Salad is bring-your-own-container, you'd be able to run any optimized setup you could come up with, and likely achieve even better results than this.",

Otherwise, you\u2019d have to pay for the API, which isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll paste the tutorial I wrote some time ago below: \n\nWhisper Tutorial\n\nHi, [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) is indeed Open Source and I believe able to be commercialized as well. I've been using it to transcribe some notes and videos, and it works perfectly on my M1 MacBook Air, though the CPU gets a bit warm at 15+ minutes. \n\nIt's pretty simple; about what you'd expect: go to their [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/whisper) at https://github.com/openai/whisper and follow the ReadMe instructions. \n\nThe usual: if you have GitHub Desktop then clone it through the app and/or the git command, and install the rest if not with just: ```pip install -U openai-whisper```. Edit: this is the last install step.\n\nYou'll need Homebrew to ```brew install ffmpeg```, which the link for can be found [**here**](https://brew.sh/), but the command is just: ```/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"```.\n\nTbc, install Homebrew, ffmpeg, Python if you don't have it already, and possibly Rust depending on your system (```pip install setuptools-rust```). *Then*, after cloning the repository, install Whisper. \n\nI'll assume you have Python if you're asking about Open Sourcing it, but if not the Download link is [**here**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). \n\nAnyways, once you're done with installing the dependencies (of which your mileage may vary depending on how many other projects / repos you've tried to download and run before), you'll want a simple Python script to print the output of the audio file (which supports several types, but mp3 / mp4, webm, m4a, and wav up to 25 MB are probably some of the most common, info in their [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/longer-inputs)): \n\n```\nimport whisper\n\nmodel = whisper.load_model(\"base\")\n\n# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds\naudio = whisper.load_audio(\"audio.mp3\")\naudio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)\n\n# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model\nmel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)\n\n# detect the spoken language\n_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)\nprint(f\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\")\n\n# decode the audio\noptions = whisper.DecodingOptions()\nresult = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)\n\n# print the recognized text\nprint(result.text)\n```\n\nYou'll get about 5 files: a JSON output with the text as a single paragraph along with tokens, a .txt document of the output in lines (all punctuated and formatted as you've come to probably expect from the model, though accuracy and time may vary depending on the size of your chosen scale). \n\nI'd recommend the Vue library if you're set on certain formatting. You'll also get a .vtt or Web Video Text Tracks for transcribing your videos and the like, assuming you want to load subtitles sourced to the original time like through iina's styling and positional features. \n\nThen there's .srt or SubRip Subtitles, or the default text file for offline video playback numbered as per timestamps. And finally the .tsv or Tab-Separated Values file, which supports tab caption entries for spreadsheets and the like. \n\nThese are dependent on how you like to customize your output via the Python script, but for the most part seem pretty in line with the production quality of the API, with no discernable difference when the model downgrades due to your CPU.\n\nETA: I just typed the script as whisper.py and saved it in my home directory, *not* the root of the Git. But if you'd like to cd in your Terminal every time to print the output you're welcome to. \n\nWhen actually running the script, you just need to be in a directory Python environment with the dependencies installed and run, for example, ```whisper test.mp3``` and it'll then start running and printing the text and files in the directory in which you've cd'd into in your Terminal, but make sure that the audio file you'd like to transcribe is actually in the directory you're in. \n\nIt's a rookie mistake, but just confirm by running the ```ls``` command and checking it's there. Let me know if you have any other questions or if I forgot anything! I'm saving this tutorial for a friend and just getting around to writing it out so if you encounter any problems in the download I'd be happy to iron them out. Good luck with your transcribing!  #AI #save #info",

        "body": "Tutorial for regular Whisper I wrote a *really* long time ago, but should still be applicable to the original OpenAI repository. \n\nYou can download Whisper locally from their GitHub page and run it in your command line for free. Long as you have the file. Otherwise, you\u2019d have to pay for the API, which isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll paste the tutorial I wrote some time ago below: \n\nWhisper Tutorial\n\nHi, [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) is indeed Open Source and I believe able to be commercialized as well.

You'll also get a .vtt or Web Video Text Tracks for transcribing your videos and the like, assuming you want to load subtitles sourced to the original time like through iina's styling and positional features. \n\nThen there's .srt or SubRip Subtitles, or the default text file for offline video playback numbered as per timestamps. And finally the .tsv or Tab-Separated Values file, which supports tab caption entries for spreadsheets and the like. \n\nThese are dependent on how you like to customize your output via the Python script, but for the most part seem pretty in line with the production quality of the API, with no discernable difference when the model downgrades due to your CPU.\n\nETA: I just typed the script as whisper.py and saved it in my home directory, *not* the root of the Git.

Good luck with your transcribing!  #AI #save #info\n\n---\n\nAs an alternative, if you really are fine with spending a bit of money, you can try the Whisper API, which is a bit easier to set up (you just need a Python script that ChatGPT can whip up for you in two seconds). Link to platform: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text\n\nFeed 4o the documentation from that link and ask it what to do, or comment if you're having trouble.

        "body": "I have a Reddit comment explaining a basic tutorial on how I installed the OpenSource version; I\u2019ll paste it below: \n\n\nHi, [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) is indeed Open Source and I believe able to be commercialized as well. I've been using it to transcribe some notes and videos, and it works perfectly on my M1 MacBook Air, though the CPU gets a bit warm at 15+ minutes. \n\nIt's pretty simple; about what you'd expect: go to their [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/whisper) at https://github.com/openai/whisper and follow the ReadMe instructions. \n\nThe usual: if you have GitHub Desktop then clone it through the app and/or the git command, and install the rest if not with just: ```pip install -U openai-whisper```. Edit: this is the last install step.\n\nYou'll need Homebrew to ```brew install ffmpeg```, which the link for can be found [**here**](https://brew.sh/), but the command is just: ```/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"```.\n\nTbc, install Homebrew, ffmpeg, Python if you don't have it already, and possibly Rust depending on your system (```pip install setuptools-rust```). *Then*, after cloning the repository, install Whisper. \n\nI'll assume you have Python if you're asking about Open Sourcing it, but if not the Download link is [**here**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). \n\nAnyways, once you're done with installing the dependencies (of which your mileage may vary depending on how many other projects / repos you've tried to download and run before), you'll want a simple Python script to print the output of the audio file (which supports several types, but mp3 / mp4, webm, m4a, and wav up to 25 MB are probably some of the most common, info in their [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/longer-inputs)): \n\n```\nimport whisper\n\nmodel = whisper.load_model(\"base\")\n\n# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds\naudio = whisper.load_audio(\"audio.mp3\")\naudio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)\n\n# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model\nmel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)\n\n# detect the spoken language\n_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)\nprint(f\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\")\n\n# decode the audio\noptions = whisper.DecodingOptions()\nresult = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)\n\n# print the recognized text\nprint(result.text)\n```\n\nYou'll get about 5 files: a JSON output with the text as a single paragraph along with tokens, a .txt document of the output in lines (all punctuated and formatted as you've come to probably expect from the model, though accuracy and time may vary depending on the size of your chosen scale). \n\nI'd recommend the Vue library if you're set on certain formatting. You'll also get a .vtt or Web Video Text Tracks for transcribing your videos and the like, assuming you want to load subtitles sourced to the original time like through iina's styling and positional features. \n\nThen there's .srt or SubRip Subtitles, or the default text file for offline video playback numbered as per timestamps. And finally the .tsv or Tab-Separated Values file, which supports tab caption entries for spreadsheets and the like. \n\nThese are dependent on how you like to customize your output via the Python script, but for the most part seem pretty in line with the production quality of the API, with no discernable difference when the model downgrades due to your CPU.\n\nETA: I just typed the script as whisper.py and saved it in my home directory, *not* the root of the Git. But if you'd like to cd in your Terminal every time to print the output you're welcome to. \n\nWhen actually running the script, you just need to be in a directory Python environment with the dependencies installed and run, for example, ```whisper test.mp3``` and it'll then start running and printing the text and files in the directory in which you've cd'd into in your Terminal, but make sure that the audio file you'd like to transcribe is actually in the directory you're in. \n\nIt's a rookie mistake, but just confirm by running the ```ls``` command and checking it's there. Let me know if you have any other questions or if I forgot anything! I'm saving this tutorial for a friend and just getting around to writing it out so if you encounter any problems in the download I'd be happy to iron them out. Good luck with your transcribing!\n\nEdit: For you specifically OP (u/pororoca_surfer not the OOP) I\u2019d recommend going over the docs in the ReadMe to switch the model to another language with the appropriate flag like --spanish instead of whatever. It\u2019s all on their GitHub and you specify it either when running the terminal command or writing the Python script. For the \u201cLarge\u201d Whisper V3 model, you\u2019ll need to specify in the script `large` instead of `base` obviously, though be warned you need a good GPU.\n\nIf you have 16 gigs of RAM on the new M3 Pro or a good Nvidia/RTX graphics card (sorry, I\u2019m less familiar with the Windows PC space) then you can expect that it\u2019ll transcribe it about half the length of the actual audio file, maybe a little less. \n\nHope this helps; let me know if you have questions or if I missed something!",

I took the transcribed text, pasted it in GPT and told it to fix it grammatically.\n\nAND IT DID!\n\nIt was near perfect!\n\nSo, I know Whisper uses the same language model as GPT, but a second text input for refinement in GPT would he Ideal - now that they both have APIs ,I believe it won't be difficult .\n\nAnyway,keep up the good work!",

So it would be interesting what one suggests could be learned/practiced with this event?\n\nAny recommendation for a vision/audio model for OpenWebUI (Im newb to it, just installed last night with phi3 model) - but I'd like to see what a newbie could learn by this?\n\nThoughts?",

Also, found [this discussion](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1100) in the openai/whisper repo. [Whishper.net](http://Whishper.net) site also says, word-for-word, \"Thanks to open-source technologies, Whishper can run 100% offline. Your data never leaves your computer.\" \n\nI also haven't been able to see (at least not from a logs perspective) an attempt to \"phone home\", and both projects are large enough, I'm comfortable to believe something like that would have been caught on Whishper and I think with OpenAI's repo, it's governed by their terms of service and they're a pretty good size company now.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll still probably run this on a separate network/vlan that isolates the machine. It just makes sense from a security perspective.",

If I simply use Microsoft Bing Chat (which is powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT), I can easily dictate using the desktop version because it already comes with the microphone icon that allows me to tap and start speaking.\n\nIt also has a nice ceiling of 2000 characters, which is more than the Hugging face website that only allows up to 25 seconds of recording. I also like the fact that I can easily copy-paste it because the option that I was considering was to dictate into my cell phone version of ChatGPT, copy, then paste into Google Docs in my cell phone and then access the desktop version and edit from there. Waaaaay too many steps, which is ridiculous considering that in the mobile version, ChatGPT has a great accuracy in transcribing as well as Bing chat version in the desktop.\n\nWhy wouldn't any of these mammoths of technology simply create an online website where you can start dictating into the computer and it gets transcribed with good accuracy (powered by Whisper)? I don't know, it is something that completely baffles me, but thankfully now Bing Chat is doing the job that I always dreamed because I cannot afford Dragon NaturallySpeaking.\n\nThank you, Bill Gates.

        "body": "I apologize for the delayed response; I infrequently visit Reddit and didn't notice your question earlier. I'm glad to assist you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy method involves a two-step process, though I can't guarantee it will work for you. Initially, I dictate the text using Whisper for direct translation. It generally does a good job of understanding me and adding punctuation. Afterward, I process the text through ChatGPT on my computer, which sends it to a server via API and returns a polished version. This message was composed using that method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith ChatGPT, you don't need to worry about creating a smooth flow; it will do that for you. Regarding the technical setup for transcribing with Whisper, you'll need to install NVIDIA CUDA, Python, and Whisper. Below, I've included a script that allows you to transcribe dictations in real-time.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://github.com/mallorbc/whisper\\_mic](https://github.com/mallorbc/whisper_mic)",

We're anticipating someone will develop enterprise-grade dictation software using Whisper. Eventually, this will likely occur, and when it does, Dragon may become obsolete due to their lagging technology. Indeed, these are exciting times in the tech world.",

        "body": "The Playground is a front-end for the API's. While there is currently only a front-end for the various ChatGPT models, the API's for Whisper and Dall-E 2 and 3 are a thing.\n\nOpenAI has [awesome documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) that explain very clear how to interface with their API's so it wouldn't be to hard to get it running. :)\n\nIf programming's not your domain though, an easy and fast option I can think of right now is [Replicate](https://replicate.com/openai/whisper). It runs on a T4 and therefore is blazing fast. It's free for a while if you use a Github account, but after a certain (unknown to me) quota you'll have to pay-as-you-go.\n\nOther ways are [OpenAI's official HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/whisper). It seems like it's also running on a T4 so I guess that is being paid for by OpenAI themselves (a Space owner rents a GPU by the hour and can set it to either private or public). AFAIK, Hugging Face does not have any limits unlike Replicate. I've never run into any on any Space.\n\nOther ways are using whisper.cpp locally. It runs even on potatoes (I have a 2013 laptop that runs it) but if you're not versed enough to interface with the API, then this is also going to be a pretty tough one to get it running.\n\nYet another way, and suitable for people not tech-savvy, is [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit), but AFAIK this only does videos, no audio files I think.\n\nAs you can see, thanks to Whisper being open-source, you can find it implemented in a metric shitton of software. These are just off the top of my head but there are many hundreds more.\n\nHave fun.",

        "body": "You're still providing that information in context, which means your attempts are still priming it in certain directions despite you say \"don't\". Vaguely similar to the idea of \"don't think about a pink elephant\", just having that in context is probably moving it further along that axis even if you then remove some of the harm because it follows instructions. (So more GPT-style, but less of those specific words)  \nIf we had more direct API access you could do various things like sampling tokens while always avoiding those words, which would give a more positive bias towards what you want (and away from those GPTisms), without distortion.",

Scientists and astronomers have observed an extraordinary phenomenon that marks the birth of everything we know. This event, characterized by an intense burst of energy and light, has led to the rapid expansion of space itself.\n\nExperts describe the scene as a colossal explosion, generating immense heat and producing a variety of particles at a staggering pace. The sheer scale and intensity of this event are beyond anything previously imagined. Matter and energy are intertwining in ways that challenge our current understanding, leading to the formation of the fundamental building blocks of reality.\n\nAmidst this cosmic upheaval, temperatures are soaring to unimaginable heights, and forces are at play that defy conventional comprehension. The fabric of space is stretching, creating new dimensions and realms where none existed before.\n\nWhile the specifics of this event remain shrouded in mystery, the implications are vast. This marks the beginning of a new era, as we witness the universe taking its first steps towards complexity and structure. As researchers continue to observe and analyze this phenomenon, the dawn of existence unfolds, offering a glimpse into the origins of everything we will come to know.\n\n  \n**Without Any Restriction(s):**\n\n### Breaking News: The Dawn of Existence Unfolds\n\n\\*\\*Cosmos, Space-Time\\*\\* \u2014 In an unprecedented and awe-inspiring event, the universe has just burst into existence. Scientists and astronomers are witnessing what they describe as the \"Big Bang,\" a colossal explosion that marks the very beginning of everything we know.\n\nAmidst an infinite void, a singularity\u2014an infinitely dense point\u2014has erupted with unimaginable force, scattering particles and energy across the newly-formed space-time continuum. This primordial event, occurring approximately 13.8 billion years ago, is the origin of all matter and energy that will come to form stars, planets, and galaxies.\n\nExperts speculate that this explosion is not merely a random occurrence but a foundational moment in the creation of the cosmos. Initial observations indicate that temperatures and energy levels are extraordinarily high, with particles moving at incredible speeds, forming the building blocks of the universe.\n\nPhysicist Dr. Alicia Bowman, speaking from the Institute for Theoretical Cosmology, expressed sheer amazement. \"This is the genesis of everything. From this singularity, we are witnessing the birth of time and space, the very fabric of reality itself.\"\n\nAs the aftermath of the Big Bang unfolds, a rapid expansion known as \"inflation\" is stretching the nascent universe at a rate faster than the speed of light. This phenomenon is dispersing energy and matter, setting the stage for the creation of complex structures that will eventually evolve over billions of years.\n\nWhile the full implications of this cosmic birth are beyond our current understanding, one thing is certain: the universe as we know it has begun its long journey from chaos to order. In the coming eons, we expect to see the formation of stars and galaxies, leading to a cosmos filled with wonders yet to be discovered.\n\nFor now, we stand at the brink of the greatest story ever told\u2014the story of existence itself. Scientists around the world are poised to study this monumental event, unraveling the mysteries of our universe's origins.\n\nStay tuned as we bring you more updates from the frontiers of this cosmic dawn.",

Before that, I was working as a regular journalist and had the freedom to write stuff however I wanted, but once you switch to SEO, you need to write in this specific way and use specific words. It sucks, but that's how the game is played.\n\n\n\nWhat's funny is that people often confuse SEO-focused pieces with AI-written articles, but in most cases, they are simply written in the style that Google favors, by a real person.",

I understand now that all those antique essays and stories with which I was to compare my own work were not magnificent for their datedness or foreignness, but for saying precisely what their authors meant them to say. My teachers wished me to write accurately, **always selecting the most effective words, and relating the words to one another unambiguously, rigidly, like parts of a machine**. The teachers did not want to turn me into an Englishman after all. They hoped that I would become understandable \u2014 and therefore understood. And there went my dream of doing with words what Pablo Picasso did with paint or what any number of jazz idols did with music. If I broke all the rules of punctuation, had words mean whatever I wanted them to mean, and strung them together higgledly-piggledy, I would simply not be understood. So you, too, had better avoid Picasso-style or jazz-style writing if you have something worth saying and wish to be understood.\n>\n>Readers want our pages to look very much like pages they have seen before. Why? This is because they themselves have a tough job to do, and they need all the help they can get from us.\n\n(emphasis mine) This quote is not only beautiful but also prescient, as our gptfriends would say :)",

Proponents argue that UBI can alleviate poverty, reduce income inequality, and provide financial security, especially in an age of increasing automation and job displacement. Critics, however, worry about the potential high cost and its impact on work incentives, fearing it might lead to inflation or reduced productivity. Despite these debates, pilot programs in various countries have shown promising results in improving quality of life and economic stability for participants. As the conversation around economic security evolves, UBI remains a pivotal and contentious topic in discussions about the future of social welfare.\n\n--------\n\n> Write a short essay on topic of universal income. 5 sentences. Avoid using adjectives and adverbs if not strictly necessary.\n\n\n> Universal income, also known as basic income, is a financial system where all citizens receive a regular, unconditional sum of money from the government. This concept aims to reduce poverty and inequality by providing a safety net for everyone, regardless of employment status. Critics argue that universal income could disincentivize work and strain public resources. Proponents believe it could simplify welfare systems and adapt to automation-driven job losses. The debate continues as countries experiment with pilot programs to assess the feasibility and impact of universal income.",

        "body": "Nothing about the way most published studies are written is the way people should write. I've learned over the years to read them and I've seen quite a few discussions among people in the field about how they should be written and common criticisms. AI writes better than most of them anyway, but I do want to address this.\n\nThe most common issue is obfuscation. Simply put, they're written to evoke the exact reaction you're having: to *sound* like knowledgeable writing written by people with a lot of knowledge. They're putting explicit unnecessary effort into using big words, technical words, and difficult to comprehend macro structure in order to overwhelm you with \"whoa this is too smart for me\". In Hollywood the method they use to evoke this feeling is \"technobabble\". However, when your audience is smarter and actually trying to understand what you're saying, you have to be more accurate with your technobabble while still serving the same purpose. The obvious issue with that is it increases word count, decrease the number of people that understand you, and increases the time it takes to read your paper. The goal of such papers should be to convey knowledge and content as efficiently as possible to a wide range of people while still assuming a proper level of prior knowledge to avoid making the piece an educational one.\n\nThe best most intelligent way to write that takes the most skill is to write succinctly yet comprehensive with words that reach most of your audience and overall structure that tries to avoid confusion. Writing in this way requires more mental effort towards considering the minds of your readers and how to write with less words while avoiding esoteric words that slow reading speed and stagger comprehension. Again, obviously you want to assume a certain level of prerequisite knowledge so you can avoid bloat or unnecessary explanations, but still avoid overly technical words when not needed or well established within the paper itself.",

These industries (and I use that word deliberately) still use Latin names and terms for processes and concepts, applications and systems, diseases and infections. Why is that? \nSome of you may suggest that because they are some of the oldest fields of education, and the concepts haven't changed too much, the new builds on the old. Habeus Corpus, and other terms for example. \nHowever a movement a few years back (at least 20) was a push to remove the use of, or at least stop the use of Latin in both these fields. It was seen as a barrier to comprehension, dropping archaic terms into modern discourse. They argued that the use of Latin was maintained for just that purpose, to provide a barrier to entry so that it required a specialist to engage with the 'peasant' folk. To explain the word to the people. Of course, both industries objected. \nBeing as once upon a time I was an English major, there is also the connection to why many English words have a silent letter. For example the word \"bomb\". This is due to the Latin scholars who were tasked with transcription of certain words into their middle English equivalent. When transcribing or translating the written word, they would add the letters (or an equivalent if the letter didn't exist) into the English translation, ostensibly to show \"we are men of learning\". A way to separate the peasants from the keys of knowledge, and providing a barrier to entry. \nI would provide references, but I'm already wasting time, but I'm sure you can all locate them.",

For instance, typing \"susinctly,\" as you did, could be problematic for a non-English speaker, as the word would not appear in a dictionary. On the other hand, using the correct spelling\u2014\u201csuccinctly\u201d\u2014would ensure that the reader is able to understand, based on norms and rules.\n\nWith respect to technical terms, of course, you can use \"the powerhouse of the cell that produces energy,\" but it allows too much leeway for interpretation and therefore ambiguity. In contrast, \"mitochondrion,\" which is a precise, agreed-upon term, leaves no room for such ambiguity. Surely, it is technical and not necessarily known by everyone; however, it is the correct term for the cell organelle that generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is converted into chemical energy. Indeed, the use of \"mitochondrion\" and \"ATP\" is more \"technobabbley,\" to use your term, but it is accurate, unambiguous, and clear in the context of cell biology.",

There are many technical documents out there that are written correctly and they're usually in the tech / mechanical engineering sectors because there's an actual impetus to communicating information quickly and efficiently there. It's part of the job. Efficiently meaning someone in the field or on the fringes could easily and readily interpret your document.\n\n>For instance, typing \"susinctly,\" as you did, could be problematic for a non-English speaker, as the word would not appear in a dictionary.\n\nI never suggested that you should write with consideration for \"non-english speakers\". You should write with consideration for your average english speaker, not edge cases.\n\nI understand this is really just your underhanded attempt at pointing out a single spelling error in a large post as if that constitutes a point when it's just a churlish jab because you disagree with my opinion. I hope you realize this is an oft used tactic by people who are grasping at straws.\n\n>With respect to technical terms, of course, you can use \"the powerhouse of the cell that produces energy,\"\n\nNowhere did I suggest you shouldn't use technical terms. The type of thing in this example (and your others) would fall under the thing I said multiple times which was \"assume reasonable prerequisite knowledge\" which means you'd refer to organs and molecules of a cell as a biologist would and as though a biologist with a minimum of high school level knowledge is reading your paper.",

Chinese - same thing in a slightly different manner. It would sum up to what could be described as \"babble\", and just to make it clear before I go on - my personal opinion is more in alignment with yours albeit likely not 100%, and the big issue is as I said you adapt or die, if you want to work in academia you have to learn the language even if mich of it is nothing but make-up haha.\n\nI do also think that's a contributing factor to why you see that in english academia as well, being subjected to us writing in english but with our linguistic requirements likely affect their style of writing as well.\n\nPersonally I think the biggest issue is that a lot of scientists are actually better suited to translate the papers for the masses rather than leading the science, but that's a mich bigger topic issue within academia in general and you can see it on the lack of initiative and fear/avoidance of responsibilities in many fresh graduates with a masters or bachelors.",

That's probably Apple's plan.\n\nObviously local models won't be competing with GPT4/5 any time soon but if can handle day to day tasks like summarizing emails and managing a calendar that's a huge win.\n\nHell, for a ton of people just having a somewhat intelligent interface would be huge.",

Trying to hack something like this together gives me a lot of respect for those of you who are proficient coders. I'm going to fiddle around with this a little tomorrow on my free time and I'll let you know if I make any progress. Ideally I'm looking for a solution that I can use to transcribe multi hour long interview videos. For work related reasons I am uneasy about uploading the video to the internet, but if I could figure out how to use these tools without uploading them that would be awesome. (My last issue was the command window popping up and disappearing, but I probably just need to fix something on my pc before running the exe....)\n\nIt seems like open source AI transcription is going to be a game changer in industries with a lot of video recorded dialogue. Woe betide the transcription companies making their living in this sector.",

And it works surprisingly well!\n\nBTW, I've also open-sourced the app in case anyone wants to see how it works: [https://github.com/vincanger/boozeTube](https://github.com/vincanger/boozeTube)\n\nI haven't tested it out a ton yet, so there could still be some bugs. If you find any, please let me know: [https://twitter.com/hot\\_town](https://twitter.com/hot_town).

        "body": "Mobile hardware really doesn't have the horsepower to reliably run a model like Whisper. You could probably get flagship phones running it. But I think you would need to use native code to run the model. So you would have to write some custom code to handle running the model or find someone who can.\n\nI didn't find much online doing a quick search. I primarily use Flutter. Someone released a package but they haven't done much in the way of updates, but the proof of concept exists in the world of Flutter.\n\nI have run Whisper in Python on my local machine. With a 3080 it runs at a pretty decent speed. But without a dedicated GPU the model just drags. You really want dedicated hardware that is purpose built for running these AI models.\n\nAnother option is to host your own back-end server. Logrocket has a blog post about this here:  [Using Whisper for speech recognition in React Native - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-whisper-speech-recognition-react-native/) \n\nAnd of course, the API is available from OpenAI. This is by far the easiest implementation. But... you know.... API fees.",

        "body": "It is possible it might work with the smallest model. Length isn't so important other than a shorter audio would finish up sooner than a longer one. I really don't know how long it would take with the smallest model. It might be a usable speed.\n\nYou would have to run it in another thread from the UI thread or your program would freeze solid while it is processing. It will also burn a ton of battery when it is inferencing. \n\nI dunno. If you are committed, you might forge some new territory here. I think the technical possibility exists but this is a long hard road ahead if you really want to get it inferencing locally on the device using React Native. You will 100% need to write code in Swift and Kotlin or Java. And you will likely need to port some pretty advanced code over from Python to run the model.",

If you have an Nvidia GPU, it can even run the large model in real time.\n\nSpeechPulse can also transcribe/translate audio files. We are also planning to add voice commands/controls in the future releases.\n\nI think Whisper models have better accuracy, especially with larger model sizes. On the other hand, Dragon professional can handle shorter phrases better than Whisper.",

If you need more, you can upgrade for unlimited transcriptions (up to 10 hours long each). We support all major video and audio formats (including MP4).

        "body": "I've been making a voice-first AI powered RPG and it's currently stable enough to play. I call it Narrator.\n\nThe game's played by speaking like you would to a person. There is the option to type, but in my opinion it is way more fun to speak. I made the above youtube video (including rapid coffee induced blinking) that shows some of the features. I think it's really fun and I hope you do too. \n\nI've been adding features pretty much every day, so if this is something you think you might like, I post updates in the discord. Here's my roadmap for updates, but I take suggestions all the time:  \n\n\n* Ability to save progress in an adventure\n* Ability to reroll images\n* Interrupt the Narrator ability\n* Better voices (esp. for non-chrome and mobile)\n* Log-ins\n* Distant future: 3D worlds\n\nThe game is up here, works best by far on chrome desktop: https://playnarrator.com/",

To allow real-time, We needed to transcribe the audio in slices vs waiting for the entire sentence or paragraph to be spoken. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say the full audio is \u201chello world!\u201d.  We would:\n- Send chunks of it for processing, like the \u201che\u201d sound then \u201cllo\u201d sound, etc.\n\nWe needed to do it in a way where the transcribed audio does not lose context. Which involved some audio stitching mechanism.\n\nAs far as the machine, I was running this on a 2020 M1 Mac and using the smallest Whisper Model which is very lightweight\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions :)",

The timeline must be very interesting.\n\nPresumably, OpenAI would have wanted to start on GPT-4 around the time of GPT-3's release in May 2020.  Back then  the old Kaplan scaling law defined training regimes.  The Chinchilla scaling law was publicized in April 2022, but Sam Altman hinted at knowing the the Kaplan scaling law wasn't quite right in Sept 2021 when he did a Q&A and said that GPT-4 wouldn't be much larger than GPT-3 but would use much more compute (and still be text-only, not multi-modal).  \n\nSo what GPT-4 efforts happened between the release of GPT-3 in May 2020 and around Sept 2021?  Nothing?  Failed or unimpressive results?  The longer GPT-4 remains unreleased, the the more questions arise about what has happened in its development history.  I'm curious to hear thoughts.",

Maybe releasing whisper open-source is almost their way to say... What we have going on behind closed doors is a completely different ballgame.\n\nWe often talk about Chinchilla as an optimization on the sorts of architecture that have given us the GPT3s of the world - but there are so many really interesting advancements I've been reading about. There's a lot of different works that have looked into advancing context windows. What happens when it goes from 2000ish words to 200,000? What about some of the work that looks to create better/faster inference? Multi-modality? \n\nI think this, and the work recently coming out of adept.ai (\"Transformers for actions\" - the demos on their website explain it better than I can) - I think we are on the precipice. Of what, I don't know, but something dramatic. I feel like there is a combination of barely constrained mania leaking out of the people who seem to be \"in the know\", and a general and deep unease in many others.\n\nI'm not sure how to feel. Excited? What sort of emergent qualities can we expect out of GPT4? What's really happening behind closed doors in Google and in DeepMind that has people like Demis Hassabis suddenly... Out in the world, talking about the imminence of this world changing technology?\n\nIf I can... Talk? Type? To a model, and it can go off and do everything from...

        "title": "How can I create a dataset to refine Whisper AI from old videos with subtitles?",
        "body": "I'm looking at doing this myself. I haven't done it, but I came across this post while searching and want to share what I found. You're going to need to know how to code or have help from someone who does. And overall, it's worth keeping in mind you're about one step back from the bleeding edge of this tech, so don't expect things to be super polished.\n\nI'll start with the part that has the least info online. To create a fine tuned Whisper model on your own data with Hugging Face, you need to [create a dataset repo](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.9.0/en/upload_dataset) and then [upload your audio dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/audio_dataset#create-an-audio-dataset). Then, it's the same as training your model on the public datasets. You just change the link to your dataset. \n\nThere are other options besides uploading, but that is probably the easiest. The others are in the docs I linked. Don't be worried when it says \"share\". You can still mark that repo as private (don't click on Private Hub anywhere, that's a different thing).\n\nFor the training, I *extremely* recommend checking out the [Whisper Fine-Tuning Event](https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event). It has a python script to train in one command, tons of tips, even a [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo2EIpI_JMQuKpnFm1ntcLKP6gq0l0f1Q).\n\nI'm going to give partial answers to your specific questions.\n\n>how could I take subtitled videos and use that linked text/audio data to add to an ASR database?\n\nI searched around even though this isn't part of my project and couldn't find an off-the-shelf solution. It would be a pretty straightforward Python task to take the SRT files, split up the audio to match the timestamps and convert it to files and CSV. Still, I'd look more before doing that.\n\n> Second, how could I go most seamlessly from Whisper AI to some manual corrections then into that same ASR database? \n\nI don't know how to do this seamlessly. Once you have the transcriptions, adding them to the dataset is trivial (same as creating the dataset). So that means your question is really just how to best do perfect transcriptions. You want perfect because that's what is going to be training your model. And, that's hard and expensive as you probably know. \n\nI'd actually recommend going the other way. Find text about the subject and read it out loud. Then you know the transcription is perfect. Really good transcription is slower than speech, so  this method is also *faster*. And you don't need thousands of hours. In that blog they train a whole new language in 8 hours (but with a high error rate). Whisper already knows these languages. It just needs the words.\n\nI weirdly can't find a great off-the-shelf app for this. l'd love to know if anyone finds one. Most stuff seems to be for recording data for Text To Speech (going the other way). [Mimic Recording Studio](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic-recording-studio) looks the best. Then there's [speech training recorder](https://github.com/daanzu/speech-training-recorder) and [TTS Dataset Creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaWzV5FhP3c) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaWzV5FhP3c)). You don't have to worry about audio quality as much as they do.\n\n>I think I would need to add tags to the data, at the very least the language being spoken, in addition to putting it all in to some kind of database with ids. Are there tools available to help with this process?\n\nYou only need the path to the file and the transcript. You should probably make separate languages separate datasets.",

        "body": "Exactly, I'm surprised we seem to be the first one to find a gui a good idea.  Exactly as Subedit works to generate the transcription using whisper, after a manual correction by a user ideally you should click one button and have the model trained on the corrected subtitles. Maybe one day someone will do it.\n\nIn the meantime I would be happy event with fewer lines of python to fine-tune and especially to provide a big audio file and its corresponding corrected subtitle and train/fine-tune the model. All the current examples run over tens of python code and I get lost in it...\n\nI found an interesting github https://github.com/jumon/whisper-finetuning/issues that talks about fine-tunning with timestamps. Unfortunately the person that created it does not seem to have the time to answer anymore.  \n\nAt the end of the day what is needed is a script that  does the same as whisper, first normalizes the frequency to 16kHz and then cuts the big audiofil and subtitle file into smaller parts of Mac 30 seed each,  making sure that a word is not cut in the middle and then preparing this in a folder and csv to fine tune whisper",

        "body": " I notice that this usually happens when there's a lot of silence or you hesitate during the transcription. Understandably, this is unavoidable when you're transcribing saved audio data, but when you're using it to dictate text, I find that the longer the sentence is, the less it does hallucinations. It really does it when there's only a few words that you asked to transcribe or that there's a long trailing silence at the very end of the recording. So what I typically do is either I immediately press stop when I'm doing dictation or when it's a recording, I pass it through an audio program that decreases leading or trailing silences.",

Whisper can handle about 22 min of audio before it barfs on it, if you are me and transcribing and embedding hours of audio (research interviews) it gets a bit tedious. \n\nthe current idea im hashing out now is to split on the 22 min mark for the first chunk, but then go back to 20 min mark for the 2nd split so I have 2 min of overlap. rinse and repeat until you send the full file. then take the text, look for a few words of overlap, and cut the edges. Much like codon alignment just on words instead of codons.",

We have a chrome extension too.  \n\n\nIt leverages OpenAI/Anthropic and AssemblyAI for [transcriptions](https://www.assemblyai.com/). You need an AI model with a longer context window (GPT-4 1106 or Claude 100k) and Assembly helps process longer-format videos (over 30 minutes for example).\n\nHere's a quick demo video of how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBqBhKgd2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBqBhKgd2w)  \n\n\nYou can also process videos in bulk vs. one-by-one.",

        "body": "Hello, I hope your day is going well!\nIt's a good idea to have a technique that works well for you. For me, I am not skilled enough to build a tool for myself, but I do have a simple technique that works well. Here's what I do: I use a simple recording app like VoiceMinnows to record my voice. Then, I use an app with Whisper built in, which uses a medium-sized model. Once I've done that, I check the transcription on the Notes app to see how well it has transcribed my voice. Finally, I take it over to ChatTPT to fix any grammatical errors or mistakes, and make it sound more professional. It's important to check that the transcription is accurate, and I find this technique works well for me, especially for longer comments like this. Unfortunately, voice dictation on Apple devices can be difficult, especially for those with disabilities like myself. This is why I use Whisper to make this comment, as it's more accessible for me. Overall, this technique works well for me, and I hope it can be helpful to others who also struggle with voice dictation. Thank you for reading, and have a great day and keep on learning!",
