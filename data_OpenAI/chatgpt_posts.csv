2024-12-13 15:14:32,josunne2409,OpenAI,Don't pay for ChatGPT Pro instead use gemini-exp-1206,"For all who use Chatgpt for coding, please do not pay ChatGPT Pro, Google has released the gemini-exp-1206 model, https://aistudio.google.com/, which for me is better than o1 (o1-preview was the best for me but it's gone). I pay for GPT Plus, I have the Advanced Voice model with Camera, I have the o1 model 50 week messages, which together with gemini-exp-1206 is enough.


Edit: I found that gemini-exp-1206 with temperature 0 gives better responses for code",1154,242,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1hded7u/dont_pay_for_chatgpt_pro_instead_use_geminiexp1206/,1hded7u

2024-06-24 07:02:41,surfer808,OpenAI,I‚Äôm sick of waiting for chatGPT 4o Voice and I lost a lot of respect for OpenAi,"I‚Äôve been religiously checking for the voice update multiple times a day considering they said it would be out ‚Äúin a few weeks‚Äù. I realize OpenAi just put that demo out there to stick it to Google‚Äôs Ai demo which was scheduled for the next day. What a horrible thing to do to people.

I‚Äôm sure so many people signed up hoping they would get this feature and it‚Äôs no where in sight. 

Meanwhile, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is doing a great job and I‚Äôm happy with it. ",561,368,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1dn7dwq/im_sick_of_waiting_for_chatgpt_4o_voice_and_i/,1dn7dwq
