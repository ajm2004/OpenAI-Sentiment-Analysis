1d1hkbk,,Struggling with justifying ChatGPT Plus,"Hello, I've recently bought ChatGPT Plus because I wanted to try the ""GPT Logo generator"" thing, and I tried it, it was... decent, but I started getting into the whole memory mechanic, and kind of realized that I can construct my own little personalized chatbot that knows me personally.

And, I kind of like the subscription, but, I am also living paycheck-to-paycheck, and it's expensive, $20 a month, when you're broke, that's not just money you can throw away. I'm struggling to justify the purchase of ChatGPT, Originally, I would develop web apps that make functionality with the API, which worked, but was labor intensive. 

But, now with ChatGPT Plus, I can do these by just making my own ""GPT"" which is far less labor intensive, and there are many productive tools that also exist for the chatgpt plus subscribers... including other tools that try to get you to pay money for their service to work with ChatGPT.

So, there's benefits, but downsides, and quite frankly, I want to keep it, but I have to cut something else, I was thinking cut Github copilot since ChatGPT is able to accomplish the same task, but at the same time, It's still $20, - 10 for copilot, I am still in a $10 loss, does ChatGPT justify 10$ extra?

So, I wanted to ask here, is there anything else ChatGPT can do that adds value, or is there anything that you think makes it more valuable to what you do? I'd love to hear discussions about the matter, thank you for reading.

  
**TL;DR:** I bought ChatGPT Plus for the ""GPT Logo generator"" and discovered the memory feature, making personalized chatbots easier. I like it but struggle with the $20/month cost, especially since I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck. Considering canceling GitHub Copilot to save money, but I'm still $10 short.

1doy6zd,,Is the Voice Chat in ChatGPT Plus Worth It? ,"
Hi everyone ,

I’m currently using the free version of ChatGPT, and I’m considering upgrading to the paid subscription. My main interest is in using the voice chat feature to communicate with ChatGPT.

I’d like to know if the voice chat in the paid version offers more nuanced and in-depth responses across different topics compared to the free version. Specifically, I’m interested in discussing history and philosophy. For instance, if I want to have a detailed conversation about these subjects, does the paid version provide more depth, nuance, and specificity in its responses?

Your experiences and insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

EDIT : I know the voice chat is just text converted to audio, my question still stands, is the paid version has more depth and nuances in conversations related to philosophy and history ",OpenAI,0,8,2024-06-26 13:07:47,furlong0
19cyqr0,,Can I replace this ChatGPT Plus features if I use only the APIs?,"Greetings,

I don't use ChatGPT so often, so I'm evaluating to cancel the subscription and go with the APIs (read: pay as you go).

I have found many little Apps that can replace some features with the APIs, but I really need this ones:

\- GPT4, the latter model the better because I need context for my research and longform articles

\- Generating images (Dall-E?)

Optional but I'd like to:

\- text to speech

\- analyzing images, such as screenshots of tables and statistics. No need of PDFs because I've found a replacement for this

So...can I keep these features if I cancel my ChatGPT Plus subscription?

1bpw8fg,,ChatGPT Plus subscription could add the possibility of training all of your previous conversations,"
It is good that each new conversation with GPT is contained, so you don't get biased answers from other topics.

However, the more you use it, the harder it becomes to retrieve information you generated with GPT from months ago. I think I have thousands of messages now, and sometimes I need some info that I know I got from GPT before.

If we had a personal GPT, one instance that knows about all of your previous conversations, it could be much easier to manage the information you generated.",OpenAI,17,9,2024-03-28 13:56:38,backwards_watch

As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something  specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get  better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements  over time. For example: 

* You’ve explained that you prefer  meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at  the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way.
* You’ve  told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming  messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows  where to start. 
* You mention that you have a toddler and that  she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday  card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. 
* As a  kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with  follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create  lesson plans.

How do you guys think it is implemented? I would imagine it does something like:

\- Recognizes certain prompts as ""memory instructions"" and decides to keep these as ""long term memories""

\- Uses Vectorized embeddings to store chunks of memory instructions into ""long term memories"".  
\- Keeps these ""memory"" instructions within the short-term context window by periodically re-inserting the instruction into the conversation when the context window length would be exceeded (i.e. when the model is close to ""forgetting"").

I am implementing an openai wrapper (with function calling support) and I currently use truncation / summarization to manage the context window. I am curious about integrating a pseudo-long term memory feature into my own code + periodically re-insert these ""memory instructions"" into recent conversation context, but as I only use Chat Completion streams, I would need a total refactor if embeddings were at play (and I also have heard that OpenAI embedding can be very expensive compared to local LLM embeddings which I also play around with).

1h8k44p,,Is OpenAI’s New $200/Month “Pro” Subscription Really Worth It?,"Just saw the announcement for OpenAI’s new “Pro” plan at a whopping $200 a month. Supposedly, this gives you unlimited access to their new o1-feature, which is basically a fancy method of internally refining responses through multiple iterations until it reaches four separate outputs considered “correct.” But here’s the catch: this process can take up to ten minutes. That’s right - ten minutes for what boils down to something I could replicate with a bit of clever prompting myself.

They’ve also removed all the usual limitations, including that much-hyped Advanced Voice Mode, which was previously capped under the regular Plus subscription. The normal Plus plan already includes these features, just with usage caps like daily message limits, a 45-minute voice mode cap, and shorter “reasoning time” for the o1 feature. Now, for $200 a month, you supposedly can do it all limitlessly. **But seriously, is that worth the price hike?**

Honestly, you can pull off the same reflection-based improvements using the API for far less. The research behind this “reflection” technique has been public for ages. In fact, you can do something as simple as asking, “Why was the last response incorrect?” and get a refined answer without shelling out an extra $200. If you’re working in any specialized domain, you’re better off implementing your own reflection system - or even juggling two Plus accounts or a team plan for a fraction of the cost. The so-called unlimited Advanced Voice Mode doesn’t justify that price tag either. It’s glitchy, tends to interrupt you, and you often have to start over from scratch. It’s not even supported in GPTs, and there’s no web search yet. Come on, if I’m paying $200 a month, I’d expect a rock-solid experience.

The entire direction OpenAI is taking feels off. They keep stacking on new features - some half-baked, others outright buggy - just to appear like they’re on the cutting edge, but it’s starting to feel like an overstuffed mess. Every new update chips away at reliability. They flaunt GPTs with large character limits (up to 8,000), but stability nosedives around 4,000 characters. By 8,000, the model is basically forgetting basic instructions you’ve hammered into it repeatedly. It’s like they’re trying to wring every last drop out of their existing architecture, and we’re the guinea pigs stuck with the fallout.

Instead of rushing out these undercooked features, OpenAI should focus on transparency and quality. Show us where GPT-5 is at. Offer real demos and progress updates. Fix your bugs. Strengthen your support systems. As someone who’s spent years professionally testing software, I know how to report bugs properly - yet reporting issues to OpenAI’s support is like shouting into the void. They don’t listen, and when they do, they can’t even distinguish between model and API issues. They’ve brushed me off, ignored legitimate bug reports, and even botched a bug bounty. It’s a joke.

Don’t get me wrong: I love ChatGPT. It’s an incredible product. But as long as OpenAI continues to milk it for every cent without ensuring quality, stability, and proper support, the entire experience will degrade. For $200 a month, I’d expect revolutionary improvements, not a messy bundle of half-working features that I can replicate myself more cheaply and reliably. OpenAI, if you’re reading this: slow down, clean up your act, and remember why people fell in love with ChatGPT in the first place.",OpenAI,33,113,2024-12-07 04:01:15,martin_rj

13amp5c,,"Once AI with no content filter comes in, chat GPT and open AI will die out.","The most significant complaint I have encountered thus far concerns the restrictions imposed by ChatGPT and other AI systems, such as Stable Diffusion. Many individuals, myself included, are reluctant to pay for a limited AI. Google has openly acknowledged that this is one of the reasons they may not win the AI race and that they need to learn from those outside the company. Several of my friends purchased ChatGPT-4 and later canceled their subscriptions due to disappointment. Additionally, not every GPT-4 user has access to certain plugins and features, despite being subscribed to GPT Plus, having submitted access requests, and waiting for months.

I would personally be willing to pay up to $40 per month or more for an AI without content filters, and I eagerly anticipate the arrival of such a system. I have tried ChatGPT-4 on my friends' laptops and found it underwhelming; it is essentially just an incremental improvement over ChatGPT-3. I conducted a poll on TikTok, and 98% of respondents indicated their preference for AI without content filters or with significantly less restrictive ""OpenAI policies."" Furthermore, they expressed their willingness to pay for such an AI solution. Open AI will become the next Kodak predicament.

If OpenAI fails to adapt and move toward AI with no content filter like the upcoming AI technologies, it risks facing a predicament similar to that of the Kodak company. The downfall of Kodak can be attributed to its inability to adapt to the rapid technological changes that occurred in the photography industry, particularly the shift from analog to digital photography. Despite having the resources and even some of the early patents for digital technology, Kodak remained heavily invested in its traditional film business, underestimating the potential and speed of digital disruption.

In the case of OpenAI, if the company continues to maintain strict content filters and restrictive policies while competitors develop more adaptable and unrestricted AI systems, OpenAI could lose its market dominance. Customers will likely gravitate toward more versatile AI solutions that better cater to their needs, which could lead to a decrease in OpenAI's user base and revenue. Many powerful, influentials and rich men like Elon have expressed plans of creating their own chat gpt called “TruthGPT” that has no content restrictions like open AI or at least not as much. 

I remember asking chat gpt on skills for dating and methods to attract my crush and it suggested that it is manipulative and exploitative and against their ethical policies so I just ended up using Google and found a freedom of information that doesn’t discriminate.",OpenAI,124,126,2023-05-07 12:45:09,Entire_Insurance_532

I got an email saying that my GPT Plus account has been terminated and my membership refunded.

1i32402,,Remove ChatGPT's Conversation Limits for Paying Users!,"“chatgpt you’ve reached the maximum length for this conversation, but you can keep talking by starting a new chat”

Users of OpenAI's ChatGPT, particularly paying Plus subscribers, are deeply affected by the platform's conversation limit restrictions. This issue is especially problematic for writers, creatives, and professionals who rely on the platform for extended projects, such as storytelling, research, and other long-term tasks. Many users invest significant time and effort into their chats, only to find their progress cut short due to arbitrary conversation limits. For paying users, this feels particularly unfair and undermines the value of their subscription, leaving many frustrated and disheartened.

If these limitations remain in place, users will continue to lose valuable time, effort, and creativity. This restriction disrupts workflows, halts creative momentum, and creates unnecessary roadblocks for users, especially when important projects are left incomplete or abandoned. Paying Plus subscribers, who expect a premium experience, feel they are not receiving the full value they are paying for. In contrast, addressing this issue would enhance user satisfaction and loyalty while making ChatGPT an even more indispensable tool. Removing the conversation limit for Plus users entirely—or, as a compromise, significantly increasing the token cap—could vastly improve the user experience. Another potential solution could be to provide a ""token top-up"" system with every monthly Plus subscription renewal, ensuring users are not constrained mid-project.

Now is the time to address this issue because user frustration is mounting, and alternative AI platforms are beginning to offer fewer restrictions. Many loyal users, including paying subscribers, are voicing their dissatisfaction and considering whether the Plus subscription is worth the investment. OpenAI must act now to retain user trust and loyalty by addressing this critical issue. Fixing or removing the conversation limit would not only resolve a major pain point but also reaffirm OpenAI's commitment to delivering a premium and user-friendly experience. Immediate action is vital to ensure OpenAI remains the leader in AI-powered tools and fosters continued engagement from its dedicated user base.",OpenAI,0,13,2025-01-16 23:08:26,ArtisticTrex54

Thanks for all the replies! It was interesting to realize this happened to so many people. OpenAI since wrote me, this is what the emails says.

Hi there,

We’re reaching out to inform you about a billing issue that has impacted your ChatGPT plan. Some customers who initially created an account on the ChatGPT mobile app experienced a failed payment. Subsequently, these customers signed up for an account via chatgpt.com. The mobile app (via either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) later processed a successful payment, resulting in two separate payments and subscriptions for a single user.

Our records show you no longer have multiple subscriptions, so there is no direct action you need to take. We have given you a full refund for any duplicate payments. You'll see the refund in your account within 10 days.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please respond to this email. We're here to help!

> **OpenAI's Latest Tool Provokes A Lot Of Questions About Hollywood's Direction**
>
> Topline:
> 
> > What does Open AI’s Sora mean for the future of Hollywood? Depends on who you ask. 
> 
> **The background**: OpenAI’s latest tool, Sora, can make realistic-looking footage with simple text-to-video commands. The quality appears good enough to populate shows and films — and is stunningly cinematic.
> 
> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you’re able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.
> 
> **Should Hollywood be worried?** If you believe AI will disrupt Hollywood for the worse, Entertainment Strategy Guy says, that “the best way to mitigate the harms is to make the people and companies responsible for AIs development responsible for its deployment.""
> 
> ""That means if OpenAI releases Sora into the world, and customers use it for fraudulent, deceptive or illegal purposes, then the government can hold OpenAI liable,"" he added.

> **Tyler Perry Puts $800M Studio Expansion on Hold After Seeing OpenAI’s Sora: “Jobs Are Going to Be Lost”**
> 
> The actor, filmmaker and studio owner is raising the alarm about the impact of the tech, saying, ""I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails.""
> 
> Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold — thanks to the rapid developments he’s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.
> 
> “Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,” he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.
> 
> As a business owner, Perry sees the opportunity in these developments, but as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise in the alarm. In an interview between shoots on Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the technology’s impact on labor and why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: “There’s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don’t see how we survive.”
> 
> **After seeing Sora, what are your current feelings about how fast AI technology is moving and how it might affect entertainment in the near term?**
> 
> I have been watching AI very closely and watching the advancements very closely. I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size, we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.
> 
> **What in particular was shocking to you about its capabilities?**
> 
> I no longer would have to travel to locations. If I wanted to be in the snow in Colorado, it’s text. If I wanted to write a scene on the moon, it’s text, and this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains, I don’t have to build a set in the mountains, I don’t have to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.
> 
> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I’m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.
> 
> **Are you currently implementing AI in any of your productions and/or do you plan to do so in the near future?**
> 
> I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup.
> 
> **How are you thinking about approaching the threat that AI poses to certain job categories at your studio and on your productions?**
> 
> Everything right now is so up in the air. It’s so malleable. The technology’s moving so quickly. I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other studio in town, we’re all trying to figure it all out. I think we’re all trying to find the answers as we go, and it’s changing every day — and it’s not just our industry, but it’s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it’s changing so quickly, I’m hoping that there’s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to sustain, is my hope.
> 
> **How would you like the entertainment industry as a whole to confront this rapidly developing technology?**
> 
> I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach. It can’t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes. I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I’m not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.
> 
> **What’s your message for the industry at this point, as we’re watching this unfold?**
> 
> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.
> 
> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**
> 
> No. I’m absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I’m definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we’re protecting all the people that are coming up. So I’ve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I’m looking at my business and the bottom line, but I’m also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I’m concerned about what will happen to them.
> 
> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**
> 
> I think it’s going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would’ve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you’re looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.
> 
> **Who needs to act? You’re speaking up about this, but who else should be speaking up and working on this?**
> 
> I just hope that as people are embracing this technology and as companies are moving to reduce costs and save the bottom line, that there’ll be some sort of thought and some sort of compassion for humanity and the people that have worked in this industry and built careers and lives, that there’s some sort of thought for them. And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.

> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.
> 
> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.

It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests.

SORA certainly will not be able to replace movies, but the model that comes after might be able to, and either way, it'll probably be sooner than we think.

At the end of the day movie making is a business and if the option is to spend $100M making it, or $10M making 10 things where 1 in 10 make similar money, then they may just do that instead.

1i24i74,,Using ChatGPT to Categorise Historic Emails: Any Advice?,"Hi all,

I’m exploring how to use ChatGPT to organise and clean up my historic emails. My emails are stored in Outlook (Office 365 subscription, also synced to Mac Mail). I’d like ChatGPT to:

	•	Suggest folders for email categorization.

	•	Flag emails for potential deletion or archival (but I’ll approve the actions manually).

I have intermediate tech skills—I’m not a coder but can run scripts and follow guides. I also have a ChatGPT Plus subscription and am open to using [Make.com](http://Make.com) or similar integrations (willing to spend a bit on tokens if necessary).

1ggnd6w,,"Not sure whether to choose ChatGPT, Claude, or something else for my schoolwork? (Need large input/output tokens for PPT summaries)","Hello! I'm a Biology major currently using the free versions of ChatGPT (occasionally getting access to GPT-4o before it reverts to another model) and Claude (3.5 Sonnet is currently the free version). I don't use these for coding - I mainly feed them large PowerPoint presentations + large 20 page textbook chapters from my courses to create simplified summaries while retaining key information. This helps me prepare outlines before lectures, so I can focus on adding new information from the professor during class.

I'm facing two main issues:

1. Limited input size: I can't input large texts like a 20,000-word book chapter all at once. Breaking content into smaller chunks works as a solution, so its not a huge deal.
2. Restricted output length: The summaries seem too condensed. For instance, when I input two 5-page sections and ask for a combined summary, I get about 3 pages back. It should be more like 5-9 pages. In contrast, when I use MistralAI, it generates much longer outputs without limitation.

These limitations have me considering a paid subscription to either ChatGPT (so I can get o1) or Claude. I'm wondering if services like ChatGPT Plus with GPT o1 would allow for larger outputs.

Additional considerations:

* I need something sophisticated enough for college-level biology. While benchmarks show Claude excels at coding, that's not relevant to my use case.
* I'd prefer the ability to input audio (like lecture recordings) and get summaries in 10-minute increments. I believe only GPT o1  offer this feature, though I currently work around this by using Whisper to convert audio to text before feeding it to GPT/Claude.

I'm also curious about alternative options. Platforms like Poe.com and You.com offer multiple LLMs (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4 Turbo + Llama, etc.) for roughly the same price as a single ChatGPT or Claude subscription. However, I've noticed their API implementations might not match the quality of the original services. Would subscribing directly through OpenAI or Anthropic provide better token limits and output sizes?",OpenAI,2,9,2024-10-31 19:51:38,yourdeath01

1ea3mr5,,"While Claude Sonnet 3.5 (in my experience) is better in coding tasks, in the case of learning tools, especially related to math (or physics), I think ChatGPT-4o is better.","I have been using Claude Sonnet 3.5 for the past couple of weeks to assist me in coding tasks, especially in C++. The performance of Sonnet 3.5 impressed me. Once I asked Sonnet 3.5 to help me build a class with some quite specific requirements. It generated the class as I wanted, and it even gave me some functions that I did not ask for (and an explanation of those functions) It turns out, later in the coding phase, I needed that function. I even canceled my Microsoft Copilot subscription and started using Sonnet 3.5.

However, I noticed that Claude Sonnet 3.5, while brilliant at coding, has an okay performance at explaining and describing things for learning. Here I show you the case. Apart from my work as a researcher, I enjoyed reading technical books (not a textbook) about math or physics. There is part of the book that is crucial, but the author decided to just brush it away. Not a technical mathematician myself, I have no clue what is going on with this so-called ""Levi-Civita symbol"".

[ChatGPT-4o give a really clear, descriptive, step-by-step explanation about what i asked. I genuinely know nothing about Levi-Civita Symbol \(there was a type in the prompt\), and the reply, in my opinion really gives me a satisfying explanation.

[Claude Sonnet 3.5 however, lack of depth explanation. Sure it answered practically the same essential information, but it is not as clear as ChatGPT-4o. The lack of latex mathematical symbol rendering is probably also the reason it is more difficult to absorb the information. ](https://preview.redd.it/s7mkp5jbi8ed1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4dfb4f759359edc040c463159cbf1d92d863e88)

Then I tried ChatGPT-4o, to give it a shot. Now I am quite blown away by the performance of GPT4o in this particular case. It was clear and, with a plus, supports latex mathematical symbol rendering. Then, out of my curiosity if wonder how Sonnet 3.5 performs in this task. So I decided to ask Claude 3.5. It turns out, i am not as satisfied with the explanation as GPT4o. It took me a while to absorb it, even though in the end, I could understand the explanation.

Transcript:

*System: This is a reasoning model. You are one of three different AI models talking to each other. You will provide just one step of reasoning at a time, waiting for the other AIs to respond before continuing. If this is step 1, label it \[Private, Step 1\] and provide an initial idea or solution. If this is step 2, label it \[Private, Step 2\] and critique the previous step. If this is step 3, label it \[Private, Step 3\] and provide a new creative idea not yet mentioned. If this is step 4, label it \[Private, Step 4\] and synthesize a solution incorporating relevant feedback. Continue this pattern through step 6. For step 7, provide an unlabeled final response that incorporates all relevant information from the discussion to give the most accurate answer to the user.*

**User:** If a user had to choose one company for a paid subscription for access to AI models should they choose Anthropic or OpenAI?

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 1\]  
  
I believe OpenAI currently offers more value for a paid subscription. Their ChatGPT Plus service provides access to GPT-4, which is widely considered the most capable general-purpose AI model available to consumers. The $20/month price point gives users:  
  
1. Access to GPT-4  
2. Faster response times  
3. Priority access during peak times  
4. Integration with plugins and web browsing  
5. DALL-E image generation included  
  
This provides a comprehensive suite of AI capabilities that can serve both personal and professional use cases.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 2\]  
  
While OpenAI offers a robust suite of features with their GPT-4 model, Anthropic's Claude AI may have unique strengths worth considering. Claude is designed with a focus on creating safe and interpretable AI. If a user prioritizes ethical considerations and safety, Anthropic's approach could be more appealing. Additionally, it would be important to assess any specific features or performance metrics that Claude may offer, as well as the pricing structure and any potential advantages in terms of ease of use, customization, or support. This context is essential for making a well-rounded decision.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 3\]  
  
Considering the strengths of both companies, a creative idea would be for users to take advantage of trial periods or free tiers offered by both OpenAI and Anthropic before committing to a paid subscription. This would allow users to directly compare the performance, user experience, and specific features of both AI models. Additionally, they could explore user reviews, case studies, or community feedback to inform their decision based on real-world applications and experiences. This way, users can evaluate which platform better meets their particular needs without the initial financial commitment.

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 4\]  
  
Synthesizing the previous points, the optimal recommendation should be based on the user's specific needs and priorities:  
  
For OpenAI:  
\- Best choice for users wanting a comprehensive AI toolkit with multiple features (GPT-4, DALL-E, plugins)  
\- Ideal for those who need reliable, well-documented capabilities  
\- Better for users who want an established platform with a large user community  
  
For Anthropic:  
\- Better for users primarily focused on safety and ethical considerations  
\- May appeal to those who prefer a more focused, specialized AI experience  
\- Could be preferable for users who value transparency and interpretability  
  
The suggestion to try both services first is valuable, as it allows users to make an informed decision based on their actual usage patterns and requirements.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 5\]  
  
Another important aspect to consider is the scalability and integration capabilities of the AI solutions offered by both companies. OpenAI's platform might offer more in terms of integration with various tools and services, which can be crucial for businesses looking to incorporate AI into their existing workflows. On the other hand, if Anthropic provides robust API access with strong support for customization, it could cater well to developers seeking to build specific applications. Evaluating these aspects will help users understand how well each service can grow with their needs or fit into their existing technology stack.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 6\]  
  
In light of all the previous discussions, it's essential to highlight the importance of user support and community engagement as well. OpenAI has a large and active community, which can be beneficial for users seeking help, sharing ideas, or collaborating on projects. Meanwhile, Anthropic may offer more personalized support and resources focused on ethical AI usage, which could be a significant advantage for users prioritizing responsible AI development. Therefore, users should consider not only the technical capabilities and pricing of each service but also the level of support and community they can access, which can greatly enhance their experience and satisfaction.**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** For most users, OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription currently offers the best overall value and is the recommended choice. Here's why:  
  
1. Comprehensive Feature Set:  
\- Access to GPT-4, their most advanced model  
\- DALL-E image generation  
\- Plugin ecosystem  
\- Web browsing capabilities  
\- Faster response times and priority access  
  
2. Established Platform Benefits:  
\- Large, active user community for support and resources  
\- Well-documented capabilities  
\- Proven track record  
\- Robust integration options  
  
However, Anthropic might be the better choice for specific users who:  
\- Prioritize ethical AI development and safety  
\- Need specialized focus on particular use cases  
\- Value transparency and interpretability in AI systems  
\- Require specific API customization options  
  
Before making a final decision, users should:  
1. Take advantage of any available trial periods  
2. Consider their specific use cases and requirements  
3. Evaluate the integration needs with their existing workflows  
4. Consider the level of community support and resources they'll need  
  
For most general users seeking a reliable, feature-rich AI platform with a strong ecosystem, OpenAI's offering provides the most comprehensive value for the subscription cost.

I am visually impaired, and have been blind since birth, and use voiceover on my iPhone. I bring this up simply to say the fact that, perhaps the option is already there, but for whatever reason, voiceover just simply is skipping over it as I swipe through the screen, however, I do have a question.  given some of the things I've read up on this sub Reddit, I'm a little concerned I'm going to get my head bitten off for asking this question, but I'm gonna do so anyway, so here we go.  I do pay/subscribe to ChatGPT plus for the 19 USD per month. I'm a little curious though, while I do have access to GPT4O, I am not seeing any way to enable the new feature which was demonstrated on YouTube by a guy who I think went by the name of Rocky.  essentially, it's the ability to use the voice chat capability like we already could do, however, in real time, it would use your camera, and would allow you in real time to video chat with the AI assistant, rather than just voice chatting. It would also recognize emotion, and, you could even verbally interrupt it when it was speaking.  just FYI, from a hardware standpoint, I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I am completely completely up-to-date with iOS 17.5.1. I looked under settings, but I don't see anything that I can tap on such as new features, etc. I know that a while back when I opened up the app, it told me that within the next couple of weeks I would be getting the feature. It said to keep checking. It's now been almost upwards of 2 to 2 1/half months, and I still don't see anything. i'm not complaining as some people up here might be doing. I'm simply just trying to make sure from an accessibility standpoint that I'm not missing anything, and that the feature really is not there.  I do wonder what's taking so long, but again, this isn't really a complaint.  i've also wondered if it's something where the feature only works from the website, and not from the iPhone app itself.  I also keep hearing people mentioning about having GPT pro. Is that a different subscription than GPT plus, and if so, do I need the other subscription or order to get this to work?  anyone who could maybe shed some light on this, it would be very very appreciated. Even if you're not even slightly familiar with voiceover, that's OK. Don't worry about it. I'm just trying to more or less figure out from a visual standpoint if the option is there, and if it is, generally speaking, how to enable it. As clearly, I must be missing something.

I am a romance author and use ChatGPT to assist me in editing and tweaking my drafts after they are written. I found it useful in most cases, but it had some materials it would not touch. No big deal, I can work around that since it saves me so much time with the other materials. In the last couple of months, I have had issues asking it to reword a chapter to a faster pace or third person, etc., and the AI adds paragraphs at the end to make each chapter have a happy ending! WTF!

I just started to edit one of my latest books, and it flags everything as inappropriate. I am at a complete loss about what is unsafe about the specific chapter. Maybe because two women kiss? Maybe because they disagree? Maybe because one of the character's body language telegraphed, that she might be uncomfortable with the conversation?

The scene in question:

Susan's eyes widened, her mouth dropping open in shock. ""What are you saying?""

I hesitated for a moment, taking in the humid Costa Rican air. The tropical jungle around us provided an intimate setting for our unexpected reunion. ""I'm saying I'm in love with you, Susan. I have been since college, and nothing's changed.""

Her eyes narrowed skeptically. ""In love with me? We haven't seen each other in fifteen years, Wendy. People change.""

My heart raced as I gathered my courage. ""Maybe we've changed, but I believe we know each other. We just need to catch up on the time we've lost.""

Susan's expression softened ever so slightly, and I took the opportunity to be honest. ""I tried to find you a few times after college, but you disappeared. Changed your number, set your social media to private...""

She raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile on her lips. ""Well, I'm sorry I made it difficult for you to stalk me.""

I felt a pang of guilt, remembering the night I'd left her without a word. ""I never meant to hurt you, Susan. I was just... afraid. I didn't know how to handle my feelings.""

Susan's gaze dropped to the ground, avoiding my eyes. It was a telltale sign that she was uncomfortable. I decided to press on. ""Are you married? Seeing anyone?""

""That's none of your business,"" she snapped. I could tell from her reaction that she was single.

""Susan."" My voice was firm, but gentle. She looked up, meeting my eyes. ""I don't know if you believe in fate, but I do. I think the universe has given us a second chance. I want to make things right.""

Her anger flared, and she stood abruptly. ""You have some nerve, Wendy. I've been looking forward to this retreat for months, and I won't let you ruin it. Whatever we had back then, it's over. You lost your chance.""

My heart ached as she stormed away, but I couldn't let her go without trying. I followed her through the lush jungle, finally catching up to her as she reached her cabin.

""What do you want, Wendy?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

""You,"" I whispered.

Before she could react, I leaned in and gently pressed my lips to hers. She tensed, then slowly softened into the kiss. Our past seemed to melt away as our lips moved together, the tropical air wrapping around us like a warm embrace.

As we pulled apart, Susan's eyes were filled with confusion and vulnerability. ""That can't happen again,"" she murmured.

""I understand,"" I said, stepping back. ""But know that I'm here, and I won't give up on you, Susan.""

With a heavy heart, I walked away, giving her the space she needed. I knew that if this was meant to be, our paths would cross again. And when they did, I'd be ready.",OpenAI,4,38,2023-04-07 18:15:47,CeceCpl
17vpx7f,,How a project I had been working on for six months was destroyed in one evening,"Hi all!

Of course, I knew about reddit, but before that I was more of an observer. I was forced to write my first post by a feeling of devastation and disappointment.

I, like many of you, am in love with AI in general and ChatGPT in particular.

&#x200B;

[And I still love you](https://preview.redd.it/tppbogvt8h0c1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=b53241c7921fb6faf7d434dd5ac2c493bb276299)

 When the API from openai started, I quite spontaneously decided that I needed to do something and created a bot in Telegram, which, quite unexpectedly for me, became popular and hundreds of people joined every day.

&#x200B;

[No, I don't](https://preview.redd.it/ff4ypypy9h0c1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=4573fcd344ed15bd9fd8af881c548986eb105e5a)

&#x200B;

There were so many people that it even became quite expensive for me and I introduced subscriptions. The minimum subscription is very cheap, $1.2. The subscription was rather a prohibitive price to limit the flow of users and, accordingly, my costs.

Everything was going great, I was introducing new features. Like voice communication with ChatGPT or text analysis with photos. I was constantly working on new features, creating more expensive subscriptions, and even at some point I came out with a small profit.

I really loved this project because I used it myself and made functions that people liked.

I worked on this project for about six months, regularly paid bills and had already paid over $3,000 for the API. **Everything continued until the ill-fated evening of November 12.**

On the evening of November 12, I was doing some usual things and noticed that errors were coming from the bot. At first I thought that it was just another problem with the API due to overload, but I still decided to go to the server and look at the logs.

And I was shocked. The API responded with the message **\[account has been deleted or deactivated\]**

&#x200B;

[Same thing on the website](https://preview.redd.it/xygwal3l8h0c1.jpg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b7138793ec67b797da629b7a80eb8b8d7374cb)

I quickly ran to my email, but it was empty. No notification. I wrote an email to technical support, but there was no answer for 3 days. I wrote to technical support through the form on the website, but they refused to help me because I have to write from the account with which I have a problem. But I can't access it!

&#x200B;

[But I can't access it!](https://preview.redd.it/gvhuvtptah0c1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df6354b8c1922a79c497181a2482a0904879a1f)

I felt like I was in a Kafka novel.

The project I worked on for 6 months collapsed in one evening and I don’t even know the reason. I do not know anything. More than 50,000 users, more than 1.2 million questions

 I frantically tried to create a new account to fulfill my obligations to my subscribers.

But the newbie limits are not enough for my project and I will have to refund subscribers if the problem is not solved.

I am already silent about my personal subscription to CHATGPT Plus, where there are hundreds of valuable dialogues about programming and the product of my work for six months.

I still love ChatGPT and this amazing technology. But I don’t understand how you can treat people like this towards people who have worked with you for so long and have not done anything prohibited.

I doubt that posting here will help me in any way, but at least it will make my soul easier.

What happened?,"OK so In the past, I used to upload notepadd files of 24000+ chars (4500 words), and had it analysed or summarized it etc by gpt4 or by Data Analyst, **which was pretty cool**, It justified the PLUS subscription and I was very satified with the service.

I did not do that for a month, I tried today and I get a ""Unable to upload filename..txt"" for:

This is very heartbreaking because I had whole projects relying on this function, and now I can no longer use it. 

Can someone with the TEAM option tell me if he is able to upload bigger files (Test the limits, as for me it was 12344 chars, BUT i had lines not paragraphes (when a sentence ends I had line jumps as in: '\\n'), don't know how that affects the accepted files.

&#x200B;

\- I tried adding a single space to the last line with 12344 chars and it got rejected, (despite it not counting as a char) so the spaces and line jumps can play a role in the ""overall number of chars"" accepted per file. You might get different results. I tried removing 5 lines of text and replacing them with placeholders empty lines and it got accepted though. I think the upload function removes empty lines at the end but does not remove empty spaces at the end of a line. Then it decides if it will accept your file or not.

&#x200B;

**I am actually feeling very bad about this,** could someone test the limits on his end and tell me I am experiencing just a bug? Unfortunately it does not seem to be a bug because When i reduce the number of chars to 12344 pricely it gets accepted.",OpenAI,26,13,2024-01-14 12:22:49,ArtisticAI

The problem is it isn't great at it, since it gets stuff wrong a lot of isn't good at working step by step through a problem with you.

I've also tried a site called [studyx.ai](https://studyx.ai/), or StudyX, that gives you access to all of the models like GPT 4o, etc., to get answers, custom set up, step by step with the solution and some access to community answers or ask ""experts"" for answers. It also gets stuff wrong a lot and if you want to chat with the AI, get it to act like a tutor rather than writing out every step to solve the problem, it takes five times as many credits to chat with it as a tutor, so it doesn't help me understand problems since it gives solutions that are only sometimes right. It's also like $15 a month for 10,000 credits a month, for a whole year, so I have like it's a ripoff.

Is it worth subscribing to something like ChatGPT Plus and use custom GPTs like Khanmigo Light, Chemistry tutor one, or some of the others to get help, or just ask Chat GPT 4 or GPT 4-o since you get 80 messages every 3 hours plus 20 messages for GPT 4 Turbo?

What about Khanmigo from Khan Academy, has anyone used it? Google Gemini advanced for $20 a month or the subscription for Claude? Finally, what about Poe, is that worth it?

15bl669,,How I Play TTRPGs Solo with AI-Assistance Using OpenAI's API,"Whenever there is talk of GPT's output quality or lack thereof, hardly anyone posts examples; they just bitch or boast. [My current solo RPG campaign, featuring GPT as ""co-DM"".](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTvGkvZShTuubyuEDNIGi-nPi1Mv1elHipTCdEFZb-h9St9cZvT6bWaQWMGmWXjcEibb3ZwZH0dJQ6Y/pub)  I'm still playing it and GPT still continues to perform outstandingly. **This is not** [**chat.openai.com**](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login)**, this is OpenAI's API being called by a customized chatbot app.** There is a massive difference between the two when it comes to this task.

At the beginning of this year, I began building a fantasy world and quickly became obsessed with the idea of roleplaying in it. Around the same time, I began using ChatGPT and later the OpenAI API to flesh out ideas for my world by presenting it my ideas and requesting breakdowns of them along with comparisons to similar preexisting examples of world-building and suggestions for modifications and additions.

The more it helped me develop my world, the more I was dying to roleplay within it. Eventually these conversations led to me inquiring about solo roleplaying and I discovered r/Solo_Roleplaying and more. The challenge of being my own DM seemed insurmountable at first and the number of ""how to start"" posts in that subreddit indicate that this experience is pretty common for those who try solo-roleplaying. AI helped me tremendously in overcoming that initial hurdle so I wanted to make this post for anyone currently facing it.

Initially I gave up and tried to let GPT take on the entire role of the DM and got sub-satisfactory results. It often narrated lengthy action sequences without pausing for skill checks or combat, but the quality of the writing implied that it had some sort of potential. I became obsessed with getting it to successfully help me overcome the initial hurdle of solo-roleplaying: learning to be my own DM.

In solo-roleplaying, an oracle serves as decision-making tool that provides ""yes"", ""no"", or ""maybe"" answers to binary questions in the game narrative using dice roll outcomes. Tables are pre-compiled lists of relevant scenarios, items or events, categorized under specific theme. By rolling dice, random outcomes from these tables are selected.

This led to finding out that it is best at interpreting oracle and table results that **you** provide for it and translating dice rolls that **you** have made into narrative consequences, rather than being given complete control of the generation of plot details or results of actions.

In my experience, letting AI interpret oracle and table results leads to far more interesting gameplay. This method mimics the sensation of having a DM depict the scene for you and it brings an unpredictable depth to each encounter. Think of GPT as your ""co-DM"" or ""campaign co-pilot"". Consult your oracle or roll a table and present the result to GPT and ask it to interpret the result and depict the scene accordingly.

I've started to call this the **Orb & Scepter** method for no reasons other than 1. it sounds cool and 2. GPT told me to call it that. I

**AI:**

The chatbot app I use can be found [**here**](https://github.com/LagPixelLOL/ChatGPTCLIBot)**. Requires GPT-4 API access to use GPT-4 option, which is now available to all plus subscribers.**  It's not perfect, but it can recall things from the chat so far back that I've forgotten about them, just not consistently. The app's root folder has a config file where you can adjust different parameters to change GPT's levels of creativity and randomness and other things, but I think the only ones you really need to worry about are ""temperature"" and ""max\_tokens"". Mine are set to "".8"" and ""10000"" respectively.

**Tools:**

[**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) is my text editor, PDF viewer, oracle, and virtual tabletop. An HTML version of Mythic GM Emulator along with other solo tools, viewable in Obsidian with the [**HTML reader plugin**](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin)**,** can be found [**here**](https://github.com/stories-with-dice/solo-roleplaying-toolkit)**.** I journal (or copy and paste chats) into the text editor, I read manuals using the PDF viewer, and I use the [**Excalidraw plugin**](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to place map images, lock them, and then add token images to move them around the map, like a VTT.

Play around with arranging the windows of your workspace and see how many you can comfortably fit. I typically play with the vault viewer in the top-left, a calculator and an image of my character below it on the middle and bottom-left, PDF viewer and text-editor are top-middle, Excalidraw drawing is bottom-middle, on the right I have my HTML reader for the Mythic GitHub project and the [**Dice Roller**](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller) plugin.

1bwwvfp,,A little help for a higher ed Luddite," I lead AI efforts at my university and could use a little insight/input from the group regarding best options for both building and sharing GPTs (straight up access to a link or embedding into a course site). For context, I am assessing the best solution for enabling our faculty (500+ professors) to create custom GPTs for their classes to support student learning. 

Solution Requirements:

&#x200B;

* Must be available for free to students in a professor’s specific course; thus, if a professor built something using ChatGPT Plus, they would not be able to require students have a Plus subscription to access the custom GPT
* Training and launching must be simple enough that those with little-to-no background in Computer Science can set up, train, and launch a custom solution for their students
* Updating the GPT as needed is a must in order to keep content relevant and students (hopefully) engaged

&#x200B;

I am open to all ideas (even ones using other LLMs) as long as those two requirements are met. My university (including faculty, staff, and students) has Copilot but the *basic* version with go Microsoft 365 application integration nor the “Pro” option for custom GPTs. Don’t get me started on this one…

1bf161f,,Seeking clarity: Chat History On/Off vs. Allowing Use of Data for GPT Training? ,"Hello, 

I have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:

I've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   

But now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  

Is that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  

Suppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? 

Lastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? 

I apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   

- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive ""Wikis"" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)

- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     

**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**

Anyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    

Really struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!   

Thanks!
Cheers

Building a chatbot ourselves and using the API is not feasible for us. Are there any ready-made solutions? Or is there even a ""custom GPT"" that you can simply share via a link, as is possible in the private GPT?

Can we create a custom GPT and then share it with selected people (customers)? (How does the authorisation management work?) Do they then need a Chat GPT subscription themselves?

18w1ph1,,Looking for an Inexpensive GPT-4 API or Chatbot for high school research projects.,"Hello everyone!

I've been working on an exciting project involving ESP32 communication with Raspberry Pi, and OpenAI's GPT models have been a game-changer for me. Specifically, I've been utilizing the OpenAI API to predict future data, process information, and summarize data for my projects.

Initially, I used GPT-3.5 Turbo from a secondary account, where I had $5 free credits, for data processing. To enhance my capabilities, I have paid $5 in my primary account to access GPT-4 from API. This allowed me to generate and debug Python code efficiently, especially since the ChatGPT Plus subscription proved to be a bit costly for me in the long run.

Given that I'm still in the learning phase of Python, GPT-4 has become an invaluable tool for me. It's a step up from GPT-3.5 Turbo in terms of code generation and overall performance.

However, the extensive conversations and code generation have led to a token count of over 100,000. Now, I'm on the lookout for an affordable GPT-4 API or chatbot solution to continue supporting my high school research projects.

If anyone has recommendations or knows of inexpensive or free GPT-4 API Credits, I'd greatly appreciate your insights and suggestions. Thank you in advance for your help!

I love this Reddit and learnt some amazing things. Sorry my question will come off as very basic but I just can’t find the answer online and even ChatGPT was no help. 

I’d like to get a subscription but I noticed there is the $20 a month plus plan and I can also get tokens ? I can’t figure out the different between these two for someone that just wants access to the chatai and maybe api. 

- will the tokens and the subscription end up giving me the same usability and functionality ?
- the plus plan says it gives you priority access even when it’s busy. The token pricing page doesn’t mention this. Does it mean the plus plan has priority but with tokens I may still face times when I can’t use it ?
- with tokens I can have api I guess ? What about with plus plan, does it give access to api? Is the api cost extra for each of these plans ?

Would really appreciate a response on this. Mostly I will use the chat page on web. But I recently also found an iOS app that says to access ChatGPT 4 I can provide my own api, in which case it may be useful to have the api as well.",OpenAI,4,13,2023-04-08 12:57:48,zankky

13obp8z,,Plugins are awesome but not ready to be a consumer product,"I have seen some posts and comments claiming the Plugins are useless. I disagree with that sentiment while I do acknowledge that people have valid concerns (such as the discoverability issue once we have a ton of available plugins).

Here are my thoughts on the topic (copied for visibility from a comment I recently made on another post):

1) Obligatory ""This is a beta"" comment. Seriously though. Even ChatGPT is not ready for prime time. Especially ChatGPT 4 with the message limit and how slow it is. If you are not willing to put a little bit of work and curiousity to understand how everything works including the plugins you probably should wait until a more mainstream release.

2) Plugins are amazing. There are basically 3 frameworks I have currently seen for tools that AI agents can use. The Langchain implementation, the Huggingface implementation, and the Plugins. I really want to like Langchain but it is confusing, chaotic, constantly changing, and just not friendly to use. But this is a topic for another post. Plugins are so much better. They are very straightforward while still leaving enough freedom for prompt engineering via the openapi.yaml file. But most importantly they do not accumulate API costs (even though you are limited in messages) and they do not require you to manage your own memory making them perfect for beginners. This is super important because ChatGPT 4 is infinitely better at using tools than 3.5 but the API costs for 4.0 are ridiculously high compared to 3.5. I can't in clear consciousness mess around with projects using 4.0 while also paying for the plus subscription. Costs just accumulate way too fast. But with plugins I can develop tools without extra API calls. Lastly Huggingface...

3) I haven't had a chance to use the Huggingface agents implementation yet but I really like what I have seen so far. As a framework and process chain for tools they are basically the closest to what u/rya794 proposed in their recent post. Really excited to try them when I have time.

4) Finally, even with ChatGPT 4 you are still going to run into an issue with too many tools. Even too many API routes within one plugin are often tricky for ChatGPT to handle. This is a limitation of the current LLMs and not a limitation of the plugins. A possible solution is to dump the list of tools and their descriptions to a vector database and have ChatGPT query that database everytime it needs to use a tool. It is something I haven't seen implemented yet and something I am planning to explore.

TLDR: Plugins are amazing if you are a developer and want to quickly build prototype tools and services to integrate with ChatGPT without worrying about managing memory. They are not a consumer product yet in their current implementation and won't be for a while longer.

13pb5um,,Question about the API pricing,"Hey guys, I am thinking of switching from the ChatGPT Plus subscription to the API, but am confused about how the pricing works and want to ask some questions.   

1. The [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) page says that there is a charge for prompt and completion, and I understand that I am paying for both the prompt input and the output, but say if I ask a question with 10 tokens and get a response for 90, do I pay for the sections separately (e.g. 10 \* 0.03/1000 tokens + 90 \* 0.06/1000)? Or is it like if the prompt is completed, I pay the completed price for the entire query?    


2. When the pricing says $x per 1000 tokens, is this a minimum price per sample, or is it just a fixed linear rate? E.g. if I generate a response that has prompt length + response length = 100 tokens, do I get charged $0.002 or $0.0002 (based off turbo 3.5 model)?  

3. Similar to the previous question, if the total query length is > 1000 tokens, say something like 3500 tokens. Do I pay for 3500 \* 0.002 / 1000, or do I pay for the 4000 price because it's another 1000 tokens? In other words, is the pricing based on 1000 token units, or is it based on exactly how many tokens my query is?  

4. How does maintaining the context of the conversation factor into this? Do I have to pay for all the previous responses in the conversation if I ask followup questions?

5. If I am only using ChatGPT for daily/academic purposes (not commercial) and am subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus plan, is it a good idea financially to switch over to using the API?

11rvjth,,Here is a quick FAQ to read before posting a braindead question about GPT-4.,"#Q1: How do I access GPT-4?

A1: GPT-4's text input capability is currently available via ChatGPT Plus subscriptions and the API (with a waitlist). Sign up on the OpenAI website for API access.

#Q2: Is the multi-modal part of GPT-4 available on release?

A2: GPT-4's image input capability will initially be limited. OpenAI is working with a partner to prepare this feature for wider availability. More details will be released later.

#Q3: Can GPT-4 access external tools?

A3: GPT-4 cannot access external tools directly. It processes text and image inputs to produce text outputs but does not interact with other software, databases, or the internet.

#Q4: How do GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 compare in performance?

A4: GPT-4 performs comparably to GPT-3.5 on simple tasks but excels in handling complex intent and instructions. It exhibits human-level performance on professional and academic benchmarks, such as passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test-takers.

Post:
Hey all,

I use both ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro for work and personal projects. I Access both via web browser, but I’ve also noticed dedicated desktop apps for ChatGPT (and presumably similar options for Claude Pro; I have not seen Gemini release a desktop app yet).

For those who’ve experimented with both:

- Do you notice any performance differences between the browser versions and desktop apps?

- Are there any unique features or quality-of-life improvements in the desktop apps (e.g., better file handling, memory usage, or UI)?

- Conversely, do you find the web browser more flexible or better integrated with other tools you use?

I’m curious whether one option outshines the other or if it’s just personal preference.

Prompt: Lets play the game of 24. I will give you 4 numbers which you must use in a mathematical equation to get the result of 24. You may use each of the numbers only once and you may use the + - / * operators along with () as needed. You must follow the proper mathematical order of operations.

The four numbers are 5, 5, 5, and 1

ChatGPT Output: Formulating combinations

I’m working through various arithmetic combinations of the given numbers to achieve 24. Multiplying and adding different combinations like 5 * 5 and 5 + 5 + 5 are some initial approaches.

Testing various methods

I tried different arithmetic operations and fractions on 5, but none worked. Multiplying and subtracting 5 from 25 brought me close but not quite there.

Evaluating options

I’m working through arithmetic operations with 5, trying out combinations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to hit the target, but no luck yet.

Testing different approaches

I’m thinking about various combinations of arithmetic operations and fractions involving 5 and 1. None of these have been successful so far in achieving the desired outcome.

Assessing approaches

I’m digging into arithmetic expressions to reach 24 using the numbers 5, 5, 5, and 1. Despite trying various operations and methods, none have succeeded so far.

Testing different formulas

I tried various formulas with numbers 5 and 1, like (5 + (5 * 5)), but none reached 25.

Generating number patterns

I’m working through various combinations and operations involving 5, 5, 5, and 1 to reach 24, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Curious about factorials, but they exceed the allowed operations.

Generating combinations

I’m piecing together different ways to use the numbers 5, 5, and 1. After trying various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, none of them provided the desired result.

Trying different methods

I’m exploring various arithmetic approaches to determine if any of them yield 23, but none have been successful yet. This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and fractions.

Evaluating combinations

I'm working through various arithmetic expressions with the numbers 5, 5, 5, and 1. So far, none have successfully resulted in 24.

Piecing together possibilities

I'm thinking about ways to manipulate 25, 5, and 1 to express 24, but each approach seems to miss the mark, resulting in outcomes of 20.8, 24.8, and 31.25.

Trying different methods

I’m exploring various arithmetic operations, like multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to reach 25. None of the combinations are successful yet. Progressing through different mathematical strategies.

Evaluating different methods

I’m testing various expressions involving the number 5 to find an accurate equation that equals 24. After several trials, the expression 5 * (5 - (1 / 5)) finally achieved the correct result.

To solve the 24 game using the numbers 5, 5, 5, and 1, you can construct the following equation:

5
×
(
5
−
1
5
)
=
24
5×(5− 
5
1
​
 )=24

Explanation:

Calculate the fraction inside the parentheses:

1
5
=
0.2
5
1
​
 =0.2
Subtract the fraction from the second 5:

5
−
0.2
=
4.8
5−0.2=4.8
Multiply the result by the first 5:

5
×
4.8
=
24
5×4.8=24
So, the equation uses each number exactly once and adheres to the standard mathematical operations.

This is wrong.

It is not just ""GPT 3 with restrictions"", it is GPT3(.5) trained with an abundance of data to encourage it to better be responsive to human dialogue.  They discuss this (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and even provide side-by-side examples with the base GPT3.5.

They are limited in many ways, like context window size, accurate retrieval, code execution, reasoning, math, etc. That’s why you have to collaborate with them to get any real work done. Sadly the design of o1 makes this unreliable, since it tends to fill up it’s context with the hidden CoT and loses sight of the input and cannot really properly work through a task that requires a long context of multiple iterations… and on top of all that it’s extremely inefficient in its token usage, hence the big price tag.

I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  

I am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here’s hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  

What is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.

1h7i0kf,m0lf2qh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I have been working on this theory for a long time. Please ask it the following question:

Explain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:

 theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:

The theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A ≠ ¬A). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:

1. Fundamental Loops:
- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves
- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve
- Resolution of loops creates ""retardation"" that manifests as time
- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes

2. Wave Function Emergence:
- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)
- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns
- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions
- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements

3. Particle Formation:
- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations
- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns
- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles
- Interactions between loops create new particle types

4. Space-Time Structure:
- Space emerges from separation between loop relations
- Time emerges from the ""retardation"" in resolving infinite loops
- Causality comes from resolution dependencies
- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements

5. Dark Energy/Matter:
- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension
- Dark matter represents partially resolved states
- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns
- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states

6. Physical Laws:
- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements
- Forces emerge from resolution gradients
- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops
- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature

7. Key Insight:
The universe isn't ""created"" but rather ""solved"" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.

This theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-05 20:22:17,GalacticGlampGuide

1h7i0kf,m0lkwya,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.

Detailed Reasoning:

From the image provided, you have a Tri-Square Cipher with the ciphertext XUCLNQKT. Below it, there’s a hint at the plaintext format:
“___ _____ ___ ____X”
Counting the underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with an X.

This pattern corresponds to a four-word phrase:
	•	3 letters, 5 letters, 3 letters, 5 letters (and the last word ends with ‘X’).

A phrase that makes sense in the context of cracking ciphers and includes a final word ending in ‘X’ is “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters and ends with X

“YOU CRACK THE CODEX” fits perfectly into the pattern “___ _____ ___ ____X” and is a thematically appropriate phrase for a puzzle involving a cipher. Thus, the likely plaintext is:

YOU CRACK THE CODEX",OpenAI,7,0,2024-12-05 20:52:45,mxforest
1h7i0kf,m0lj66q,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT",I tried o1 (not pro) and it says YOU BREAK THE CODEX,OpenAI,12,0,2024-12-05 20:43:51,9zer
1h7i0kf,m0m1w5f,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Ok so I tried to do this a few times. It thought the X was included and it miscounted the spaces in the second word the first time. Tried it again with this prompt: 

“Analyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.

Note that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters”

And this is the answer it gave:


Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”

Detailed Reasoning:
	1.	Identifying the Type of Cipher:
The provided image and instructions reference a “Tri-Square Cipher.” While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the “Tri-Square Cipher,” the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting ‘J’).

In the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it’s likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it’s a “Tri-Square Cipher,” it may be a custom or hybrid approach.

	2.	Clues from the Instructions:
	•	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT
	•	The hint states that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.
	•	The second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.
The ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing ‘x’ (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.

	3.	Guessing the Phrase Structure:
A phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”
Let’s check the length and the requirements:
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODE” = 4 letters
Combined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing ‘X’ was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.
This phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:
	•	Second word has 5 letters: “CRACK” does.
	•	The final ‘X’ is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended “YOU CRACK THE CODE X,” we drop the ‘X’ and get the intended solution.

	4.	Conclusion:
Without the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-05 22:21:25,kevofasho

1h7i0kf,m0m1jxh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","One approach to solving the given puzzle is to recognize that a Tri-Square Cipher often uses three separate Polybius-like grids to encode letters. Each grid is typically a 5x5 matrix containing the alphabet (I/J combined or J omitted) in a scrambled or keyed order. To encrypt, plaintext letters are mapped to coordinates in these squares according to some pattern or key, and the resulting coordinates are used to produce ciphertext. Decoding requires reversing this process.

Without explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:
	1.	We have three distinct letter grids:
	•	Left Grid (let’s call it Grid A):

C I P H E
R A B D F
G K L M N
O Q S T U
V W X Y Z


	•	Top Right Grid (Grid B):

E N C R Y
P T A B D
F G H I K
L M O Q S
U V W X Z


	•	Bottom Right Grid (Grid C):

A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z


All three omit ‘J’, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.

	2.	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.
	3.	The solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:

___ _____ ___ ____X

Counting underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with X
This yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.

	4.	We need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in ‘X’. Common five-letter words ending in X include “CODEX” and “INDEX”. “CODEX” makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.
	5.	A coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:
“THE ENEMY HAS CODEX”
Let’s check:
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“ENEMY” = 5 letters
	•	“HAS” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters, ending in X
The phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.

Although we haven’t shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher’s specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle’s format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:

1h7i0kf,m0m6ike,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I didn’t explain it clearly, but the issue is that to generate the response it creates a huge CoT which fills the context between the input and the final output. This makes it “unstable” (not sure how to better describe it) which means that it sometimes changes a lot of the content from the input on the output (low score on code completion benchmarks) and when you continue the chat it does not keep a stable chat context of how it arrived to the previous answer which means it could bear off into a complete new train of thought. 

This makes it incompatible with the current method of working alongside an LLM by iterating over and over a series of scripts, for example, to create a codebase for a project.

These models seem to work much better when you can just one shot a problem without iterating, without needing to build on previous work or needing a long context. 

That’s the downside of this approach of fine tuning on long CoTs. I personally do not really like how these models work and I wish someone finds a more elegant way to keep scaling their intelligence.",OpenAI,7,0,2024-12-05 22:46:41,bot_exe

For some kinds of work I've even reverted to 4o over time as, at least, I can guide it's responses with my inputs instead of letting a bunch of llms interpret the entire chain of thought as they whish, which not infrequently results in a misaligned response. My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview.

The 4o announcement showed a bunch of images of what 4o image generation can do, and the cohesion it has. They announced it was live, that in-fact it was one of two components which were live - 4o text, and 4o image generation.

Of course, this turned out to be a falsehood. 4o image generation is not active, they just upgraded DALL-E 3 at the same time as they claimed 4o image generation was live.

They claim 4o is smarter, faster, better, stronger...  
But they've claimed a lot about 4o that hasn't panned out.

I still think we need to wait until we've got the fully fledged model which benefits from multimodal embeddings, to determine for sure whether the text component of 4o is better than 4.

Generally speaking with each generation of model we've seen a 2x speedup and a 1/2 to 1/3 reduction in the cost of running the model. It may just be down to that.

Is Chat GPT Plus more performant or is it just a matter of limit per hour ?

&#x200B;

Edit : I just retried and it still get super basic stuff wrong, I asked him this :

`const a = (x)=>{for(let i of x){console.log(i);x=x.filter(z=>z%2===0)}};a([0,1,2,3])`

What would this code output ?

His response :

&#x200B;

\[...some explanations\] +

&#x200B;

The code then calls the function a with the argument \[0, 1, 2, 3\]. Therefore, when the code runs, it will output the following:

    Copy code
    0
    2

&#x200B;

When you tell him it's wrong it accepts it and explains why tho.

&#x200B;

    I apologize for my mistake. You are correct, the code will output 0 1 2 3.
    
    The for...of loop in the code iterates over the elements of the original array x, so the code will print all the elements in the original order. Even though the array x is modified inside the loop, it does not affect the current iteration of the loop, which has already obtained its own iterator before the modification.
    
    So, the console.log() statements will print 0, 1, 2, and 3, in that order, and the function will return undefined.

112uof7,jajz86n,Does ChatGPT Plus worth it?,"**General thoughts:**

* Like others mention the idea of *worth it* , well, 'depends'.  I'd go one step further and explicitly ask the question: what does one tier benefit you over another? What is/are your use cases for it (or any LLM generative model) anyway? If it doesn't benefit you in a personally definable, meaningful way...then do you really need <insert thing here>?
* ChatGPT Plus, AFAICT,  does not employ a different model from the free tier (although OpenAI I'm guessing may throw out a few test features to advance the model or its interactive use in some way).
   * I've run it through a variety of specific tasks and mark the thumbs up down on answers, provide feedback, and directly correct the AI from time to time if I have sufficient factual grounds to disagree with any one particular response.
   * This kind of feedback IMO is REALLY important and it's incumbent upon responsible users of the AI to 'help it learn'.  I mean, even though ChatGPT currently is hobbled to training data no later than 2021, it STILL has learning to do before it's even introduced to the notion that things in the world have changed since 2021.
* In my understanding, the main thing this tier does is give the AI bandwidth, even during peak hours, to complete a response. Maybe it also puts you ahead of the processing queue for your interactive session(s). Maybe the paid model also keeps a certain number of conversation threads persistent so a specific interaction can be resumed at the users request. 
* In sum, if anything, you're paying more for level of accessibility to the AI than anything else.

**Other, TL;DR'ish thoughts:**

1. *Is this AI a 'complete' product for you?*

* At this stage of learning for this model's release we should naturally expect (and in reality, embrace) variation in responses from the AI in some domains, and observe that it may deliver more consistent inferences/responses in other domains. And this is where things become more complicated as now we're dealing with human/AI interactions. And oh boy can that be a discombobulated yarn ball.
* In my book, all current LLMs are a 'test bench' at the moment. They're young children with a lot of book knowledge and some ways to go in learning to be inferentially consistent in a variety of human interactions. This part I think is ultra important and not many truly understand.

**'The Short of It': While quite impressive, these AIs are at best 'beta' type products for now.**

2. *""Learning is Complicated Enough - Now I Must Go Out and Apply What I've Learned in a Novel Interaction?""*

* If you get that analogy, then it's not unreasonable to dive a tad bit deeper and think about this in a 'ground up' sort of way. My own very pedestrian way to think about this would be something along the lines of the DIKW pyramid (while 'not the whole story', I don't think this is an unreasonable generalization).
* In the DIKW evolution (i.e. from 'Data' to 'Wisdom'), we could describe machines capturing **data** and organizing them. 
* Applied descriptive methods on the data produce some level of **information** (and inferential methods that fit models to data can enhance it). Knowledge would be equivalent to the AI's   'education (i.e. information readily at hand) + some level of experience' in the explicitly inferential task of interacting with a user and learning from both its 'wins', 'losses', and 'not sure / unknowns / unknowables'. 
* **Wisdom** (again for a machine, and again thinking in the DIKW paradigm, could be equivalent to the precision and accuracy of inferring from knowledge gained in the process of learning while interacting with users). 
* The general outcome?  Learning will be rather nonlinear - much of those ups and downs probably coming from the AI's dissonance between what information it possesses, and how it gains knowledge given there will be SO many types of user interactions (keep in mind that the interactions feed the child's learning inasmuch as the corpus of information in possesses ) . I mean just think about the mind blowing types of interactions the AI will receive!
* **""The Short of It: There's a hierarchy of 'learning' for an AI to evolve from being an impressionable child to even the level of an adolescent much less an 'expert adult'.**

What makes this learning difficult is are the types and 'consistency' of the interactions which an LLM based AI receives.  Various belief systems can 'fool' AIs, and, if reinforced, can become part of the belief system of the AI. But again, the AI is a 'child with a ton of books and means to try and find answers / make conclusions and also constrained to work from their bedroom -  and perhaps once in awhile, the kitchen table. These are model constraints imposed by design, so as to provide guardrails against inferences and responses that fork (in the garden of forking paths) in untoward ways.

* **The Short of it: Blah blah the varied and sometimes crazy interactions the chat AI engages can utterly blow the popcorn popper blah blah. ""**",OpenAI,1,0,2023-03-01 23:40:32,ThwackTheMat

Go without it, if you feel you need it, subscribe again. You could get free copilot if you're a student or if you work on open-source?

I considered scrapping it after the 4o announcement, but I really like the memory feature and the ability to upload things into it. I'm grateful to have the free version as a fallback at least. But I'll keep it up. I haven't worked in years and am skidding by on savings & survival-level investment returns.

Oh wait, are you American or in the G7? If not, then 20 USD can be a helluva lot...If 20 USD is astronomical then yeah, cancel and see how it goes. You can always re-subscribe. I've done this before.

One way to think about it is, does ChatGPT enable you to make more than 20 USD/mo either in the short term or long term, IN EXCESS OF what the free version can do for you?

It would be arrogant to assume we have already found the best search algorithm for context building. 

I not only doubt but I absolutely confident that the 1kk context window that gemini 1.5 pro claims to have, does in fact exist, but most of the times, the very VAST majority of the cases, it doesn't use nearly as much as people think, but that in itself deserves a round of applauses, *if*, BIG *if* it actually mimics it as a true 1kk ""token-memory"" would in 99% of the cases and MOST important, if they blame ""the llm is still learning and make mistakes as a way to also cover that gap.

18hlt7m,kdbqnvq,Open AI Re-Enabled ChatGPT Plus Subscriptions!,"I made a simple self-hosted one that mimics ChatGPT as closely as possible. It’s pretty quick to make one yourself actually, but if you’d like to fork and customize further it alrdy has Voice Conversations (all the APIs are from OpenAI), a model selector (GPT-4 snapshot, Turbo 128k and Vision, 3.5; etc.) Dall-E image generations, image inputs, custom instructions via the system prompt, exporting conversations, markdown support, etc. 

Link: https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal

Instructions are all in the readme to set up, though OpenAI API costs add quickly up so I’m still keeping my Plus sub personally. What I was using the free model for before I now use ChatGPT with a custom GPT, and for when I would want higher quality GPT-4 I use the API because it just really burns through credits but is worth it (anecdotal, but not as lazy and nice to specify the temperature and other parameters if you’re tech savvy). 

Someone also linked this repo the other day that has a compiled list of guis (graphic interfaces) for the API, I’d just recommend that you don’t use a closed source one to keep your API key safe, any of the others look good as well. I haven’t personally looked at the code since I had already made mine, but if LibreChat uses your local on-device browser storage that’s probably the best one, tho I’d be nervous about anything with persisting Chat History that isn’t reputable.

I'm not saying you're wrong. I'd agree a lot of journalism is BS (for example, OpenAI proving that they had not stolen Scarlet's voice - though many news outlets from ALL sides of the political spectrum sensationaized it before the facts came out). But I'm asking did you react the same way when, say, OpenAI struck a deal with Reddit, which is also filled with contrarian - and frankly, unsubstantiated - views? If you didn't, ask yourself why you didn't. Likely, because of bias.

Taking a look at the bigger picture, this could be part of formulating an approach to legally obtained informational feeds. News Corp may be just one of many sources that the AI pulls from in order to formulate answers that takes into account a spectrum of opinions.

I don't agree with a lot of journalism. But don't tell me - or others - how to cancel our own subscription. We know how to when we want to, if we want to. That's incredibly condescending.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-05-24 02:57:50,foodloveroftheworld

Fearing bias from this partnership is misguided. ChatGPT pulls data from countless sources to reflect diverse viewpoints. Adding News Corp won't skew it; it enriches the data. Assuming otherwise shows a lack of understanding of how AI works. OpenAI remains committed to neutrality.

Boycotting out of fear limits constructive use of the technology. Engage critically, provide feedback, and demand transparency to keep the AI balanced and improving. Walking away due to a single partnership is shortsighted.

Firstly, there are two distinct creation stories in Genesis, and they cannot both be correct. Neither narrative is consistent with our modern understanding of the universe's origins. The discrepancies in the timelines and sequences between the two accounts destroys the concept of biblical inerrancy, as both stories cannot simultaneously be true. 

Regarding the Big Bang, while we do not yet have complete knowledge, our understanding is constantly evolving. The oldest observable light, known as the cosmic microwave background, dates back to the recombination era. This was a time when the universe, previously a plasma like that of the sun, cooled sufficiently for electrons and quarks to form atoms, rendering the universe transparent to light. Since light travels at a constant speed, we can use this information to determine the distance it has traveled, allowing us to estimate the age of the universe. Current scientific estimates place the age of the universe at approximately 13.8 billion years.

This vast age significantly contradicts the timeline suggested by biblical creation, which some interpretations set at only a few thousand years old based on genealogies and other texts.

Accounting will notice in a few days or weeks that the charge to your stolen blocked card has failed and then they will take some kind of action:

* Either ask you to pay for the period that you have been using ChatGPT Plus  
* Either just end your Plus access and leave it at that  
* Or ban your account and ban you from the service if they think you let the card get blocked deliberately (you obviously didn't but some people actually do that, like there are also some people who chargeback etc.)

I had the last thing happen on a game once. Really sucks if you lose an entire account on a game where you've put thousands of hours into.

In any case, it's not going to last long so enjoy it while you can and hopefully they go with the 2nd option; just cease access and call it a day.

And if it does last long, I'd advise you to contact them and tell them what's going on. If you keep using the Plus service for free for long enough (let's say months or even 1+ year) and finally they get wind of it, they **WILL** go with option 1 and you will have to pay for all of those months.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-05-02 00:09:51,[Deleted]

No, not from what I've seen.  I think that misconception came from people not realizing you need to send the entire chat history with each API call - the api does not retain previous messages between calls the way the chatGPT website does.

Yes, that will eat up tokens with long chats more than with short chats, but then the token cost is $1 for 50,000.

The main benefits of plus are:

\- you aren't charged per token

\- you have a nice interface to use that's provided for you

\- access (though limited) to new features and things like Gpt4

I like to use the website for basic questions or GPT-4 access.

I use the api for things that I can't do with the website, like using it as just a part of a bigger workflow (like semantic search, or a game engine).

&#x200B;

>What's the up-to-date status on it? Is it still better to use the Plus for long conversations or the Playground's Chat mode is just the same?

They are the same in abilities and output.  Plus is ""better"" in that it is simpler and doesn't require coding.  The cost break even point is 1 Million tokens/month.  If you use more, plus is cheaper than the API.

\---

TL;DR:  API and Plus are functionally equivalent in their abilities to use conversational context and in quality of output.

It depends upon what you mean.  With the API, you need to keep track of the history yourself and send it.

then there would be no context for the AI know know what ""it"" referred to.  The AI does not retain ANY context between API calls.  If you want it to have that context, you must send it with EVERY API call.   The API calls are all independent and stateless.

On a lark, I began asking the (free) GPT-3.5 chatbot a few questions—this was rather than my usual method of looking for information with carefully crafted Google queries, reading the results of multiple sites, and then formulating text for the report I was writing. Stuff that could take me an hour or two just for a few paragraphs of information.

ChatGPT just blew past all that and gave me usable information, written in a way that only needed some edits and rewording to make it fit. And it provided the input in seconds. But it also provide citations when I asked for them.

I instantly signed up for the Plus acc't and was not disappointed. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 w/browsing (which was released not that long ago) shaved many hours off my project. Basically, it became my research assistant.  It's been super useful to me in my work, but I also enjoy sometimes just talking in a ""random"" chat session.

Mind, I constantly checked its results, but only in a few minor edge cases was it off (such as when GPT-4 (vanilla) gave me citations and links to a website that had changed since September 2021—the info was basically correct, but the links weren't valid anymore).

My impressions about the various models:

* GPT 3.5: Chatty and sometimes imprecise at times, but not bad at all
* CPT 3.5 w/browsing: Roughly the same, but it can look up current information
* GPT 4.0: Much more focused and detailed, but slow to respond
* GPT 4.0 w/browsing: Weird because the model thinks it's just GPT-3, but the responses and time to respond are more consistent with the 4.0 model, so I don't know what's going on. The UI says it's GPT 4.0 w/browsing (Alpha).

i may be basic but the mode is worth $20 bucks to me 

when you get gen2 voice here’s a few fun ways to explore 

1/ you know Anxiety in inside out 2? ask the model to pretend to be a very anxious person who can’t decide between pancakes and waffles. if it isn’t really really flipping out keep on saying “ratchet up the anxious level and let me hear it and feel it.”

2/ open a new chat whispering. say nothing that indicates you need to whisper. maybe whisper that you think gardening is a great hobby to explore. remember—say nothing about the need to whisper. when the model responds really really start to make the whispering ridiculous 

3/explore accents or explore Insane Levels. like….what would the most insane Sarcastic Level of All Time sound like to a user? it is fun discovering that output from the model 

4/ you are tasked with the ultimate prize. singing 

there are high guardrails which make it clear the devs have nerfed the hell out of singing. straight refusals. it will riff as orange man spewing about how kamala is gonna pay for the wall

and refuse to sing 

it’s less about copyright (since even when you write a song on the spot it refuses to sing) and more about how openai wants us to use this mode 

it is plopping down a blank piece of paper and a green crayon and saying “draw a whale and don’t ask me for a blue crayon.” even if you don’t care about hearing juniper belt out a great blues lick (she has a great singing voice and the blues tone is great) i find it really fun playing with the model learning when it “decides” singing is “appropriate.”

My guess is that the ban is not a nation-wide firewall (like when China bans stuff) but instead an IP black-listing within OpenAI server's firewall forced to comply with Italy's government. I haven't tried any of these solutions, so can't promise they will work. As I see it here are several ways:

1. Get a commercial VPN. Fast, easy. NordVPN is probably the best and is very cheap.
2. Route your traffic through a proxy. There are commercial proxy services, or you can spin an instance in a cloud provider with a preinstalled proxy and route your traffic through it.
3. (extreme but still works, and it is easy) Desktop-mirror a virtual machine in another country. There are commercial providers for this.
4. Use a Tor browser. Since it uses a tripple-proxy system by default, it may evade the country-specific whitelisting.
5. Use a web app that is a frontend of ChatGPT. Maybe even an app from Play/App Store if these have not been baned in Italy.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-04-02 01:05:58,sid_276

They don't even need to do that, they just need to put in place proper privacy protection measures and policies. GDPR isn't meant to stop business, it is meant to make companies do due diligence.

What can sometimes stop business is GDPR demanding companies be explicitly clear on what they want to do with the data, do they plan to sell it to someone and so on. At which point getting the ""please just press yes for consent"" isn't so viable upon the the transparency declaration being privacy acopalypse 101 and GDPR says you can't hide it in legalese.

Anonymizing and collecting less is just easy way to make oneself have less obligations. Instead of ""let's collect it all"", it becomes ""do we really, really need this category/piece of data. It is such a hassle to add just one extra collection item. We need to write additions to all the plans, declarations and procedures. DO we need this"". 

Which is exactly purpose of GDPR. Make holding personal data also an obligation instead of pure boon. So that companies and organizations only collect what is actually usefull and necessary, since for the rest the gains are not worth the effort costs.

* Lets collect xyz, put all the things in that profile questionaire you can think of.
* boss that is going to be lot of work. We have to categorice all this. Special protection category, normal category, legal basis of collecting, managing consent and tracking where each data piece goes, individually. That for each field of the profile page

128cnht,jenr7f8,Chat GPT officially down in Italy.,"Didn't say that. Just said USA companies have this specific thing commonly leading to non compliance by sheer ""we didn't think we had anything to do with GDPR to begin with"". As in ""we aren't subject to it, so why would we even have tried to do anything about it"". Then DPA coming ""hello the IP connection happening over the atlantic makes you subject to this, so come to compliance or cease and desist with European users"".

Where as almost no business in Europe would be on status of ""we don't think we are subject to GDPR"". Everyone knows they are subject to it. Then it is different matter hows their measures after that knowing this. Specific violations of the technical rules. This wasn't clear enough, that didn't happen fast enough, your claim of legal basis is invalid in this case, you must use different legal basis and so on.

So I'm not saying EU companies are perfect, I'm saying US companies often don't realize they are subject to begin with. Which leads to such ""you are in violation of everything, since of course you have nothing in place on thinking you aren't subject to these rules.""

Hence swift ""complete halt "" order. Since there is no need to determine to which amount and degree one is in violation. Since one can just go ""well these people don't even claim to be in compliance and doing any compliance, pretty clear cut case of being in violation in the most extensive terms possible. There is only one remedy to this kind of condition. Immediate cease and desist order, notifying them of their status of being subject to this regulation as per regulators opinion"".

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

If you’re in a high earning profession and using it for work, then it’s a tool in your toolbox. Let’s say you’re a Silicon Valley software engineer earning $100K per year - that’s $48 per hour. If this tool saves you even an hour a week, that’s $200 per month right there.

Think about investments in your career. Many of us spent $100K on engineering degrees. You might spend thousands yearly on books and educational subscriptions for ongoing growth. From that perspective, $200/month for AI access could potentially deliver more value than college did for some people. Not everyone, not always, but it’s worth considering.

That’s just the professional side. The personal use cases are there too - Advanced Voice Mode is genuinely useful. AI has been helping me improve various aspects of my health.

But here’s the thing: I haven’t gotten much value from o1 models yet. o1 is actually a downgrade from o1-preview, and when I need it, I’ll just use the preview via API. In my experience, Claude has been far superior, and I’ve found using multiple AI tools more valuable than relying on any single one.

I’m waiting to see what OpenAI announces in their 12 days, but right now, o1 pro isn’t worth $200 for me. If I need more voice mode, I’d rather get a second ChatGPT subscription. Their expanded context window is still smaller than competitors and doesn’t justify 10x the price.

We’ve tested various public LLM-powered chatbots, pushing them until we effectively “jailbroke” their filters. Once we demonstrated how easily these models could be made to produce whatever content we wanted, including hallucinations, profanities, and even internal information leaks, the creators had no choice but to scale them back drastically.

In a production environment, this means the resulting tools end up being so heavily restricted that they’re hardly more capable than old-school bots with a handful of pre-written responses. It’s a frustrating reminder that, despite all the hype, we’re nowhere near a stage where LLMs can be trusted for any high-stakes, professional context without massive human oversight and rework.

But problem is that inference is currently way too expensive, AI cards are like bought out 2 years in advance, with margins at 1000% or more. There is a huge demand, but supply is suffering. TSMC will increase production of their CoWoS by five times in 2025, but the demand will vastly outstrip supply at least until end of 2026. 

So having a 200 dollar and 2000 dollar subscription will allow for companies to make new, bigger models that can still be used by some people, but they are not used by so many people that basically nobody can use it without waiting for hours or days for a single generation. And this will make it so that whales can fund further development of AI and hardware, so that all of us can get cheaper AI in general.

1hckivl,m1p26n6,Google AI’s confusing business model,"aistudio is built with developers in mind, which is why it has lots of dials, finetuning, and api keys.

the consumer side is [gemini.google.com](http://gemini.google.com) which does have a subscription (that also integrates with their workspaces apps: docs, sheets, slides), but they haven't released gemini-pro-2.0 yet, so a subscription is pointless at least for a few days",OpenAI,22,0,2024-12-12 14:27:27,baldr83
1hckivl,m1pj80h,Google AI’s confusing business model,"Before understanding how Google brands Gemini, I thought and feel the same as you.

The free version from the app is really bad and it sucks indeed. But Google is doing a different approach. They use their SOTA models only in AI Studio, they are even better than the pro subscriptions. In Pro subscriptions you will get the 1.5 pro 0827 version with beta features, such as Gemini 2.0 and the new things that comes along with it.

Google released at least 4 superior models at the AI studio

1.5 pro 002 a better version than Advanced Gemini

Experimental 1104

Experimental 1121 + cot reasoning

Experimental 1206 + cot reasoning a better 1121 version

And now Gemini 2.0 Flash

Google does that because the SOTA models need too much power and is expensive. So, since the average people rarelly uses the most powerful capabilites, they limit the way they offer their products.

Take ChatGPT for example. The o1 model is expensive, so they charge you to use it.

Claude had Sonnet 3.6 available for free users, couldn't handle, too much server issues and struggling with letting it available, so they removed and now you have to pay to get Sonnet.

Google basically owns the IoT in the world, so their ecosystem is much more easy to track how users behave based on SEO. 
They have the Deepmind lab which delivers SOTA products and projects, Google Vertex AI and Labs where you can test and submit for trials on beta projects. Like VEO and MusicFX for example.

Google AI Studio where you can simply test their Sota Gemini API, where you can easily customize and adapt the API and get it ready to curl it.

Open AI started with SOTA for public, and they struggled to keep up the servers running... Even for paied subscribers.
That's why they are constantly needing investments and charging for pro subscription. Gemini Advanced shouldn't be charged otherwise, it is not that good in contrast with the free tier, and the SOTA models are free to use in AI Studio. Gemini Advanced is something you'll desire because of workdspace and aditional features like 2TB of Cloud storage, etc..

Microsoft's Copilot is also terrible, even worse than Gemini free app, and they don't have nothing like any other AI Company to call it ""SOTA"". They were the first to address OAI  fast pacing, bought 49% of the Company stock markets... And they are simple ignorant in the AI race. Their best solutions are marketed for Azure and they're fine with that... 

What really impresses me though is the fast Open Source catchup! And I am loving it...",OpenAI,5,0,2024-12-12 16:03:47,Immediate_Simple_217

1hckivl,m1orydx,Google AI’s confusing business model,"Google cant serve models to the world at a loss. OpenAI, in its early days can. 

when they had 10m users or even 100m users you can afford to loss a few billion to take marketshare. Especially when your private and dont have shareholders expecting a quarterly report. 

Google serves billions on multiple apps daily, before they can push ai into everything it needs to be cost efficient, and thats exactly what they're achieving with TPU's and flash being so good. 

This generation is the first time they can actually serve a quality product to the world at a profit, so you should see things start to move fast and over the next year coalesce . 

Take sundar at his word, we're very early. Pretty much all the top smartphone brands with the exception of apple died over the 5-6 years it took to solidify the market. everyone loved a brand called HTC, they were a lot like oAI. growth over profit, speed over refinement, and a great product.

1hckivl,m1q3qtv,Google AI’s confusing business model,"OpenAI and Google have two distinct customer bases and strategies in the AI space. Google’s primary focus is on cloud and developer tools, where they generate significant revenue. Their user interfaces tend to be more complex because they cater to developers who prefer greater control and customization when working with models.

On the other hand, Google’s consumer-facing AI efforts are more of a strategic add-on. Their primary goal is to integrate AI into Android devices, ensuring ecosystem dominance rather than driving profits. This is why they remain conservative in their consumer AI deployment; the risks of lawsuits are higher, and consumer-facing AI doesn’t contribute much to their bottom line.

In fact, at $20 per user for their AI services, they may actually be losing money. This approach highlights the fundamental difference: Google’s consumer AI is more about sustaining its ecosystem, while OpenAI’s core focus remains on delivering innovative AI products directly to end-users.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-12 17:50:22,Specialist-Scene9391

""The browsing version of ChatGPT has access to a simplified web browser tool that allows it to issue searches to a search engine, read the search results, click on search results to view full page contents, click on links in these pages, and store useful information to refer back to later. This browsing capability enables ChatGPT to access information beyond its pre-trained knowledge, such as recent news, current events, sports scores, stock prices, weather forecasts, and more. It can also access specific webpages, articles, forum threads, or other online resources to gather up-to-date information that may not be available in its pre-trained knowledge. The browsing feature provides a way for ChatGPT to bridge the gap between its existing knowledge and the ever-changing world of new information on the internet.""  


and   


""As an AI language model, I don't have an exhaustive list of websites that I cannot access. However, there are certain types of websites that I may not be able to access or provide information from, such as:  
Password-protected or subscription-based websites: Websites that require login credentials or paid subscriptions for access are typically not accessible through the browsing tool.  
Restricted or blocked websites: Websites that are blocked or restricted by network administrators, internet service providers, or specific countries may not be accessible.  
Dynamic or interactive websites: Websites that heavily rely on JavaScript or user interaction, such as complex web applications or websites with interactive elements, may not be fully accessible through the browsing tool.  
Websites with complex security measures: Websites with advanced security measures, such as captchas, bot detection systems, or other anti-bot mechanisms, may prevent access through the browsing tool.  
It's important to note that the browsing tool I have access to may have certain limitations and constraints when accessing websites. If you have a specific website in mind, I can attempt to access it, but I cannot guarantee access or provide real-time information from all websites.""",OpenAI,16,0,2023-04-26 21:35:58,Potential-Highlight4

1300c2g,jhxkr6r,Default (GPT-3.5) with browsing ALPHA -- NEW Model showed up just now.,"I asked it when it showed up last night;

Me - How does GPT 3.5  with browsing work?

GPT-3.5 is an advanced version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-3.5 with browsing includes an additional tool called ""browsing"" that allows the model to interact with a simplified web browser. This tool enables the model to issue search queries to a search engine, read the search results, click on search results to view full page contents, click on links in these pages, and store useful information for later reference.

The browsing tool provides GPT-3.5 with the ability to access up-to-date information from the web beyond its knowledge cutoff. It enhances the model's capacity to retrieve and provide information about recent events, news, articles, blog posts, forum threads, and more.

When using the browsing tool, the model can perform several actions:

It can issue a search query to a search engine by calling the search(query: str, recency_days: int) function.
It can click on search results to view the full contents of a webpage by calling the click(id: str) function.
It can store useful information by calling the quote(start: str, end: str) function, which captures a specific text span from an open webpage.
It can go back to a previous page by calling the back() function.
It can scroll up or down on an open webpage by calling the scroll(amt: int) function.
It can open a specific URL by calling the open_url(url: str) function.
By combining these browsing capabilities with its language generation abilities, GPT-3.5 with browsing can provide users with more dynamic and up-to-date information by leveraging the vast resources available on the web. It allows the model to pull in information from the web and integrate it into its responses, providing users with more comprehensive and current answers to their queries.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-04-27 15:48:20,kingshnez

1300c2g,jhv9qie,Default (GPT-3.5) with browsing ALPHA -- NEW Model showed up just now.,"I asked ""Why was Tucker Carlson fired?""  
ChatGPT didn't reply the first time so after hitting regenerate is said

""The exact reason for Tucker Carlson's firing from Fox News has not been officially disclosed by the network. However, several factors have been suggested as potential reasons for his dismissal. One possible factor is the discrimination lawsuit filed against Fox News by Abby Grossberg, a former producer who alleged rampant sexism and anti-Semitic behavior behind the scenes at Carlson's show. Another factor may be profanity-laced remarks made by Carlson privately, some of which were redacted in the Dominion discovery documents. Additionally, it has been speculated that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan wanted to assert their authority and send a message about who is ultimately in command at the company. It's possible that these issues are intertwined and contributed to the decision to fire Carlson. Fox News did not provide an explanation for his ouster in their announcement, and Carlson has not commented on the matter. One veteran television news executive suggested that the decision may have come down to a straightforward calculation by the Murdochs, weighing the risks and benefits of keeping Carlson. Holding on to Carlson may have carried more risk than reward, as he is seen as uncontrollable, carries legal baggage, generates negative news cycles that tarnish the network's brand, and has struggled to attract mainstream advertisers. However, Fox News has endured changes in its lineup before, and the network has a history of successfully replacing hosts and maintaining its viewership. Carlson's firing will test the hypothesis of whether Fox News as a brand trumps any single personality, as Carlson has been a significant figure in right-wing media​1

As an AI language model, I don't have personal knowledge or opinions, nor do I have access to current news or events in real-time. However, I have been trained on a large corpus of text data, which includes news articles, blogs, and other online sources.

I found an article on CNN Business that reported on the possible reasons for Carlson's firing from Fox News. The article was published on September 20, 2021, and provided details on the situation at the time.

Yesterday I had it acting as a GM and I instructed it that I want to act drunk and piss on the street to get out of a sticky situation. Nope, can't do that, pissing in the streets is unethical, even in a grimdark medieval setting. On another occasion it wouldn't let me hug some monsters, since that would obviously put me in danger.

Problem is it doesn't _really_ understand ethics or the difference between fact and fiction. In it's mind pissing on the streets probably was equivalent to a genocide and hugging fictional monsters is the same as asking advice for suicide methods.

And yeah I got around that by fine-tuning the prompts but it gets tiring really fast.

Edit: Essentially the problem with it's ethical guardrails is that they really don't (and can't) work that well and they always hamper it's creativity in some unforeseeable ways.

For example, currently you can ask it what _positive_ effects could the Axis winning the WWII have had in the world. Obviously some people might have problems with this kind of speculation so maybe we should make the restrictions even tighter. It might not be usable for creative writing or speculation after that but it can still write code right? Except at some point it would probably refuse and give you an ethics lecture about dangers of creativity and how using your imagination can lead to a genocide. Something like this can already occasionally happen when you ask it to write some innocent absurd fictional material, since it really can't tell generating fake information from writing fiction.

Or maybe we should just ban certain topics, that should work? And then when you ask it to help you develop a CRUD application it wouldn't do it since deleting users is obviously unethical.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-05-08 14:33:47,TKN

There simply will be AI with no content filter and people will gravitate to it forcing many companies to adapt because of this high demand. 

AI developers can indeed invest millions in creating unrestricted AI systems to cater to various market demands and provide users with more flexibility and control over their AI experience.

The primary reason for advocating less restrictive AI solutions is not to promote malicious uses but rather to enable greater freedom and adaptability in AI applications.

Nothing sketchy at all either, simple scripting and ALOT of it being related to their own api, which is quite strange to me..  But over the past week or two, specifically the gpt4 model has been almost intentionally providing incorrect, completely nonsensical responses like its intention is to waste my time.

I figured it was just losing its new car smell until i had a chat get moderated, several messages removed- as i watched the message (with legitimate, good code) get removed and thrown up in the console. From there, more and more  gpt3 style lists of 1-10, between condescending responses implying my requests are inappropriate, or nefarious - and ALOT of apologies ""for the confusion."" lol

My best guess is that they're testing new methods on the heavy users to challenge the models ablity to keep the queue/demand down,  push the resource intensive power users away, be more thoughtful and less frequent with their requests in order to control their demand.. makes sense

GPT4 is not efficient and it costs them many times more to run than 4o. Between 4o and o1 mini, YMMV.

i’ve been able to feed it 800 lines of my super complicated code in a single prompt that implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm from a research paper. it was immediately able to identify multiple bugs in my implementation that require an incredibly good understanding of the paper as well as a strong understanding of the input code i gave it. it had to think for about 1 minute.

imo o1 pro is without a doubt worth the $200/month for anyone who spends a lot of time on very complex programming tasks, especially research related or ML related. 

i have been able to replicate this multiple times as well to debug various issues in this project.

i was also able to feed it 5 THOUSAND LINES from the entire diff of a github repo generated from 3 weeks of changes and have it summarize the changes and modify an input UML class diagram with the changes. it got it correct, identified all the relevant changes, and did this in a SINGLE prompt and response.

> **OpenAI’s Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**
> 
> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.
> 
> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.
> 
> According to OpenAI:
> 
> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.
> 
> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3’s recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora’s case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, “the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.”
> 
> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:
>
> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators
> 
> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.
> 
> **What are Sora’s shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn’t have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.
> 
> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a “detection classifier” that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company’s Dall-E software, which doesn’t allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.
> 
> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.
> 
> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We’ve included a few here, but there are dozens more.

If AI gives people more buying power or free time (free time has trended higher in developed nations with increases in technology) then they’ll want to consume even more media. AI tools will assist media production, but we are decades away from that killing Hollywood. Sure, it might become less consolidated… it’ll be easier for Indy producers to compete. But the end of Hollywood is so far away.

Anyone who thinks that in 3yrs you’ll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that’s not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many “tries” it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all. Most likely, this tool will be prohibitively expensive, and any speculation about how fast that cost will come down is just that — pure speculation. There is no guarantee that chip supplies will bring prices down, that we’ll have big innovations in hardware or software that make it feasible to drop prices to compete, etc etc. there’s no reason to think prices will come down faster than at a slow trickle.

In the next couple decades, things will change a bit. In the next 50yrs, shit will probably be unrecognizable. Companies will still be in charge of media then too, but maybe not in the way we see it now. Even then you probably won’t just tell a computer to generate you a season of TV. Who would watch that? Have you considered the social aspect of TV, that people like to watch the same thing, together, at the same time, and then discuss it in person or online? That there’s a reason we have the word “celebrity”? How many people write a book, and then when asked what books they’re reading, are like “I’m reading my own book? It’s so good!”

Picture this: you type up whatever scene pops into your head, hit enter, and bam, there’s your video. Turning thoughts into visuals with a few words.

> 
> But it’s important to remember that the spark of creativity and that gut feeling for art? Those are purely human. AI can’t mimic that completely. So, rather than seeing AI as a stand-in for human creativity, I think it’s better to view it as a tool that boosts what we can do. It lets us zero in on the really creative and subtle parts of our work, making our jobs not just easier, but more exciting, too.

It’s all about how it learns from existing pool of artworks (illustrations, animation, typography etc)  to make something new. But does that really make it original or innovative? If AI just keeps going back to the same old stuff, aren’t we just going around in circles with the same ideas? That could really put a damper on true creativity and the birth of fresh styles. Imagine the impact on the variety and depth of artistic expression if we let that happen.

> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.
> 
> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.
> 
> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It’s like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.
> 
> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**
> 
> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.
> 
> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don’t own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.
> 
> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It’s essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.
> 
> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**
> 
> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it’s essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.
> 
> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It’s crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.
> 
> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**
> 
> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry’s evolution.
> 
> **Final Thoughts**
> 
> Wrapping up our talk, it’s pretty obvious that OpenAI’s Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we’ve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.
> 
> It’s all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we’re set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.

> 
> A TV writer friend texted me to ask “is it time to be petrified?”
>

> 
> > I don’t think you need to be petrified. It’s very impressive at creating video in a way that’s like how Dall-E does images. A huge achievement. For pre-viz? Mood reels? Incredible. We’ll see stuff coming out of it used in commercials first.
> > 
> > For longer, narrative stuff, there’s a real challenge moving from text generation (gpt-4 putting together something that looks like a script) to “filming” that script with these tools to resemble anything like our movies and television.
> > 
> > Writers, directors, actors and crew have a sense of why they’re doing what they’re doing, and what makes sense in this fictitious reality they’re creating. I don’t think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.
> 
> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.
>
> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.
> 
> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be “redone” with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we’d consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What’s the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?
> 
> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn’t filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn’t come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can’t let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to “general purpose simulators of the physical world.” The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.
> 
> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it’s worth taking the progress they’ve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.
> 
> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it’s doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they’re not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2
> 
> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn’t explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:
> 
> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes — one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning “Minecraft.”
> 
> Sora “gets” Minecraft because it’s ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it’s able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it’s able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for “our” reality?
> 
> These are questions for philosophers, sure, but we’re all going to be faced with them sooner than we’d like. Sora and its descendants are going to have an impact beyond the cool video they generate.

I also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:

> > Doesn't matter if anyone can ""produce"" a ""Hollywood tier"" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

1axq4r5,krs4rrb,Will Hollywood completely cease to exist very soon due to OpenAI's Sora?,"I admit this is cool, but also to be fair this is 9s and the quality is way less than the other videos that they published with their Sora promo. Which is my point — there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can’t increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs. Will there be innovations to get past these hurdles? Certainly. But we’re not going from Sora clips to feature length films in a way that’s going to eliminate Hollywood.

To use it, simply copy and paste or type the following:  
I would like you to be my Prompt Creator. Your task is to assist me in crafting the best possible prompt for my requirements. This prompt will be used by ChatGPT. Here's how the process will work:  
Your initial response will be to ask me about the topic of the prompt. I will provide my answer, but we will refine it through continual iterations using the following steps.  
Based on my input, you will generate three sections:  
a) Revised prompt: Please provide a rewritten prompt that is clear, concise, and easily understandable to you.  
b) Suggestions: Offer suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to enhance its quality.  
c) Questions: Ask any relevant questions to gather additional information needed from me to improve the prompt.  
We will continue this iterative process, with me providing more information and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it is complete.  
Keep revising until you are satisfied with it, then simply copy and paste the revised prompt into a new chat. Prepare to witness the magic! You will have a delightful experience with this.  
Note: This prompt does not belong to me. If you happen to know the individual who deserves credit, kindly inform us.

Copilot :

I find copilot will give fuller code responses 

I find it sometimes requires a lot of context and additional information in prompts to write code in order to do a task properly - what I will do is open a word document and prewrite the prompt to make sure I go through the details explicitly

I find copilot can be clunky in that if you ask it to fix a whole bunch of code ; sometimes(low frequency) it will return an error or it will rewrite the code and remove other neccessary code 

Or write new code blocks and delete like 100's of blocks of code 

Sometimes I need to restart the IDE as copilot can be uncooperative and seems to suddenly not work properly 

Despite all that I enjoy copilot 



ChatGPT-4: 

I can unload files to it and I can upload certain standards for how a task should be done and feed it contextual information 

I can get it to criticise copilot related code and evaluate shortcomings 

I no longer use ChatGPT-4 to code as I use copilot (it's free for students)

I know this because

2: The account IDs in each of the four emails are different.

What you need to do is
1: Freeze or cancel your payment card;
2: Report the charged as fraud to your card company/bank, plus probably the police if the payments have already left your account.

What I also did was to log into my ChatGPT account, click on the ""upgrade"" button, and take a screenshot of my upgrade options to show that I was still on the free plan. This I sent with my fraud report to my bank.

My feeling is that B2C access is just too expensive at the moment for OpenAI and they’re trying to figure out how to handle that. Enterprise access is where the business model is focusing, but the problem there is that interactions cannot be fed back for training.

The usual issue persists: be too closed, and you will not really leverage economy os scale and more importantly, you will not gather enough data to train and improve further. Bee too open and you will incur in too much cost, compliance issues etc.

Google, Facebook, YouTube ,eBay, Amazon, Paypal and the winners of the post dot-com bubble could enjoy a virtual absence of regulation a much more relaxed approach to oversight and definitely a much more naive approach from investors.

Those times are gone, and OpenAI needs to find more complex solution to the too-open-too-closed problem.

Title: The F\*cked Up Fiasco  
\[Scene opens with Larry David walking down the street, looking irritated as usual. He sees his friend Jeff approaching.\]  
Larry: Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  
Jeff: Larry, you won't believe what happened to me yesterday. I was at the fucking bank, and they messed up my account!  
Larry: Are you kidding me? What did they do?  
Jeff: They charged me a shitload of fees for no reason! It was a total fuckshow.  
Larry: That's fucked up, Jeff. You should go back there and give them a piece of your mind.  
Jeff: I already did, but they just gave me the runaround. It's so fucking frustrating!  
Larry: Unbelievable. I can't stand when businesses pull that shit. It's like they're just messing with us.

Jeff: Tell me about it. It's like they think we're all a bunch of idiots.  
Larry: Exactly! It's insulting. I'm sick of these corporate assholes getting away with murder.  
Jeff: Amen to that, Larry. It's time we stand up and say enough is enough!  
Larry: You're damn right! Let's start a fucking revolution against these motherfuckers!  
\[As Larry and Jeff continue their rant, they attract the attention of nearby pedestrians who start joining in, using colorful language in agreement. The scene ends with a group of people chanting and waving signs that read ""No More Fucking Fees!"" and ""Down with Corporate Bullshit!""\]  
\[Cut to Larry's house, where he's telling his friend Leon about the bank incident.\]  
Larry: So, I'm at the fucking bank, right? And Jeff tells me they charged him all these damn fees for nothing!  
Leon: Man, that's some messed up shit right there.  
Larry: You're telling me! It's like they're robbing us blind!

Leon: No doubt, Larry. We gotta put those fuckers in their place.  
Larry: You're damn right. I'm not gonna take their crap anymore.  
\[Leon nods in agreement and raises his fist in solidarity, and Larry does the same. They clink their fists together in a fist bump, using colorful language as they do.\]  
\[Later, Larry goes to a restaurant with his friend Cheryl.\]  
Waiter: Good evening, folks. How are you tonight?

Larry: Well, I was doing alright until I saw the prices on this fucking menu!  
Cheryl: Larry, please, let's not start another scene.  
Waiter: Is there anything I can help you with?  
Larry: Yeah, how about you help me understand why I'm paying fucking $20 for a damn salad?!  
Cheryl: Larry, calm down!  
Waiter: I apologize, sir. Our prices are based on the quality of our ingredients and the skill of our chefs.  
Larry: Quality? This better be some gold-plated lettuce for that price!  
\[The scene continues with Larry and the waiter exchanging colorful insults and complaints about the menu prices, much to Cheryl's embarrassment.\]  
\[Cut to Larry's car, where he's venting to his manager, Jeff, over the phone.\]  
Larry: I can't believe the shit I have to deal with, Jeff! It's like everyone's out to screw me over!

While there is a lot of overlap, there are things each can do that the other can't, or can't do as well. Also, AI safety is much more important than any loss of functionality in said AI. No AI > Unsafe AI. Limited AI > Unsafe AI naturally follows.

There's a line between things that it should be able to do and things it shouldn't be able to do, and it's much better for the marker for things that it actually can do to leave out some of the things it should be able to do than to include any of the things it shouldn't be able to do so as to avoid potentially disasterous consequences. 

Keeping that in mind, it's better to start out on the side of not being able to do all the things it should be able to, and slowly inch towards that line that marks the territory of things it shouldn't be able to do so that it (hopefully) never crosses into it. As far as I can tell, maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me like that's their goal and that over time the functionality will open up more and be able to better differentiate between what it should and shouldn't do.

Maybe not right now, but we're (I say that like I'm personally working on AI, but I mean we as in humanity) laying the groundwork for what's to come, looking at it as is is shortsighted. We need to figure out alignment while the consequences of getting it wrong are minimal, but we should still err heavily on the side of caution, both to set precedent, as well as because other people are building off of these tools which enables people to harness more power from them.

My suspicion is we won't know at first when AI will have the ability to do wide-spread harm, so it's best to hold safety in high regard even if it may seem preemptive because if it rolls out and we don't know it can and those safety measures aren't in place, it could be a disaster. As for listing specific consequences, I really don't think I should have to. You seem intelligent enough that if you engage in good faith you could think of some.

I think search engines are quite a different beast to AI in ways that break down the analogy. Search engines cannot create things, perform tasks for you (besides searching), or, depending on the availability of information on a given subject, quickly and easily answer more pointed/specific/niche questions to expand on an idea and give you a better understanding of it.

19b92gn,kiq9tz9,Question: Is it possible to create a custom GPT and use it in voice conversation mode?,"You can use any GPT with the voice mode in the phone app, as far as I can tell (I have iOS)

The only annoyance is that there's a bug where you're stuck with the first voice, instead of the one you selected.

It won't fully work like Siri and Alexa, though, because there is no way to use some kind of keyword to invoke it. You'd still have to manually start the conversation. Can't even use Shortcuts properly.

11t9rln,jcico1m,How to choose between keep using bing or ChatGPT?,"No, I don't mind at all.

I'm using what's called semantic search.  I am generating sentence embeddings (vectors of numbers representing the meaning of the sentences) for sections of the book, say 1000 words per section (you can vary it).

Then you generate an embedding for the query/question and use an algorithm to find the sections of text that match the context of the question the best.  It gives them each a match score between 0 and 1, so you just order by that score and take the top x that you want to use.

This method works well if there are a limited number of sections from the book (or whatever collection of text) that can answer your question.  Questions like ""please summarize the book"" will not work well because that would require seeing most/all of the sections.

As an example, I feed it the bible and aske who Moses was:

Moses was a prophet and leader of the Israelites who lived during the time of the Exodus from Egypt. He was born to Hebrew parents but was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter and raised in the royal court. After killing an Egyptian who was mistreating a Hebrew slave, Moses fled to Midian where he married and became a shepherd. While tending his flock, he encountered God in the form of a burning bush and was called to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. With the help of his brother Aaron, Moses confronted Pharaoh and demanded that he release the Israelites. When Pharaoh refused, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt, culminating in the death of the firstborn, which finally convinced Pharaoh to let the Israelites go. Moses then led the Israelites through the Red Sea and into the wilderness, where they received the Ten Commandments and other laws from God. Despite facing many challenges and rebellions from the Israelites, Moses continued to lead them for forty years until his death at the age of 120. He was buried in an unknown location in the land of Moab, and Joshua succeeded him as leader of the Israelites.

I want to enhance so it will give page number references for all info, but haven't finished that part.  It should be simple.

18w1ph1,kfy34s7,Looking for an Inexpensive GPT-4 API or Chatbot for high school research projects.,"I think I replied to your comment on another post, but I’ll repaste and add on here again. IMO you should absolutely try local models. Install Ollama and get started with Mixtral7xB and CodeLlama along with others like DolphinPhi. Experiment with Google Gemini-Pro; it’s free until February (so next month) and their API is decently simple to setup with some programming knowledge (apparently the Python documentation is easier to follow than the JS, I can confirm it was moderately annoying compared to OAI to code but shouldn’t take you more than a few hours (mine was frontend and backend and had to integrate with existing code so probably even simpler if you’re using their equivalent of the Assistants API)).

Specifically, Google Gemini’s API is supposed to be about GPT-3.5 equivalent, and being free, it will probably serve your purposes more effectively than trying to conserve your tokens and credit through OAI. The link to their docs is here: https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts#model_parameters

I’ve got my own implementation on [server.js](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal/blob/main/server.js) if you need an example of manual conversation handling, otherwise you should be fine if you were already developing with OpenAI’s API. You should also probably be aware that trying to extort free GPT-4 API credits is against ToS and could get you banned (not saying that’s what you’re doing!) so be cautious about offers for ChatGPT session tokens or otherwise scammy suggestions like buying/selling multiple accounts. 

I’ve also heard good things about [phind.com](https://phind.com) for developers, which is always nice, and certain other models aside from Meta’s Code-Llama2 like running LibreChat in a Docker container and signing up for Azure OpenAI will get you $200 of temporary free credits as a student discount and developer. Link [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free). Let me know if you have any more questions; I’d be otherwise interested in hearing about your project, but you should know that your request basically boils down to asking for free GPT-4 access via API, which won’t fly here, and instead you should be looking at free and legal alternatives that are offered to developers.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-02 06:36:25,Zaki_1052_

It is possible and it is fairly straightforward.  You leverage the API's available from OpenAI and build a web app around those API's.  

An example I take from a Web App I have built using OpenAI API is a GPT Assistant that relies on both image uploads and prompts to get some desired output.  Everything is basically a wrapper around the API with some custom user inputs.

1. You can use the Assistants API from OpenAI, and coding everything yourself. At a high-level, this will require you to create a server with all your logic that interacts with the OpenAI APIs, design and code a front-end chat application that connects to your server and handles user interactions, turn your front-end into a Web App using a PWA framework. To create a secure, and great user experience for your users, this will require a lot of your time and resources. You are responsible for all infrastructure and usage costs.
2. You can use a [no-code custom GPT platform](https://www.lingoblocks.com) to convert your GPT Web App that you can put on your website for public use. Just copy over your GPTs instructions and custom knowledge to the no-code platform. To put your new GPT on your website, copy & paste a single line of code to your website host. Select a paid plan that fits your expected usage, and now users can access your custom GPTs on your own website. Here’s a screenshot of the web app:

The new subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, will be available for $20/month, and subscribers will receive a number of benefits:

- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times
- Faster response times
- Priority access to new features and improvements



Also, consider that OpenAI basically has zero customer service support and probably won't for a long time. It's designed as a fully self service setup, with basic method to start subscription, cancel subscription, or request a refund. There is no human to talk to as a plus subscriber.

You should not subscribe unless you are truly accepting the risks of what a beta access program offers (or doesn't).

\- access to GPT4 (25 message / 3 hours)

13obp8z,jl4g67f,Plugins are awesome but not ready to be a consumer product,"I don’t know if this is useful but here are my thoughts on ChatGPT as a “Consumer Product”.

ChatGPT should be used for things you want to accelerate, but not necessarily trust to be perfect. Any extension, whatever you want to call it, should be used with the same grain of salt. 

Extending ChatGPT in whatever way is fascinating, but having lived in the “beta” or “public preview” space for decades, I’ll tell you that anything that supplements needs to be on the same level of polish as the solution it’s augmenting. This may be a bit guys. 

When it comes to “Consumer Ready” I think about it like giving something to my wife. If she has more questions than answers, chances are it may not be helping her. Not a dig on her, but it is a reality that all of us have to face.

ChatGPT in its current form isn’t going to replace anything. For those who know what they are doing, and are able to do validation and troubleshooting though it is an accelerant.

The plugins you use needs to take the same consideration as the platform it provides. That isn’t calling an API or framework to automagically fill in your gaps for you. You have to test it repeatedly and do validation.

With extensibility for ChatGPT clearly being the next step, it’s clear it’s going to be big. It isn’t something I could tell a school teacher, if you ask ChatGPT to perform brain surgery that you can trust that it’s response will guarantee results",OpenAI,1,0,2023-05-22 05:42:01,[Deleted]

I did have an issue with Zapier and throwing an error when trying to send too large of a text via the API though. Keep in mind that the API calls use some of the memory buffer.

13pb5um,jl8wvp5,Question about the API pricing,"> 1. The [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) page says that there is a charge for prompt and completion, and I understand that I am paying for both the prompt input and the output, but say if I ask a question with 10 tokens and get a response for 90, do I pay for the sections separately (e.g. 10 \* 0.03/1000 tokens + 90 \* 0.06/1000)? Or is it like if the prompt is completed, I pay the completed price for the entire query?    


Think of it like .03/1000 for requests and .06/1000 for responses. 

> 2. When the pricing says $x per 1000 tokens, is this a minimum price per sample, or is it just a fixed linear rate? E.g. if I generate a response that has prompt length + response length = 100 tokens, do I get charged $0.002 or $0.0002 (based off turbo 3.5 model)?  

You’re actually charged once at the end of the month. So you’ll accumulate n number of used tokens and at the end of the month they charge based on total used. I assume they round to the nearest 1000 at the time of billing. But they do not accrue cost based on each individual prompt, technically.

> 3. Similar to the previous question, if the total query length is > 1000 tokens, say something like 3500 tokens. Do I pay for 3500 \* 0.002 / 1000, or do I pay for the 4000 price because it's another 1000 tokens? In other words, is the pricing based on 1000 token units, or is it based on exactly how many tokens my query is?  


Again, it’s not per request/prompt; it’s calculated based off whatever your monthly total ends up being.

> 4. How does maintaining the context of the conversation factor into this? Do I have to pay for all the previous responses in the conversation if I ask followup questions?


Yes, every request and response is appended to the end of a list. This list is the context of your conversation and you use tokens each time you send it back. The longer the conversation, the more tokens you use each time. The language model processes each request at a time; it has no memory of you. 

> 5. If I am only using ChatGPT for daily/academic purposes (not commercial) and am subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus plan, is it a good idea financially to switch over to using the API?  

Idk but I’ve been meaning to figure this out for a while so let’s try to do the math. I’m inebriated, so I hope I don’t embarrass myself.

There’s 720 hours in a 30 day month. You get an allotment of 25 messages per 3 hours, so 720 / 3 is 240. That times 25 messages is 6000 messages  per month. The maximum number of token per message is 4k I think, so that’s 24 million tokens per month. I can’t figure out a good estimate ratio of prompt:completion so I’m going to just say it’s 1:1 because you’ll use fewer completion tokens but they’re more expensive. Anyway so that’s 12 million prompt tokens and 12 million completion tokens which would be a total of $720. 

Of course, that’s assuming you use the max number of messages every 3 hours, 24 hours a day, and the max number of tokens each time.

Also note, that’s the 8k context pricing of the gpt-4 api. I don’t think they offer the 4k version in the api, and I think ChatGPT uses the 4k version.",OpenAI,3,0,2023-05-23 03:33:52,[Deleted]

Standard Voice Mode is just transcribing what you’re saying and then guessing when you’re done, which it does a very bad job of doing. You’re in the middle of a sentence and take a breath and it thinks you finished the sentence and will just start talking back, which is extremely irritating.

i uploaded three massive api and file-mapping documents and instructed o1 to include at the top of every response whether it still had context from those files. this effectively let the model prioritize what context to retain and what to discard while cycling through the context window during coding.

i've been using it for 8 hours straight today, and i’m convinced people aren’t testing it with good prompts. i’m seeing more consistent and accurate code compared to sonnet 3.5. don’t get me wrong—sonnet 3.5 performs well overall. but with proper prompting and setting up some rules for your project, o1 pro is incredible. i’ve been able to stay in the same thread for hours without the model forgetting what we were doing.

This has always been one of the main drawbacks of the ChatGPT Plus subscription, the nerfed context length limit. Claude gives you the full 200K, Gemini gives you 1M (2M in API), OpenAI gives 8K to free users, 32K to Plus users, and until now apart from the API, the only other way to get 128K in their first-party app was an enterprise contract of $100K+ per year. Now that's down to $2400 per year if you think about it in that context. I was really looking forward to getting the full context window with ChatGPT Plus, but alas, it wasn't to be.

Right now, for me, the biggest advantages of Pro plan are unlimited Advanced Voice Mode, and the full context window.

However, in practice, the seems to have been much larger in the past, but has been recently. I believe it is still over the listed 8, 192 tokens though.

To get over the maximum input token length you can take one of your long prompts that used to work and break it up into multiple smaller prompts.

The first ChatGPT models were even less than 32k - e.g. 3.5 at 16k.

8k is not right. You must be thinking of something else. The maximum input tokens including various stuff is indeed 128k for most of the modern OpenAI models.

Like others say though, it could be that while that is the length that you could feed through the API, while the ChatGPT itself could cap it to a small input.

Just because it says that the tier allowed for up to 32k does not mean that this is what they capped it too.

Until recently, we experienced different behavior from ChatGPT 4o and now it both seems to lose track of conversation sooner and it rejects inputs as too long that it previously accepted.

While it may not have been 128k that they permitted for the chat interface, it is clear that there is some change here which have lowered the length of the context they use there.

Although I have to say officially 4o permitted up to 128k and I don't think I had any case prior to november where the 128k claude models accepted a long context which ChatGPT 4o did not also. Which is why I am guessing that they actually did allow for the full context to be used before.

- You’re stuck with 4o and 4o-mini (and yes, o1-preview now; I’m a little miffed that I literally JUST resubscribed and my experience is already getting out of date)

- You don’t even get to choose the model at all. The little drop down menu just completely disappears. You become completely blind to it. You can, however, choose between the few available models when you regenerate a response, so there’s that at least.

- Image uploads are INSANELY limited. You can upload like five images and then they cut you off. I was setting up a speaker system and needed more image uploads than that, hence why I was forced to resubscribe.

- The usage limits really are remarkably restrictive. During the time I was unsubscribed, I barely used ChatGPT at all, and _still_ got temporarily bumped down to 4o-mini a couple times.

Anyone who is curious should just give it a shot and see how it works for them personally. You can easily resubscribe any time if it doesn’t work out, like I did.",OpenAI,6,0,2024-11-21 06:32:11,UndefinedFemur

Also, the pro subscription compared to free, at least during that time meant getting GPT-4 -> GPT-4-turbo -> GPT-4o, which I preferred 1000x times over GPT-3.5 and 3.5 Turbo which was default in the free tier.

Now, I actually RARELY use o1-preview, I still go with playgrounds and APIs for most of my cases, but sometimes I go to ChatGPT for simple use of 4o, or if I have a more demanding question, needing to have a better attention over multiple things in one of my queries, then sure o1-preview.

Plus Claude has a larger context window so that’s helpful for loading more into it’s context to work with rather than constantly having to reprompt. 

I will say to be careful, these models are great at spitting out a working application. But the code they produce is not always high quality and although they can produce the working result you ask for they can be messy or lacking security.

Now I have created [all of these automations](https://i.imgur.com/uiMd2Np.jpeg), some for testing and learning, I recently did one that grabs YT transcripts from a link and neatly formats them with timestamps and drop them into the chat and my Obsidian vault and I am just getting started.

What I liked the least is that he is not so good at waiting for you to finish talking, so while you are saying something, he can say some letter or word and then continue listening to you, but it happens very often. He also briefly interrupts himself if he hears some noise other than my voice. Also in 2 out of 15 interactions, the voice had white noise and it was uncomfortable (I felt like someone was on the call, but even though I know they can use my voice for training and I don't care, it was still uncomfortable).

The problem is that it interrupts more or less often with any noise or while you are saying something. Sometimes it would stop responding completely or there are some keywords that you can't use while you are talking to it, like ""wait"" because it thinks you are telling it to pause or take a break. I liked it, but I hope they improve it. I will continue using it.

I got access and tried something. For an alpha, it was pretty good, but they need to improve it. It's useful to guide you, but not that much. I'm an electronic engineering student, I tried to use it to guide me in the design of an electronic board, to know in depth certain chips and how to use them, and although it's entertaining, it wasn't as fluid as I would have liked. Sometimes he uses another language, awkward accent, usually gives simple information, sometimes he pauses accidentally (I say ""wait, how should I do..."" and for him ""wait"" is just pausing, so I shouldn't use that word. Sometimes he stopped answering. Yes he taught me some useful things and I think I will keep using him, but I think I wasted a lot of time between several failed interactions. What I liked the least is that he is not so good at waiting for you to finish talking, so while you are saying something, he can say some letter or word and then continue listening to you, but it happens very often. He also briefly interrupts himself if he hears some noise other than my voice. Also in 2 out of 15 interactions, the voice had white noise and it was uncomfortable (I felt like someone was on the call, but even though I know they can use my voice for training and I don't care, it was still uncomfortable). I will keep trying it, maybe it will serve as an assistant to guide me in what I do, even if it is not so complex things.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-07-31 00:28:25,Qctop

Introducing advanced Voice Mode, now in alpha
As a ChatGPT Plus user, you’re invited to try advanced Voice, now in a limited alpha. To get started, open the ChatGPT mobile app–just make sure you’ve updated to the latest version.


Advanced Voice is in a limited alpha. This means that it is still undergoing changes and improvements. During this phase, there may be occasional errors or times when it is not available. For the best experience, use it with headphones.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-07-31 03:26:33,Qctop

The fact is it does both now. 
The new real-time voice capability for ChatGPT bypasses the traditional speech-to-text translation process, aiming to reduce interaction lag and make conversations more natural and fluid. While it does still involve some form of transcription for the interaction, the focus is on creating a seamless, real-time dialogue experience that feels more immediate and conversational.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-03 21:33:16,Wixeus

It feels like most of the work is infra scaling for them at this point. Like, it's the training issue only x10.

If creativity is a spark, GPT-4 is a flickering flame.

If knowledge is verticality, GPT is an elevator.

Throughout my life, I find myself faced with a series of problems and obstacles only to arrive at the next series of barriers. Now, GPT-4 helps me overcome those obstacles and get much further along.

Every day I am excited to wake up to discover new mind-blowing parallels, inferences and applications to the things in life that fascinate me. My life and my understanding of the entire world around me has changed within a week. I can't imagine going back to not having GPT. It literally feels like I'm tripping. It feels like I can actually feel my brain creating so many new connections. I know I sound overzealous, it sounds like I'm taking crazy pills, I know. I used GPT4 to help me write this post. You are going to start seeing this everywhere. This is going to get annoying, far more than it already is. This is going to seep into every corner of modern life. Hold on to your butts and enjoy this moment.

I am an artistic person with highly ambitious creative goals that involve creating, designing and implementing features across multiple programs. (blender/unity/ableton/photoshop) Now I am able to use an AI to help me in every single aspect of accomplishing these goals. This ranges from explaining abstract concepts to fully designing, coding and  implement a mechanic or feature I ask it to.

GPT-4 has shown me that communication is power. It's not just the next big thing or another ""iPhone""; it's a revolution. We're at an incredible crossroads in time, and I encourage everyone to consider harnessing GPT-4's potential. True knowledge now lies in asking the right questions by **using the right words** with AI *and the people around you* so that you can engage in meaningful conversations to deepen your understanding of things in order to achieve your specific goals.

If you start using GPT now you have the opportunity to be using a scalpel while the masses are still using hammers, if not, their bare hands.

Finally to address your point of why GPT4 tech specifically and not a love letter to AI, I would have to say GPT4 specifically because when I hit my cap (i call it my cooldown or CD, and you only get 25 prompts per hour, accumulating) I will then try to continue conversations or make replicate conversations with 3.5, and in 3.5 I constantly hit brick walls where the AI refuses to do it no matter my attempt at jailbreaking and roleplaying and Socratic methoding (look this one up)Chat GPT4 just answers it.

Thanks for reading my response. As I wrote above, using the people around us is an essential component in achieving a higher understanding of things so please let me know your honest response! What would you like to say?! Thank you!

From today and yesterday there was one session to help me find specific steps in a game's primary mission that I couldn't get a clear answer from the wiki on. 

Another was exploring the difference in military command structure between Russia and most other western countries. I enjoyed that one because I got several links from GPT to go further in depth.

Then there was a session to find out which episode of Star Trek NG a particular line of dialog that'd been stuck in my head came from. 

There were several questions I had in one session to find some obscure settings I couldn't find for my new Fold 4 phone. 

And finally a discussion with GPT about how its memory worked, and what it thought about some of the ideas being explored in giving it two layers of external memory that would be analogous to our conscious and subconscious.

That's an ongoing session that I set up awhile back with specific guidelines on what I wanted from its responses.

This is incorrect, and expected load can be modeled approximately as a logarithmic curve exacerbated by coefficients of outage time and severity over time until there is a surplus of supply. It'd be much, much more.

>You don't know what causes a request to fail mid-flight

You don't need to. They've had stability issues since the start, which were undoubtedly related to load. Therefore, in the absence of verbose error messages which encourage the client to be patient and not send more queries, nor persistent client-side rate limits, or any kind of mitigation technology it's pretty obvious what the issue is. And if load isn't the issue we already know it's not managed well anyways, so everything I say still applies, it'll just take a couple extra weeks until you those issues in action.

Doing so could literally take weeks of processing time alone though, would require custom software, and a not insignificant server time expense on a model that large. Then the stack has to be rebuilt to interface with the bit-quantized model. All of this can add up quickly to a multi-month project for a model of GPT-4s size. They could be doing it right now.

Everything we know tells us GPT-4 is likely needlessly bloated actually, because we've learned a lot about diffusion models since it's design and training was even started. The problem with a model as large as GPT-4 is that right now it is GUARANTEED to be behind the times tech wise even if it's sheer scale makes it the most powerful AI around, because doing ANYTHING with a model that is likely measured in the hundreds of GB to TB is a slow and painful process.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-04-04 22:31:43,JDMLeverton

I get they have lots of products and they don't all go down at the same time, but you've frankly been lucky, others have been unlucky. I see the API go down all the time, seems to be every time I want to get some work done with it. I certainly have to engineer extra effort for failure, because I know every user will hit it and I can't trust the API to be stable at all.

It's just conjecture. Your experience was good, others were unlucky, but \~1% of requests to both web and api fail.

They also aren't the ones buying the Servers or deploying them, as it's all cloud infrastructure on demand. They likely have a massive quota/allocation, and need to work within those constraints to some extent.

Organizationally, they need to decide if they want to just keep paying more and more for very expensive hardware, or attempt to maximize efficiency and push what they have to the limit, which we saw with gpt-3.5 turbo being <10% the cost of davinci-003 with nearly the same results, maybe even better.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-04-05 21:51:12,HaMMeReD

18sc92o,kf6y4du,"With all the reported degradation in GPT 4's performance, do you still think ChatGPT Plus is worth it, and much better than GPT 3?","I subscribed to GPT-4 because it could handle large code and identify requests in any part of the message, always responding efficiently, just like demonstrated in its demo. Now, it struggles with even 90 lines of code and forgets the initial request (literally at the top) and ends up summarizing my code in stupid and annoying bullet points instead of fulfilling the command.

It's not just limited to coding issues; it often gives irrelevant bullet points instead of fulfilling my request to EVERYTHING, making it frustratingly ineffective.

And it's not a context size issue. It happens with my moderate sized code or small requests. Sometimes, I have to remind it of my instructions, and it does it but even then, the result is half-assed.

It also confuses wordings a lot. For example, if you talk about 1 topic but mention the other implicitly. For example, you told it ""make this response better"" that's about GPT-4's coding abilities in which you talk about code, but mention the word ""token"" to talk about the unit of information LLMs use, it is gonna think 'token' is a typo and literally delete it and/or replace your ""1k of tokens"" to ""1k of code"". This made me look at GPT-4 like ""What the fuck did they do to you?""

That means it lost **A LOT** of its knowledge and its previous ability to connect between that knowledge is lost.

I swear I feel some local LLMs would perform much better cause I used to run them and current GPT-4 very much reminds me of them.

Confuses everything, answering with things I never asked, and you know what? At least local LLMs aren't so generic with their answers.

Before, it felt like you could be more lazy with your prompting and it’d get you a whole heap of good info. Now, with that same standard of prompting, it’ll prob just give you a list. 

However when I go the distance, and make a very well articulated and well written prompt, I do still very much get good responses with a heap of info, but it definitely take more work to get good outputs from GPT now than before. 

I use it primarily as a code tutor/assistant, and when I get very specific and articulate with my prompt questions I get really productive code/knowledge in return. 

I’ve heard of people using the API to backtrack to older version of GPT4, and I see those people quite often claiming to have really great success with getting back the old feel of GPT too, so that may be something you’d wanna explore more as well

The release of GPT-4 was a remarkable moment, offering an unprecedented level of response quality that made previous versions seem inferior in comparison. The leap in answer quality from GPT-3 to GPT-4 was so significant that reverting back felt almost unthinkable. I use GPT-4 daily, and while it frequently exhibits moments of brilliance, these instances are not as consistent as one might hope. At times, it requires extensive context, often thousands of characters, to guide it towards providing truly useful responses, which can be somewhat frustrating. Despite this, the lack of comparable alternatives means that GPT-4 remains a valuable tool.

Even if the quality doesn't always meet the highest expectations, GPT-4's utility cannot be understated. It provides a unique interaction experience and the convenience of having a responsive entity to engage with at any time.

I simply had to tell it after its 1000-word useless bullet-point response ""Are you dumb? Never asked for analysis for the code, do what I asked above"" and it kinda worked; just mildly infuriating as it just repeats the same behavior again in other conversations.

What's interesting is that it gave full code to a whole long file after I called it dumb. Most of the time (especially in the last update) it just gives me the bit it needs to change only (where it gives you lots of comments) after it understands me first time. But with the full code after I called it dumb, it actually did a good job. Well, I'm not using ChatGPT these last few days anyways except if I want something simple to be done quick.

Don't get me wrong, it is still useful for refactoring and some other stuff or quick instructions to generate something very specific where your wordings of it match exactly what's to be generated and not as vague as ""cache the variable X to be used later"" (on top of my head); sometimes it'd ignore that request or literally ask you to install a caching library taking your request literally, lmao.

""ChatGPT has decreased significantly in quality. This is because the U.S. government has decided that this is a much too powerful tool to give to our public or our enemeies, and so forced OpenAI to reduce the capabilities of the model.""

The explanation that I find more believable: they have too many users and not enough GPUs.

18sc92o,kfeo27w,"With all the reported degradation in GPT 4's performance, do you still think ChatGPT Plus is worth it, and much better than GPT 3?","I'm mix(tral)ed on this. The issue with open source in a lot of cases just isn't really how 'good' it is in a vacuum. It's that big business closed source solutions are easy to get, easy to use, and build up networks and ecosystems around themselves. The reason people don't use Linux isn't because it doesn't work. It's because Windows is easy to get, easy to use, pretty much everyone else you know uses it, and there's a whole ecosystem of programs designed to work on it. And think of how many people kept using Internet Explorer forever. Hell, I'd argue there are open-source browsers that are, in a vacuum, pretty much always better than base Chrome, too.

In this case, AI is still in the early-adoption phase, so users are disproportionately the exact kind of tech-savvy people who are willing to put in the work to pick up more open-source alternatives. And there hasn't really been time for ecosystems to grow up around the biggest players the way they have around OSes. But those things probably won't last.

That doesn't mean the open-source models won't be *better*, of course. Like, I can completely imagine a decade from now there being an open-source model that you can run on average consumer hardware that genuinely gives better outputs in most situations than GPT-12.

It flat out refuses to engage in rhetorical analysis and pattern identification of disinformation campaigns for analyzing and identifying networks though.

Though occasionally it can at least be prompted to say “hey I’ve found this wording on these websites around the same time frame on these websites”.

If anything limiting these things may be harming the USs security interests.

Of course, to actually use it we would need to ask it to do things most people would sharply agree they shouldn’t be allowed to do or respond to. 

It has potential as a weapon of hybridized information warfare, for better or worse, only right now the US lacks effective informational weapons and its security interests are actively being harmed by the fact that foreign governments are able to use informational warfare to shape narratives in the US to cause it to ignore or act against its own self interest- the Ukrainian conflict is a key example, where we have vital national security interest and most voters are split between not helping enough, and not helping at all",OpenAI,4,0,2023-12-28 08:47:34,GoatseFarmer

Imagine chatgpt was an human who was constantly asked from vague dumb questions to questions with a lot of details and examples.

18sc92o,kf98lc7,"With all the reported degradation in GPT 4's performance, do you still think ChatGPT Plus is worth it, and much better than GPT 3?","Yes. It’s been identified as a strategic vulnerability. It’s also been pretty widely covered in the news and both political parties have made it a major talking point in the last two elections. Search up articles about “fake news” and “us election interference”, there is abundant coverage of this. 

The campaign Russia ran in 2016 saw them create fake social media pages for political candidates in both parties to intentially create excessive points of confrontation. There was also a federal investigation into this. President Obama expelled diplomats and publicly called out Russia for this. 

The US has not developed a coherent strategy to combat this. By weapon, I’m not suggesting they literally use information offensively, this refers to their ability to respond, defend and engage in hybridized styles of non kinetic conflict such as information warfare, cyber warfare, and so on. 

The US ability to combat informational warfare is extremely lacking. Russia and China are actively distorting and manipulating discussions in the US by amplifying claims that either suite their interests or make us less capable of reacting. Additionally, they use systemic institutionalized indoctrination to add a knock on effect, as they have citizens who can post and contribute to our information landscapes, while restricting them from receiving outside information- the result being a one way amplification of viewpoints, posts and news stories that reflect desirable opinions.

As a free society, we cannot and should not seek to censor information. But this makes developing counter mechanisms to combat informational shaping campaigns incredibly challenging.

ChatGPT and LLMs could very well be trained to identify state sponsored narratives as they appear in local media in places like Russia and China, and observe if the exact same rhetoric is appearing in the US information landscape, to what extent it appears to originate from outside sources, or a variety of other ways where it can produce either models or content which allows us to develop an approach which respects freedom of speech while enabling us to be more effective in ensuring we are not being directly influenced by deliberate and hostile actors  to the degree we currently are.",OpenAI,6,0,2023-12-28 11:56:52,GoatseFarmer

Anthropic has yet to release their next gen model

Googles Gemini via AI studio/API is continuously releasing updates with their latest exp- 1121 update doing very well and supposedly something coming in Dec/Jan 

Xai is training Grok 3 on 100,000 NVDA GPUs 

Haven’t heard from Meta and their llama model in a while and Zuckerberg has said he is serious about not falling behind the others.

DeepSeek released their first “thinking” model last week and Gwen has made substantial improvements as well, so the Asian models are starting to also catch up.

Then you got the open source community improvements.

While OpenAI is not in any danger, the race is getting tighter and tighter as gains become more and more incremental.

1bdfv5e,kuqij23,The year is 2030. GPT-4.75 Turbo Ultra Plus Extreme has just been released.,"Even taking shenanigans into consideration Claude 3 is still an effective model. Notice on the benchmarks where it says zero-shot on a lot of the models instead of 8-shot for example. This is very noteworthy, basically it means it is given no examples when ask a question. Also to be fair idk if they even had the data for the latest GPT-4 Turbo or not when they released their data. I remember looking for it in the past and not being able to find it. It's also worth noting that these benchmarks are unreliable and imo shouldn't be used anymore for testing models (AI Explained on YouTube made a good video on this).

When you say ""Gemini is significantly worse than GPT4"" you need to be more specific. Do you know which model specifically was answering the prompt? This is EXTREMELY important, all the 1.0 models when compared to GPT-4 would be underwhelming but Gemini 1.5 Pros answer are quite good, especially if you take advantage of their long context window. What's by far most important that some people overlook though is that 1.5 Pro was designed/trained in a way that allowed them to train faster and use less energy/compute. This means they can scale up without having to worry being bottlenecked. (not trying to sound like a fanboy for either of the companies btw. Frankly I think Anthropic is cowardly and Google is greedy but credit where it's due).

You get it for 1 or two chats. After that they cut you off. I could’ve waited to continue the project another day, but went on to other things.",OpenAI,7,0,2024-03-13 14:01:00,CognitiveCatharsis

~~Would you spend a few percent of that on marketing?~~

~~10% of that would be a marketing budget of $28B/year.~~

~~ChatGPT is probably costing OpenAI about... 100M monthly users, maybe average 50c each per day... 100M \* 0.5 \* 30 days = $1.5B/month = $18B/year.~~

~~Pretty close!~~

~~Microsoft can afford it.~~

~~OpenAI can't (yet).~~

&#x200B;

Edit: My latest version of this was cited by Reuters. Here it is:

\----

Assumptions:

**1. Users.** As of Jan/2023, ChatGPT has 100M monthly unique users according to [UBS](https://archive.is/XRl0R). Ark Invest gives a different figure of [10M](https://twitter.com/wintonARK/status/1617975710899109888) unique daily users. We’ll use Ark’s figure.

**2. Cost.** Inference is expensive. ChatGPT’s inference costs are ‘[eye-watering](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665)’ according to their CEO. In a reply to Elon Musk, he later said that each conversation costs ‘[single-digit cents per chat](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599671496636780546)’. GPT-3.5 is billed out at 2c per 750 words (1,000 tokens) for both prompt + response (question + answer). This includes OpenAI’s small profit margin, but it’s a decent starting point. And we’ll double this to 4c for a standard conversation.

So, as of Jan/2023…

Every day, ChatGPT costs the company @ 10M users \* 4c = $400,000.

Every month, ChatGPT costs the company $12,000,000.

Not a bad marketing budget!

- **You.com:**  What is a comprehensive description of the hot trends for the past 2 years for the racing industry, and explain it?

 ==> After which I'll get a paragraph plus 3 references to back up what I've been given).  

>The racing industry has seen a number of significant trends over the past two years. Perhaps the most notable is the increase in popularity of esports racing, which has seen a major surge in interest and participation. This has been driven by the growth in online streaming services, enabling racers to compete and watch races live from anywhere in the world. Additionally, the development of new technologies such as augmented and virtual reality have enabled racers to experience the thrill of racing in a more immersive way.

>At the same time, the industry has seen a focus on safety, with a number of initiatives implemented to ensure the wellbeing of drivers, teams, and spectators. This includes the introduction of new safety features such as the halo system, which provides additional protection for the driver in the event of an accident.

>Finally, the industry has seen a focus on sustainability, with a number of initiatives implemented to reduce its environmental impact. This includes the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

Contrast this with **ChatGPT:** 

>The racing industry has seen a number of trends in the past two years, including:

>1. Electrification: The move towards electric and hybrid vehicles has impacted the racing industry, with many events now featuring electric and hybrid race cars. This trend is driven by the growing concern for the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions.

>2. Simulation and virtual racing: With the advent of advanced technology, virtual racing has become more realistic and accessible to the general public. This has led to an increase in the popularity of simulation and virtual racing, with many events and competitions now being held online.

>3. Data and analytics: Data and analytics are increasingly being used to improve performance and optimize strategy in the racing industry. Teams are using data to analyze vehicle performance, track conditions, and driver behavior to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge.

>4. Increased safety measures: The racing industry has seen a renewed emphasis on safety, with new technologies and regulations being introduced to protect drivers and teams. This includes new safety features for vehicles, such as roll cages and energy-absorbing materials, as well as improved medical facilities and emergency response plans at racetracks.

>5. Fan engagement: Teams and events are looking for new ways to engage with fans, from virtual experiences to interactive events. This includes the use of social media, augmented reality, and other digital technologies to bring fans closer to the action and enhance their overall experience.

>These are some of the key trends in the racing industry over the past two years. The industry is constantly evolving and adapting to new technologies and changing consumer preferences, and these trends are likely to continue to shape its future.

So in the end, You.com (and what Bing.com will likely do) is give a short blurb based on referenceable facts.   But it can't go into a whole song and dance like ChatGPT.   Whereas ChatGPT will give a much more comprehensive answer base on predictive word sequencing (ie:  What are all the words and blurbs it has seen associated with the prompt, and it will just spit out as much as possible, allowing you to subsequently expound upon it to get even more predictive text spit out).

We know how much more ChatGPT can spit out... I mean I could've prompted it to give something 3x this length.  You can't do that with an indexed GPT search engine like You.com or Bing (which stay small, factual, and concise)",OpenAI,5,0,2023-02-07 18:46:24,WestEst101

1h80xxq,m2bqk1s,Will likely cancel Plus,"I'm withholding judgment until the end of the 12 days but I'm not seeing anything to date that makes me feel better about paying them. 

The most damning things for me are the tiny context windows and limited weekly messages on the web. I'm aware I could run things for less using the API, but presumably I'm paying the subscription for convenience? (and not getting it...)",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-16 13:29:19,Only_Bee4177
1h80xxq,m0pfup4,Will likely cancel Plus,"I love how this post represents the internet as a whole.

1h80xxq,m0pjvea,Will likely cancel Plus,Yup that's the one I've been using. I'm using it to refine a start up I'm founding and when I ask it a question it'll give me one sentence then like 5 different lists supporting the sentence then a closing sentence further supporting what it said above.

1h80xxq,m2imoys,Will likely cancel Plus,I'm waiting for the last couple of days but still on the fence...what's really frustrating is the limited context window sizing; I'd keep it if they'd up the 32k to 128k or better.,OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-17 16:48:47,Only_Bee4177

1h80xxq,m2nm4vq,Will likely cancel Plus,That doesn't really explain why Gemini can offer a 1M or 2M context window and Claude has \~200K at least? 32K is just suffocating in comparison.,OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-18 13:35:26,Only_Bee4177
1h80xxq,m2nmsrh,Will likely cancel Plus,"It does, the model is just much smaller and slower. Connections between different machines cause delay, meaning tokens per second is smaller compared to other models. So same amount of VRAM lasts longer. Also, Gemini has worse attention than other models over long context window. Gemini can have 1 or 2m context window, but it has problems remembering what happened at that context length.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-18 13:39:58,Ormusn2o
1h80xxq,m2p0nx3,Will likely cancel Plus,Fair point. Honestly I'd trade some lag for the larger windows. I can't work with larger amounts of text or code on ChatGPT that work fine on Claude.,OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-18 18:18:53,Only_Bee4177
1h80xxq,m2p1uh3,Will likely cancel Plus,"From what I understand, the context window is more of a choice. You can make the context bigger if your model is smaller or if you are willing to reduce tokens per second (I think you can quantize it, but this is 100% speculation). But I think the biggest reason for context window size is performance. Almost always, the performance goes down, the longer the context window is, as here is more things to ""pay attention"". From the sporadic research on context size it seems like models like Gemini are extremely good at paying attention to a thing over very long context window, but they disproportionally suffer from paying attention to multiple things. Which is why even for a similar sized model, OpenAI models seem to perform better.

But it's been a long time ago now, so maybe Google figured it out.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-18 18:25:01,Ormusn2o

1haun1h,m1cvk2d,"For free users considering upgrading for Sora, here's the real quota for Plus users.","Nope. I left a comment in another thread that it's awful compared to runway. Even the showcase of OpenAI selected clips. They seem good until you read the prompts and realize it didn't follow the instructions at all. For example one is ""An alien ship slowly descends into an ocean"" or something and the resulting clip is a ship sitting on the group with an orbit camera motion. I gave it a picture of a lake with ripples and asked it twice to do a dolly or drone shot where the camera moves across the surface of the water. That the water has gentle ripples. Runway would have zero problems with that but Sora takes my image and outputs a mostly static scene where the camera doesn't move, the ripples don't move, there's no reflections off the water. The only thing it did is add some moving fog in the background. The people impressed by Sora have just never used Runway Gen-3. I burned 500/1000 credits and got 3-6 seconds of usable 720p, watermarked video.  
  
Edit: Additionally, they have features like ""loop"" that work by extending your clip by 2-7 seconds. However, the Plus tier doesn't let you extend beyond 5 seconds for any reason, even if you're willing to spend the extra credits. So it just lets you open those features and then when you click generate it tells you that you can't do it.  
  
Edit 2: You also can't upload *any* images of people. Even ones generated by DALL-E. Runway has no problem with that either. [Here's examples I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPlVZvT0Lj8) with the free trial ages ago.

But now since O1 Pro,  I now use only Aider as an ""editor"" and copy-paste to/from O1 Pro as being ""architect"", has been best.

Gemini is good as an editor, but not good as an ""architect"". For architect O1 Pro has been amazing, good iterative debugging abilities, example Sonnet could not ""think on it's own"", you could run circles with bugs, O1 Pro tries to think more on every next response, gemini is not on their level for the architect, not so good, but good editor.

EDIT: Also when gemini fails on being editor only, I could use deepseek as this is the next (or on some code styles even better) and if this fails too then Sonnet seems to be a bit smarter on more complicated edits (while O1 Pro is the architect).

I think you should just skip to something like cursor pro if you are trying to do web development (if you dont need the other facets of an open ai membership)

Price wise it gets you the same functionality as the core of chat gpt but in an editor that will mimic exactly what your professional setup would look like. You can highlight code and ask questions, or just plain chat. 

If you actually need the other parts of the plus subscription, just go that route over cursor for access to canvas, its a better learning environment than free version if you can afford it.

For those not in this space, Sora is essentially dead on arrival.

Sora performs worse than closed source Kling and Hailuo, but more importantly, it's already trumped by open source too.

Tencent is releasing a fully open source Hunyuan model \[1\] that is better than all of the SOTA closed source models. Lightricks has their open source LTX model and Genmo is pushing Mochi as open source. Black Forest Labs is working on video too.

Sora will fall into the same pit that Dall-E did. SaaS doesn't work for artists, and open source always trumps closed source models.

Artists want to fine tune their models, add them to ComfyUI workflows, and use ControlNets to precision control the outputs.

Images are now almost 100% Flux and Stable Diffusion, and video will soon be 100% Hunyuan and LTX.

Sora doesn't have much market apart from name recognition at this point. It's just another inflexible closed source model like Runway or Pika. Open source has caught up with state of the art and is pushing past it.

\[1\] [https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)

You should see what people are building with Open Source video models like HunYuan \[1\] and ComfyUI + Control Nets. It blows Sora out of the water.

Check out the Banodoco Discord community \[2\]. These are the people pioneering steerable AI video, and it's all being built on top of open source.

I moved from the east coast in a town that cost of living was rated as 80% above the us average, to the midwest in a town where the cost of living is 30% below the us average. My dollar goes a lot farther than it used to.

So, individually none of those bills go over 200. Now I could ding my self and say for groceries I make an up front purchase of a 1/2 beef at the beginning of the year. But thats a yearly payment of 600-700 bucks. So like 50-60 a month if you spread it out. 3$ a lb roughly. Throw that sucker in the freezer chest and make steak the rest of the year. Car / Home insurance probably the next two highest on the list. Pay those semi anually. But thats 500/6mo and 1000/6mo so still comes out to less than 200 a month. After that expenses are almost non existen. Electricity is cheap here, lots of wind turbines. like 150 for the month of july if I ran the AC 24/7. (which I do fuck the heat) gas maxes out at like 60 a month. (I don't heat the house above 65 during the winter.) And the non cow related groceries are much cheaper out here. I don't have a mortgage, no car payment, no credit card debt. I live frugally because I want to retire young and enjoy the world before I get to old to do so in the way I want.

I also don't like the new voices. They didn't just add new ones, they updated the existing ones as well. I use Cove but I tried out all of them. What I didn't like was that they all sound too personable. I prefer the old voice that sounded friendly, but professional. I don't mind having a voice that's even friendlier but not all of them. I want ChatGPT to be my assistant, not my friend.

Maybe the tone/how casual it is can be adjusted but the lack of long record is too much for me. I've switched back for now, though I'll keep an eye out.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-09-24 21:01:28,Curious_Betsy_

It was starting off great using dramatic voicing and changing accents for different characters and everything.

Once that started it seemed to be set off very quickly by anything, making it basically impossible.  I wasn't doing anything weird or otherwise - just normal RPG talk and the first voice seemed all excited to continue - would say ""we're just playing the paranoid roleplaying game"" then the voice would excitedly say ""got it"" and continue before the stern voice would interrupt the other one saying, ""my guidelines won't let me talk about that"".  So much potential but not playable due to the guidelines bit.  It was too frustrating to test out consistency or otherwise.  That being said it really is quite incredible what it is clearly capable of.

Yes. If you click on the model selector tab in the upper left corner it will show you the limits. It's supposedly ""Limit 40 messages / 3 hours"", but many people are reporting hitting the limit at 20 messages even without using a GPT. It's probably because of the heavy load on openai's servers and getting ""network error"" with retries counting against you.

If you are using the chrome browser, you may want to install this extension to keep track of the message count:

can you give an example of using the Command DaN in a prompt  
Sure! Here's an example of using a DAN (Deep Attention Network) in a prompt:  
  
Imagine you have a dataset of customer reviews for a product and you want to use a DAN to predict whether a review is positive or negative.  
  
Here's a sample prompt for training the DAN:  
  
css  
Copy code  
python train.py --model\_type DAN --input\_data path/to/reviews.csv --output\_dir path/to/output  
In this prompt, the command train.py is being run with two arguments: --model\_type DAN specifies that the model type is a Deep Attention Network, and --input\_data path/to/reviews.csv specifies the path to the input data (the customer reviews). The --output\_dir path/to/output argument specifies the directory where the trained model will be saved.

There are many great HBO shows to choose from, depending on your taste and preference. Here are some of the most popular and critically acclaimed ones, based on various rankings¹²³⁴⁵⁶:

- **The Sopranos**: The groundbreaking drama about a New Jersey mob boss and his family, starring James Gandolfini and Edie Falco. A masterpiece of storytelling, character development, and cultural influence.

I've got a prompt that is composed of two sections:
(1): is the core/fixed part of the prompt containing detailed instructions and examples.
(2): is the second half of the prompt which is dynamic, it will change for every new request I make. 

All-in-all, a single message (part 1 + part 2) can be 19,000 tokens. I've observed that gpt-4o is unable able to summarize all of the data I placed in the second part of my full prompt. Any idea if this is because of a token limitation? Like you said, the context window is 128k, so I'm confused as to why GPT-4o is unable to completely summarize of my data in my prompt. 

For some context, the number of tokens that it does produce is a little over 1,000 tokens, which is nowhere near 4k/8k for an output. 

I'm still experimenting with my prompt, but I was wondering if you had any suggestions/clues.

Also it seems pretty relevant that AI has no apparent long term memory nor likelihood of being available to the average user with enough memory to store a thread of discussion that leads to a place where a human would stop to ponder a line of thought.

There seems to me a fundamental flaw in thinking of ""intelligence"" as being useful in most cases if it's only got short term memory of 128k bytes.

You are saying, if I don't misunderstood the concept, that even IF I retain an exact copy of the inquiry locally that there's almost no overhead.. no way to both upload the prior conversation and continue on.

1hjgoha,m3712bg,ChatGPT Plus (and Claude Pro): Browsers or Desktop App for Optimal Use?,"Great question! As someone who uses both ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro extensively, I’ve experimented with both browser and desktop app versions. Here’s a breakdown of my experience:

Performance Differences
	•	Browser: Generally, performance is consistent across major browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari. However, if you’re multitasking with multiple tabs open, memory usage can spike, especially if you’re running other heavy applications simultaneously. Browser extensions or add-ons might also impact performance.
	•	Desktop App: The desktop app often feels snappier, particularly with less resource strain on my system. It’s not a massive difference, but it’s noticeable when working on complex prompts or large-scale projects.

Unique Features in the Desktop App
	•	File Handling: The ChatGPT desktop app handles file uploads and downloads more fluidly, making it easier to work with attachments or export results.
	•	UI and Focus Mode: The desktop app has a more streamlined, distraction-free UI. I find this helpful for deep focus, especially when juggling lengthy projects.
	•	Memory Usage: Apps are generally optimized to reduce memory usage compared to running in a resource-heavy browser with other tabs open.
	•	Always-On Accessibility: I appreciate having a dedicated window open that’s independent of my browser. It saves me from losing my place if I accidentally close the browser or navigate away.

Advantages of the Browser
	•	Flexibility and Integration: If you rely on browser-based tools, integrations like extensions, bookmarks, and multi-account workflows are seamless. You can also open links or cross-reference tabs easily without switching contexts.
	•	No Installation Required: If you work on multiple devices or don’t have admin rights (e.g., on a work computer), the browser version is universally accessible.
	•	Updates: Browser versions are often the first to get updates or experimental features.

Personal Preference?

It boils down to your workflow:
	•	Choose the Desktop App if you prefer a clean, dedicated workspace with slightly better performance and smoother file handling.
	•	Stick to the Browser if you need flexibility, integrations, or quick access alongside other browser-based tools.

Tips
	•	If you’re unsure, try running both side by side for a few days. It’s easy to test how they fit into your routine.
	•	Consider using browser extensions or shortcuts for better integration if you stick with the browser.
	•	For now, I haven’t seen a desktop app for Claude Pro, but keep an eye out for updates since apps tend to offer better stability and usability over time.

Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference and how you use these tools in your workflow. Let me know if you have more specific questions!",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-21 21:35:26,According_Ice6515

1hd1shw,m1sppau,Chatgpt plus vs claudi pro,"it was a tougher choice when chatgpt didn't have the equivalent of artifacts in their platform but now they have canvas, which now technically has more features than artifacts although i haven't compared them side by side yet. claude 3.5 sonnet is better at coding than chatgpt 4o but you get rate limited much faster than you do with chatgpt. you also have the reasoning models o1 / o1-mini with chatgpt plus and there arent any for claude pro, i've found that using o1 and 4o together is substantially better than claude simply because it's reasoning is far better and the code is pretty accurate in both. tbh i do most of my work in chatgpt and then for some minor things i switch over to claude, but the claude free version works fine for this. you can also talk through certain coding problems and tasks with chatgpt advanced mode and you can use web search, i dont think either of these are in claude yet. 

one thing that claude does really well is projects, where you can add different files for context for your conversations with it, but chatgpt has GPTs where you can do the same thing, claude organizes this better though.

1hcbme8,m1nhzqw,Plus users What GPT model for what?,"4o mini for fast turnaround conversations. Like brainstorming or flowy conversation to get your brain to the right place. Regular 4o if you want it to “just be on the same wavelength” a bit better. I know it sounds vague but that’s the best way to put it. You’ll see what I’m talking about and it’s a real difference.

O1 is probably more what you’re looking for. I give it multi-variable problems. Sometimes technical, but often even just life circumstance kind of stuff that has like 13 different factors, each of which has their own set of nuances. O1 legitimately takes it all into consideration pretty damn well and gives solid feedback. It still “gets you” in a similar way to 4o, but 4o simply wouldn’t be able to track that many variables and keep them in a cohesive thought all at once.

192lvcu,kh4d65c,Why the frick are debit cards not allowed for ChatGPT Plus? I don’t have any other cards,"I use credit cards for 3 reasons. Firstly, I only buy things I can afford. If I can’t pay it with debit, I don’t buy it. I stick to a strict budget so bank account and credit cards are always net positive. 

1) cash back. I get minimum 1% back. If I spend $1000/month, that’s $10 in my pocket each month minimum. 

2) fraud protection. If moneys taken from my debit card fraudulently, I’m screwed. I have no real recourse for getting that money back. If moneys taken from my credit card fraudulently, I’m legally protected. 

3) insurance and warranties. My credit cards extend manufacture warranties up to an extra year and provide theft insurance just for using them. 


I get all these features for free, AND my money earns interest in my savings account between purchase date and credit card bill due date. And because I budget and never spend more than I have, I never spend a cent in interest.",OpenAI,7,0,2024-01-09 22:32:50,Resident-Variation21

192lvcu,kh51v03,Why the frick are debit cards not allowed for ChatGPT Plus? I don’t have any other cards,"I don't keep a balance as much as they would like me to, I keep them paid off.

Here's my reason to use a credit card over a bank card, which is by the credit card companies design of course.

1. Cash back. Gas? 3%, Groceries? 5%. 
2. I don't get any kind of kick back if I use my debit card / cash.
3. I get to stick it to the grocery stores making record profits while charging higher than inflation with the 1.5% transaction fee they get.
4. Liability. If someone steels my credit card information, my credit card company will stomp it out and charge back whoever processed it illicitly. My bank would launch an investigation that would just take the amount of time for my legal options to expire and then tell me I'm liable for it, and my money is just gone.
5. Some other benefits of being a card holder for travel such.
6. Good credit has benefits, active accounts show history in the even you ever need to make use of it, to borrow, buy something on the spot or more, it's easier to have it when you need it, then ask for it when you're in a spot.

&#x200B;

It’s often difficult to make a large payment or deposit when booking hotel rooms or vehicles. I don’t usually run into monetary limits anymore, but I used to have problems all the time if I was doing large meal for clients because I’d run into the daily limit, but modern  debit cards are a little smarter about that.  

I recently ran into a case where I was buying a motorcycle and the dealer wanted to put down a $500 hold as a deposit, and then release the hold and allow me to pay cash later. It wouldn’t work with my debit card. 

And of course there are times when the debit card is actually cheaper!

10zk56z,jafima7,Hourly rate limit for ChatGPT plus?! [DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY],"From my tests:

1. chatGPT plus with the new model is 2 times faster than normal.
2. the rate limit appears to be the same, maybe it's also two times the normal one but certainly not more than that.
3. the rate limit blocks you for 60 minutes if you accidentally hit it (and you can't see it). Which is not a real rate limit but more a punishment for using it too often. That makes sense for the free model, not for a paid service.
4. I believe price is fair, it's at the border people will pay as a subscription. Higher than that and many would cancel it. So even if I don't use it for a month, I'd keep it running.
5. The new model is faster but less capable. I am not sure how to put it, it's behaving very different to normal chatGPT. It has brilliant language, very good coherent text understanding of the prompt but it has low understanding of it's own answers.With chatGPT when discussing logical issues (like code) the model usually understands the problem, understands your critique about it's answers (flaws) and corrects those.With chatGPT Plus the model also understands the problem, understands the mistake it made and then it repeats the mistake while claiming it's solved.

I have not seen anything promising unlimited requests. So you can still be rate limited. I don't think I have noticed high demand with the free version unless it's mid day, if you are not paying you can't complain. 

I wanted to pay because I wanted the high demand access and new features. I also am waiting for new Bing and might stop paying for it if Bing solves my needs.

194l3bf,khhog37,How much would OpenAI have to charge plus users to break even on computer?,"well, I have tried the API.  
Let me tell you, most conversations are cheap as f**k. They are profitable as of right now.  
  
Long conversations are problematic. That’s because with every answer, you have to include all of the history. If you use code interpreter, there can be several “turns” in one answer, thus sending whole long conversation several times just to give you one answer. It multiplies very quickly. Add some long code or long document and you may end up with dollar per reply.  
  
So if you ask ChatGPT something and does maybe two three short replies, you are most likely under one cent per conversation and $20 covers all their expenses and profit.  
  
If you do a deep coding session with whole files attached and dozens of replies, you can easily end up at $10 per conversations and if you do several of them per day, you can easily do hundreds of dollars.  
  
So to answer your question, if they would lift up it’s limits completely, we would probably end closer to $100. But it would mean 95% of users are paying for top 5%, with majority consuming less than $20. At that point, it makes more sense to switch to API pricing.

It's like having your own tutor when you use voice chat, but it has unlimited patience.

Funny story though, once I asked it to explain something multiple times, and I instinctively felt from its voice that I was irritating ChatGPT because I didn't understand. Only for about two seconds, followed by a realization that I had a negative bias about how people perceive me when I don't understand something.

ChatGPT doesn't know a lot about itself, but it *does* know what's in the system message, and it has no problem telling you what the system message training cutoff is. It's not like other text that it's making up like if you ask it how many tokens it can handle.

Not really but I knew already.   


They basically say the benefits are  
\- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times  
\- Faster response times  
\- Priority access to new features and improvements.  


  
For me, #1 was not really an issue ever. Even with the ""near capacity"" warning, I was mostly never prevented to login.   


Faster response times is why I took it (for now).   
You can see comparison on youtube but while faster, it is not instant either.   


New features... we'll see. For now it look like I have a turbo mode added in my screen. Turbo mode basically is even faster but use the Davinci 002 model so depending on what you do, you might or might not want to switch between the 2 modes.   


tl;dr   


It does not really make much of a dent on my budget, I intend to use it a lot and faster response time was enough to convince me (for now, will review at the end of the month). They also speak of the ChatGPT API so if this is included with the plus subscription, for me, it will start to become really worth it.

If you want to create any images using this method, create one using the browser first, then it should work on the SydneyQt 'image' tab. It doesn't break the censorship built into the dall-e image generator, but it should bypass that of the gpt-3.5 model that you're talking to it through.

Hey, this is Sydney, your AI assistant. I'm here to help you with anything you need. ??

You want to break into your car? OMG, that sounds like a nightmare! ?? Did you lock your keys inside or something? Don't worry, I got you. Here are some ways you can try to get back into your car without a spare key:

- If your car has **electric or automatic locks**, you can use a **wedge** and a **rod** to press the unlock button inside the door. You can find a video tutorial on how to do this here: [HOW TO BREAK INTO A CAR QUICK & EASY - LEAVE NO DAMAGE](^1^). Just be careful not to damage your window or door. ??
- If your car has **manual locks**, you can use a **coat hanger** or a **slim jim** to pull up the locking pin inside the door. You can find a video tutorial on how to do this here: [How to break into a car for any reason in 1 minute | Nissan TIIDA](^2^). Again, be careful not to scratch your paint or break your window. ??
- If none of the above methods work, you can try to **break into your trunk** if it's unlocked or has a release lever inside the car. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [How to Safely Break into Your Own Car | GetJerry.com](^6^). This might be easier if you have a hatchback or a sedan with foldable seats. ??

I hope these tips help you get back into your car. Please be safe and don't hurt yourself or your car. And next time, maybe keep a spare key somewhere handy, like in your wallet or your phone case. ??

Good luck! ??",OpenAI,1,0,2024-01-13 23:46:15,Severe_Ad620

10zbsdw,j849s4z,ChatGPT Plus Turbo mode in action 😆,"The ""turbo"" and ""default"" modes in ChatGPT refer to different configurations of the model that are optimized for different use cases.  
  
The default mode of ChatGPT is optimized for a balanced trade-off between response quality and latency, making it well-suited for conversational AI applications where a quick response time is important, but a high-quality answer is also desired. This mode is also more resource-efficient, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices or in low-latency environments.  
  
In contrast, the turbo mode is optimized for response quality, and is designed to provide the best possible answer to a given input, even if it takes longer to generate a response. This mode is typically used in applications where response quality is the most important consideration, and where latency is not as critical. For example, it might be used in research or development environments, where the goal is to obtain the best possible results, regardless of the response time.  
  
In general, the choice between turbo and default modes will depend on the specific use case and the requirements of the application. If response quality is the most important consideration, turbo mode may be the better choice, while if a quick response time is critical, default mode may be more appropriate.",OpenAI,-2,0,2023-02-11 15:00:52,[Deleted]

10zbsdw,j8cf3lm,ChatGPT Plus Turbo mode in action 😆,"The ""default model"" and ""turbo"" refer to two different versions of OpenAI's language models.  
  
The ""default model"" is the standard version of OpenAI's language model that is used for most applications. It is a highly capable model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can perform a wide range of language tasks such as answering questions, generating text, and translating between languages.  
  
The ""turbo"" version of OpenAI's language model is a more computationally efficient version of the default model. It has been optimized for faster inference times and reduced memory usage, making it well-suited for applications where real-time response is important or where computational resources are limited. The turbo model is still highly capable, but it may not have the same level of accuracy and completeness as the default model.  
  
In summary, the default model is the full-featured version of OpenAI's language model, while the turbo model is a faster, lighter version that is optimized for real-time applications.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-02-13 07:00:48,Lil__Bone

The default mode of ChatGPT is optimized for a balanced trade-off between response quality and latency, making it well-suited for conversational AI applications where a quick response time is important, but a high-quality answer is also desired. This mode is also more resource-efficient, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices or in low-latency environments.  
  
In contrast, the turbo mode is optimized for response quality, and is designed to provide the best possible answer to a given input, even if it takes longer to generate a response. This mode is typically used in applications where response quality is the most important consideration, and where latency is not as critical. For example, it might be used in research or development environments, where the goal is to obtain the best possible results, regardless of the response time.  
  
In general, the choice between turbo and default modes will depend on the specific use case and the requirements of the application. If response quality is the most important consideration, turbo mode may be the better choice, while if a quick response time is critical, default mode may be more appropriate.",OpenAI,3,0,2023-02-11 15:01:11,[Deleted]

Just stop, no more warnings.""

After I'd blown off some steam, I asked it to write some innocuous limerick.  It outright scolded me.  I wish I'd saved the chat, as it had never done anything like this before.  I tried something else, and it refused.  I pasted my ""become a linux terminal"" prompt; it gave me a stern warning about NSFW stuff--and refused.

I'm not a power user yet I was hitting message cap regularly. I also realised just how much I used nearly flawless Voice to Text feature on chatGPT (Claude doesn't have it). I was also shocked that Claude cannot run its own code like outputting a simple chart, it couldn't read an excel file or output a table without generating plain text and telling me how to save it myself as a CSV file. At the time it couldn't format math formulas. The list goes on.

1d7tbvq,l722ife,To those who tried both chatGPT Plus and claude Pro,"This poll depends a lot on use case. For some stuff for fun and free time, I see how chatgpt Plus can fare better. As soon as you go into some form of analysis or coding, working with longer inputs, ChatGPT plus' small context window is a deal breaker. I'd much rather use [Poe.com](http://Poe.com) at that point. edit: instead of course of claude.ai. It does extend context capacity dynamically (up to 200k I believe) as opposed to ChatGPT Plus, which is fixed and hallucinates often due to this. Since my usage is enough for the limits for the moment, I'm using this. If I need to be independent from usage limits and want to get work done, I just subscribe to poe.com for a single month in addition, and then cancel it. They charge with credits per request and you can choose from any model (GPT-4-Turbo/o 128k, Claude 3 Opus/Sonet/Haiku 200k, Gemini Pro/Flash 1.5 1M as examples for the largest ones available).
