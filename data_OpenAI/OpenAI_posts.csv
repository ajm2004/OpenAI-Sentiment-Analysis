This is an example where the illusion paradigm causes a strong association in the model’s training set, so when shown a false version, it incorrectly makes that association.

Knowledge distillation (student modeling)

Step distillation (latent consistent modeling)

There are several significant differences between both the 1980s and the 1950s. Thanks to Moore's law, dying as it is, and Dennard scaling, which died in like 2005 or 2006, computers are almost incomprehensibly better than even 1989. Thanks to the internet, social media, smart phones, etc. there has been an enormous of data digitalized since late 1982 when the compact disk came out and widely distributed. 

As late as the mid 1960s a supercomputer like the CDC 6600 had less computer power and memory than the original, completely obsolete Apple Watch. A single modern desktop computer with a Nvidia 4090 would probably outperform the combined computing power of every single computer in existence on Earth in 1955, not just the digital ones, but the electromechanical ones too. 

Even the pandemic helped shaped things to require less human presence in a certain room, between things like Zoom and Microsoft teams, co-workers could be across the world, or even completely virtual. 

AI users are creating new data by just providing prompts, voice conversations, code, photos, and videos to AI that it can train on. OpenAI has 300 million weekly active users. They are most likely generating a significant amount of new data. Then I still think there is tons of untapped data to train models on. Everything from police body cameras, to CCTVs across the world, to military drone videos, to Waymo and Tesla camera and sensor data. I'm sure there is plenty more.

>I'd imagine investors will blink before we get all of that figured out, so it may be a longer wait than you think.

That is quite possibly true, but Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia all have other profit centers that are enabling them to dump mountains of money into AI, and even if they cut back as a collective from like 50-60 billion every three months, to something much lower, it will still probably be several billion or even tens of billions of dollars per year.

Because benchmarks are like exam scores, you get somewhere between 0-100% of it right.  If you go from getting 0% of it right (effectively o1) to getting 85% of it right, how much of an increase *in intelligence* is that?  Now imagine you have another model that is 10x more intelligent than o3?  Would it get 100% on the benchmark?  What about 1,000,000x more intelligent?  Well, it can't get *more* than 100% so that benchmark doesn't actually distinguish between those cases.

See what I mean?  Regardless, it went from not being able to solve a broad and seemingly important class of problems to now being able to solve them reliably.  So we know it has increased in intelligence by a notable amount.  Bringing it back to this actual post, it is the reason you can't use o1 to judge whether o3 is capable of something because we already have a ton of examples of things that o3 can do that o1 could not.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-22 20:39:46,Cryptizard

You tune it and train it on data that has the same or similar statistical properties. Just because you didn't train directly on the real-time, real-world data, doesn't mean you didn't train and tune your model FOR it. If I made a model that's supposed to predict future stock prices, I obviously can't train it on the future stock data - the data doesn't exist. But I can train it on past data and tune it so that it accurately represents that past data but maintains an ability to generalise, at which point I can apply it to future data.

Training doesn't just mean looking at the exact data you're going to test on, and learning from that. It also means looking at similar data. Which is what happened here.

  
Using the public training and evaluation set IS a form of training and tuning FOR the private test set. It is not direct training ON the private test set, but it is still a way to tune FOR it, and if it wasn't the very organisation that provides the public set wouldn't explicitly tell competitors ""here is data you can use to train and tune for the private test that is roughly the same difficulty and tests the same cognitive priors"".

Conversations work both ways, with both sides sharing their posts and answering questions, that's how communication works buddy.

To answer your question, I use the real established definition of reasoning, to use logic or reason to work through a problem. No LLM does this, functionally speaking an LLM simply predicts what the most likely next word or word chunk (aka token) is. At best the o1 line of models EMULATES or imitates this, it's trained and instructed to predict word chunks that establish a pattern for the model to ""decide"" the next tokens more accurately, but even then I'm using those words highly metaphorically.

It's like those old mechanical calculators, they give you any addition or substraction or multiplication answer, but they don't work by subtracting or multiplying, they use repeat addition and overflow addition to EMULATE multiplication and subtraction.

For a model to ""reason"" would require a completely different type of model than what LLM's currently use. Transformer models like current LLM's literally cannot reason, it's literally impossible. It can find solutions to questions that would TYPICALLY require reasoning, but that's like that calculator using addition to find solutions to problems that would TYPICALLY require subtraction or multiplication. It's not the same thing even if it can find similar answers.

In reality, you have to deal with incomplete and inconsistent requirements, information spread over issues, discussions, excels and sharepoints, and the solution often involves modifying code across multiple files in a codebase, sometimes across service boundaries, where coordination with other teams is required.

So only when LLM become good at navigating these complex environments, then I can see how they replace programmers. Until then, they’re nice tools for us to get well-defined sub-tasks done a bit quicker",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-22 11:57:34,M8Ir88outOf8

So o3 spending 350K to score 99% isn’t that impressive over o1. Obviously long compute time and more resources to check validity of its answer will increase accuracy, but it needs to be balanced with the cost. O1 was already expensive for retail, o3 just took cost a magnitude higher.

1hir24l,m32boee,OpenAI o3 is equivalent to the #175 best human competitive coder on the planet.,"These benchmarks are absolutely stupid.
Competitive coding boils down to memorizing and how quickly you can recognize a problem and use your memorized tools to solve them.

It in no way reflects real development and anybody who trains competitive coding long enough can become good at it.

It is perfect for AI because it has data to learn from and extrapolate.

Real engineering problems are not like that..

I use AI daily for work (both openAI and Claude) as substitute for documentation and I can't stress how much AI sucks at writing code longer than 50 lines.

It is good for short simple algorithms or for generating suboptimal library / framework examples as you don't need to look at docs or stack overflow.

With my experience the o model is still a lot better than o1 and Claude is seemingly still the best. O1 felt like a straight downgrade. 

So just a rough estimate where these benchmarks are.
They are useless and are most Iikely for investors to generate hype and meet KPIs.

It means that open AI is on the right track to achieve AGI and eventually, ASI and it’s only a matter of bringing efficiency up and compute cost down.

Probably, we will discover that there are other niches of intelligence these models can’t yet achieve at any scale and we will get some more breakthroughs along the way to full AGI.

Agree on cheaper but the ""way"" and ""lol"" both make me suspect your personal estimate is not as accurate as you think it is. 

I work daily with vendors across a range of products and tasks from design through support and while $7,500 would definitely be a larger-than-average invoice for a one-off task it's certainly not high enough to be worth anyone ""lol'ing"" about it. \~$225/hr is probably pretty close to average at the moment for engineering hours from a vendor, and if we're working on an enhancement to an existing system 9 times out of 10 that's going to be someone who isn't intimately familiar with our specific environment so there's going to be ramp-up time before they can even start working on a solution, then obviously time for them to validate what they build (and you don't get a discount if they don't get it right on the first go).

The last invoice I signed off on for a one-off enhancement was \~$4,990 give or take, and I have signed at least a half dozen in the last 5 years that exceeded $10k.

Obviously this is the math for vendors/contractors, so not exactly the same as an in-house resource, but as the person you're responding to eluded to there's an enormous amount of overhead with an FTE plus opportunity cost to consider.

But also here, the processors are becoming advanced and more tailored to execute the task, which results in more effective training per watt spend.

I was referring to the cost of the specific model itself, after it has been trained in combination with the advancement of the model itself. 

This is the price development for GPT 4, which includes improvements on the model itself.

If you do the math 10,000 people getting paid an average of $100,000 each for 10 years is $10,000,000,000… imo they made a smart 10 year investment by buying 49% of ChatGPT and laying off the humans who might not even stay with the company for 10 years.

1hir24l,m3a1gn8,OpenAI o3 is equivalent to the #175 best human competitive coder on the planet.,"Quick disclaimer: I'm not an AI researcher - this is all based on hands-on experience rather than academic research.

I was lucky to work with LLMs early on, implementing RAG solutions for clients before most of the modern frameworks existed. This gave me a chance to experiment with different approaches.

One interesting pipeline I tried was a feedback loop system:

\- Feed query to LLM

\- Generate search terms

\- Vector search database for relevant chunks

\- Feed results back to LLM

\- Repeat if needed

This actually worked better in some cases, but there's a catch - more iterations meant higher costs and slower responses. What O1 seems to be doing is building something similar directly into their training process.

While this brute force approach can improve accuracy, I think we're hitting diminishing returns. Yes, statistically, more iterations increase the chance of a correct answer, but there's a problem: Each loop reinforces certain ""paths"" of thinking. If the LLM starts down the wrong path in the first iteration, you risk getting stuck in a loop of wrong answers. Just throwing more computing power at this won't solve the fundamental issue.

I think we need a different approach altogether. Maybe something like specialized smaller LLMs with a smart ""router"" that decides which expert model is best for each query. There's already research happening in this direction.

But again, take this with a grain of salt - I'm just sharing what I've learned from working with these systems in practice.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-22 13:16:19,Teo9631

We'll see how much of o3's benchmarks translate to real world.

Also, your ""couple of small nuclear reactors"" may be very conservative at current apparent o3 cost. Let's say 10% of its cost is electricity and a query costs $7500 at high compute. This puts it at $750 in electricity, or more than 5 MWh at a typical average cost of $0.14/kWh. 

Given a query only runs for 10 minutes, that means a draw of more like 30 MW per execution (INSANE).

A typical nuclear plant is in the neighborhood of 1GW. So a typical nuclear plant might supply enough juice for _30_ concurrent o3 queries.

That is absolutely beyond the bounds of reasonable energy infra scaling if it's on the right scale of estimate.

OpenAI currently and will likely in the future offer multiple different models at different price points, and we’ve seen AI has the ability to massively reduce costs among existing models.

1hir24l,m3inrc8,OpenAI o3 is equivalent to the #175 best human competitive coder on the planet.,"I‘ve been a dev for 18 years. Most of my job isn’t coding, but it’s talking, planning, and aligning. There’s a tug of war from up to hundreds of directions, of various stakeholder and user needs to consider, acute priorities, tech considerations, and so many other human elements. 

You might think - can’t we replace all of them with agents. Definitely not: The software we make is being sold to humans, or does serve humans in the end. You can’t completely isolate the problem domain from the human element. And those buyers have better things to do than answer a million questions everyday that an agent might have. They delegate this to other humans, and they delegate again etc, and at the end of that chain you have designers and developers.
Maybe we‘ll need less developers eventually; but it’s just as likely that we‘ll build more software.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-24 00:08:21,Regular_Working6492
