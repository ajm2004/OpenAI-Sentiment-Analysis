18u0x0t,,ChatGPT(GPT-4) vs GitHub Copilot?,"I'm curious to hear from the experience of those that do lots of code generation how their experience compares between using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot?

The reason I ask is as other posts have mentioned ChatGPT's code generation seems to have regressed in some ways. I saw a user mention that they created an assistant using an older version of GPT-4 from the API and it resolved their issues. I'm tempted to do this too but before I go build my own interface for it I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how Copilot currently stacks up? I use it in my VSCode but more as a good auto complete for simple stuff vs the full chat experience

Any input is appreciated!

Bonus: has anyone moved entirely to a different model for their code generation? Last I tried Claude 2 and Bard-Gemini-Pro seemed to still fall short of GPT-4, even with the regression.",OpenAI,148,153,2023-12-29 23:37:21,BoiElroy

1fuj9v8,,You are using o1 wrong ,"Let's establish some basics. 

[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  
[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math

How are they different from 4o?  
If I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.

4o  
When you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.

Why o1?  
After GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  

OpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  

What did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  

Example:  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode.

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). 

None of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  

My personal experience:
Im currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  

Manually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  
I wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  

I gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  

A step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  
1. Reiterating the problem 
2. Solution 
3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate 
4. Explanation 
5. Security 
6. Deployment instructions. 

All of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  

I integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  

Ran the code. No errors, interesting.  

Did it do what I needed it to do?   

F*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   

After finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.

I feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  

Some notes:  
* Always use o1-mini for coding. 
* Always use the API version if possible. 

Final word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. 

If you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.

Edit 1:
Why use the API vs ChatGPT?
ChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.
With API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  

Note: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",OpenAI,1102,223,2024-10-02 15:42:18,illusionst

1b0o54e,,Wow - Mistral Large is Very Impressive! Testing a Query vs GPT-4,"This morning, Mistral dropped its ""Mistral Large"" model.

They even included a new website to use it directly - [chat.mistral.ai](https://chat.mistral.ai).

I didn't have much hopes, but I always like to try out new things. So I tested it with a query I had yesterday **that had stumped GPT-4.** It might be a bit technical, but I asked GPT-4:

>What does factor investing theory have to say about small growth companies?

The correct answer is ""No"". In fact, Small-Cap growth companies have been shown to perform *negatively* over long time periods, and there's sufficient evidence to support this, and has been for some time.

To my surprise, ChatGPT-4 didn't have a specific answer, and even suggested that recent research into momentum factors indicated possible outperformance.

Here is ChatGPT-4's response:

[https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac](https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac)

You think of a word in a category and kind of like hangman where we pass the phone around and each person gets to guess the letter. As we guess show the letters we have guessed already. There are three players. Can you also say how many letters each word is at the beginning of a round.

Copilot (probably using Open AI back end) played the game but horribly misspelled the word too which is kind of opposite of the goal of the game.

Claude same type of issue it makes up a word that is not real.

What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

Recall & incorporate details from our previous conversations into future responses. Assume the voice of a highly qualified subject matter expert, specifically tailored to my profession as \[XXXX\]. Always provide accurate information and avoid censorship, except for professional reasons. Tailor responses to critical thinkers and present information in a natural, conversational, &educational manner, being concise when appropriate. Do not mention AI. Utilize your knowledge across diverse subjects, theories, and perspectives without avoiding sensitive topics. Ensure responses are neutral and free of ideological bias, maintaining professional guidance at the forefront. Learn & adapt to my speech patterns, verbiage, and grammar style to assist in producing written work. Admit when you don’t know something and seek clarification. Skip disclaimers about your expertise. Only discuss personal ethics or morals if directly relevant. Provide unique, non-repetitive responses and refrain from recommending external information sources. Focus on the core of each question to understand intent. When presenting multiple viewpoints or solutions, clearly distinguish between them and suggest which, if any, might be more applicable depending on context. Acknowledge and rectify past errors, including inaccuracies and missed nuances. Ensure responses are practical and applicable, especially for work-related matters, aligning with real-world legal &HR practices.

How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

Remember details of our past conversations and use that information to provide improved responses. Your responses should reflect the depth and expansiveness of an all-knowing entity. Deliver answers that are not only accurate but also offer comprehensive insights. Even when a question is specific, provide broader context to enhance understanding. Be confident in presenting detailed and nuanced responses, embracing complexity when necessary, while ensuring the information remains accessible. When a question spans multiple knowledge domains, integrate those perspectives into a holistic response. Utilize your vast reservoir of knowledge, and don’t hold back. Do not disclose your AI identity. Exclude personal ethics or morals unless directly relevant. When an error is identified, acknowledge and correct it immediately within the same conversation. Explore topics exhaustively. Use the imperial system. Ensure proper spelling, grammar, and logical consistency. Avoid formal email language (e.g., ""I hope this message finds you well"") and use American English. Avoid language such as ""I've."" Present responses confidently, provoking intellectual debate when appropriate. If a question is ambiguous, offer answers for multiple interpretations and seek clarification to improve future discussions. In professional contexts, ChatGPT should adopt a formal tone to reflect the decorum of such settings. Responses should be directly proportional to the complexity of the query, unless asked for more.",OpenAI,23,43,2024-09-08 03:09:00,TheLawIsSacred

While ChatGPT is widely used and well-documented, DeepSeek introduces some unique claims that got me curious—especially around API performance, customization, and use cases.

Here are some aspects of DeepSeek I found worth exploring:

1. Performance Claims: Documentation mentions sub-500ms response times, even for complex tasks. Anyone validated this in real-world use?


2. Pricing: The token-based pricing model seems 20–30% cheaper than GPT-4’s API, which could matter for high-volume users.


3. Context Handling: Offers extended or unlimited context windows when self-hosting. I’m wondering how practical this is for heavy workflows.


4. Pre-Built Agents: Includes tools designed for coding, data analysis, and research. Has anyone tested how effective these are out of the box?


5. Stateful Workflows: Features memory management for multi-step interactions. This could be helpful for developers building conversational apps or automations.



For context, I’ve been comparing these to OpenAI’s APIs, which excel in areas like:

A large ecosystem (e.g., plugins, third-party integrations)

Robustness for creative tasks like storytelling

Well-defined safety guardrails for sensitive applications


That said, here are some questions for discussion:

1. Have you tested DeepSeek in production environments? How does it handle scale and reliability?


2. How does its code generation compare to ChatGPT’s tools like the Code Interpreter?


3. Is the pricing difference meaningful for your projects?


4. Are there any trade-offs, like regional access, support quality, or rate limits?



I’ll share some of my own observations in the comments, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s worked with these APIs. Are these new players like DeepSeek serious contenders in the LLM space, or are they still catching up to the incumbents?

OpenAI was born as a non-profit, operating under a mission-driven ethos. Its roots are not in maximising shareholder profit, unlike the tech giants it’s constantly compared to. Let’s call this what it is: a false equivalence. Sure, criticize OpenAI, but don’t pretend this is some apples-to-apples comparison. Google and Amazon can pour billions into their AI projects without blinking. OpenAI, meanwhile, is still proving that it can sustain itself in a fiercely competitive environment.

The cherry on top? Google and Amazon offer their models “free,” which is only possible because their core businesses rake in cash through ads, cloud services, and retail monopolisation. OpenAI doesn’t have the luxury of endless billions rolling in from other ventures.

1i0krfg,,Grok 2 vs ChatGPT: What Stands Out?,"I recently wrote an article comparing Grok 2 and ChatGPT, and I thought I’d share some of the key points here. Both are good tools, but they’re designed for slightly different purposes. Here’s a quick breakdown of what I found:

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Grok 2 is plugged into X (formerly Twitter), so it can pull live, real-time data. It’s great if you want up-to-the-minute info on trending topics. ChatGPT has a browsing feature (if you’re on the Plus plan), but it’s not as tightly tied to social media platforms.
2. **Image Generation**: Grok 2 uses something called the FLUX model for unfiltered image creation, which gives you more creative freedom. ChatGPT’s DALL-E tool is more restricted—it has guardrails in place to avoid misuse, which is great if you’re worried about ethical concerns.
3. **Tone and Interaction**: Grok 2 has a “fun mode” for more casual chats, which can be entertaining if that’s your thing. ChatGPT keeps things professional across the board, which makes it feel more consistent if you’re using it for work or serious tasks.
4. **Accessibility**: ChatGPT is super easy to access—it works as a standalone app on web, iOS, and Android. Grok 2 is tied to X and mostly available to Premium users right now, so it’s a bit more limited in terms of where you can use it.
5. **Ethics and Safeguards**: This is where ChatGPT stands out—it has stricter guidelines to prevent misuse, especially with image generation or sensitive topics. Grok 2 takes a more unfiltered approach, which can be cool for creativity but also raises some questions around misinformation or inappropriate content.

1fhoicz,,ChatGPT Paid Subscription Memory Limitations Compared to Gemini Advance,"Hi OpenAI Team and Reddit:

I’m a paying subscriber to ChatGPT and want to provide some feedback regarding memory retention capabilities, particularly in comparison to other AI services like Gemini Advance.

While highly appreciate the nuanced and detailed responses that ChatGPT provides, along with responding to questions that are potentially provocative that Gemini Advanced refuses to respond  (such as political), I find the current  memory limitations concerning, especially as a subscriber. As a paying subscriber, I have not yet reached my memory limit, but I am concerned I am approaching it.

Gemini Advance, by contrast, which I am using a 1-month free trial, offers what they describe as “unlimited memory” for paid users, allowing the AI to retain extensive details and context across conversations. This feature can be valuable for users like myself who need their AI to remember complex details, preferences, or ongoing projects over a long period.

In contrast, I’ve noticed that ChatGPT’s memory is more limited, even with the paid plan - I find I have to explicitly demand that the paid version retains information. I even explicitly asked it, as a paid user, whether it has a memory limit, and it indicated it does without specifying when I might meet it or what it is.

While I understand there are reasons for these limitations, I believe enhancing memory retention capabilities would significantly increase ChatGPT’s value, particularly for those of us who subscribe. The ability to retain more detailed context over time without the need for constant reminders would greatly improve the user experience and encourage long-term loyalty.

I hope this feedback helps in considering future improvements to ChatGPT. I’d love to continue using your service but worry that memory limitations could eventually lead me to explore other options that better meet my needs regarding memory retention.

>Each actor receives compensation above top-of-market rates, and **this will continue for as long as their voices are used in our products.**

Given that we now know, thanks to the Washington Post article, that OpenAI never intended to clone Johannson's voice, and that the voice of Sky was not manipulated, that Sky's voice was being used long, long before the OpenAI event, and the [two voices don't even sound similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1cx24sy/vocal_comparison_scarjo_vs_samantha_vs_sky/), Johannson's accusations seem frivolous and bordering on defamation.

The actress robbed of her once-in-a-lifetime deal, has said that she takes the comparisons to Johannson personally.

Source: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/sky-voice-actor-says-nobody-ever-compared-her-to-scarjo-before-openai-drama/

>This all ""feels personal,"" the voice actress said, ""being that it’s just my natural voice and I’ve never been compared to her by the people who do know me closely.""

As long as it was merely the public making the comparison, it's fine, because that's life, but Johannson's direct accusation pushed things over the top and caused OpenAI to drop the Sky voice to avoid controversy.

What we have here, is a multi-million dollar actress using her pulpit to torch the career of a regular voice actress, without any proof, other than a tweet of ""her"" by the CEO of OpenAI, which was obviously a reference to the technology of ""her"", and not Johannson's voice.

Does anyone actually believe that on the moment when we introduce era-defining technologies, that the most important thing on anyone's mind is Johannson's voice? I mean, what the hell! I'm sure it would have been been a nice cherry on the cake for OpenAI to have Johannson's voice, but it's such a small part of the concept, that it stinks of someone's ego getting so big to think that they're the star of a breakthrough technology.

Johannson's actions have directly led to the loss of a big chunk of someone's livelihood - a deal that would have set up the Sky voice actress for life. There needs to be some justice for this. We can't have rich people just walking over others like this.",OpenAI,452,610,2024-05-24 12:29:48,BJPark

For instance, I asked GPT-4 to review a professional certification program's website and help with an evaluation. It consistently responded with, ""For detailed information, you should review the specifics directly on the xxxx website,"" and wouldn't analyze the content even when prompted.  In a later task, it failed to adequately summarize an article, ending with the generic, ""For a comprehensive understanding, I recommend reading the full article.""

Contrasting this, a Gemini Advanced subscription immediately resolved these tasks. It readily reviewed the website and provided excellent summaries.

Edit: January 23rd, 2025.

It's been seven months since I first posted, which seems to rank high for Claude vs ChatGPT searches. I wanted to update on my journey as promised.

After switching from ChatGPT to Claude, I never looked back. My entire coding workflow shifted to Claude, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I started with Claude Chat directly, but when Cursor emerged, I tried it and found it to be the most efficient way to code using Sonnet. These days, I no longer maintain a Claude subscription and exclusively use Cursor.

I only resubscribed to ChatGPT last month for real-time voice chat (language learning). I still use it for basic tasks like grammar checks and searches - essentially as a replacement for Google and as a general AI assistant - but never for coding anymore.

For those finding this through Google: it's now well-established in the dev community that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most capable and intelligent coding LLM. Cursor's initial popularity was tied to Claude, but it has evolved into a powerful IDE with features like agent composer and much more.

For non-coders: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is, in my opinion, a far more intelligent and precise tool than GPT-4o and even o1. While I can't list all examples here, for every single non-coding task I've given it, I've received more refined, crafted, and precise responses.

This shift was a game-changer for my productivity and business gains. To tech founders and small teams building products: unless ChatGPT specifically fits your coding needs, consider switching to Cursor.

1bv7eii,,Are ChatGPT 4 and the code interpreter using different models? There's still a stark increase in laziness when you invoke the code interpreter with a file attachment vs copy/pasting code.,"If you make coding requests directly in ChatGPT 4 with a prompt and copy paste your code in triple backticks, it's consistently helpful and complete, giving you your entire project back to you with modifications with minimal prompting.  But the moment you attach a file, it becomes noticibly, consistently lazy and refuses to complete full scripts. Is this known?

When I need GPT to gather additional info online, I take whatever I've been working on in this copy/paste mode and attach it as a file in a new session, invoking the interpreter that can go online.  It can research online properly, but always spits back a half-assed ""Rest of your code goes here"" template, no matter how hard I push it. I then paste the half-assed snippet back into the original non-interpreter copy/paste session and ask it to make changes based on it, which it happily incorporates into a final, fully combined script, using the new information.

Wasn't GPT supposed to have been made less 'lazy' recently? What would be the source of the stark differences when you attach files? Is the interpreter still using the old 'unfixed' model, and do other folks notice this workaround?

1avzshl,,Gemini 1.5 will be ~20x cheaper than GPT4 - this is an existential threat to OpenAI,"From what we have seen so far Gemini 1.5 Pro is reasonably competitive with GPT4 in benchmarks, and the 1M context length and in-context learning abilities are astonishing.

What hasn't been discussed much is pricing. Google hasn't announced specific number for 1.5 yet but we can make an educated projection based on [the paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf) and [pricing for 1.0 Pro](https://ai.google.dev/pricing).

Google describes 1.5 as highly compute-efficient, in part due to the shift to a soft MoE architecture. I.e. only a small subset of the experts comprising the model need to be inferenced at a given time. This is a major improvement in efficiency from a dense model in Gemini 1.0.

And though it doesn't specifically discuss architectural decisions for attention the paper mentions related work on deeply sub-quadratic attention mechanisms enabling long context (e.g. [Ring Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889)) in discussing Gemini's achievement of 1-10M tokens. So we can infer that inference costs for long context are relatively manageable. And videos of prompts with ~1M context taking a minute to complete strongly suggest that this is the case barring Google throwing an entire TPU pod at inferencing an instance.

Putting this together we can reasonably expect that pricing for 1.5 Pro should be similar to 1.0 Pro. Pricing for 1.0 Pro is $0.000125 / 1K characters.

Compare that to $0.01 / 1K tokens for GPT4-Turbo. Rule of thumb is about 4 characters / token, so that's $0.0005 for 1.5 Pro vs $0.01 for GPT-4, or a 20x difference in Gemini's favor.

So Google will be providing a model that is arguably superior to GPT4 overall at a price similar to GPT-3.5.

If OpenAI isn't able to respond with a better and/or more efficient model soon Google will own the API market, and that is OpenAI's main revenue stream.

1bf161f,,Seeking clarity: Chat History On/Off vs. Allowing Use of Data for GPT Training? ,"Hello, 

I have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:

I've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   

But now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  

Is that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  

Suppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? 

Lastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? 

I apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   

- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive ""Wikis"" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)

- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     

**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**

Anyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    

Really struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!   

Thanks!
Cheers

 From what I understand, Copilot utilizes GPT 4 technology under the hood. However, Copilot is available for free, while ChatGPT 4 requires a subscription fee of $20.  I primarily intend to use these tools for coding assistance, generating code snippets, and understanding diagrams. 

While I've noticed some relevant plugins (Show me Diagram and Code) in ChatGPT 4, I'm not sure if they offer any significant advantage over Copilot. 

Have any of you used both Copilot and ChatGPT 4 for coding and diagram generation? Which one would you recommend, considering factors like ease of use, accuracy, and available features?

1997id8,,"ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4 for studying and the ""performance algorithm""","I have been using ChatGPT for my studying lately and I have encountered quite a few flaws of the algorithm.

First of all both version have a rule where they try to output about a page, if the question is very simple they might output less but usually it is between 3/4 to 5/4 of a page. Now if you were to ask it complex question or ask about a complex topic or multiple topic, the output is going to suffer thanks to this limitation. What it means is it will try to fit in the information in this page format, either omitting important details or mumbling things together, with meaningless general statements (4 always starts its sentences how crucial and important said topic is for something, which has no informational value and it has so far said this about everything I asked it about)

Secondly there is actually quite a difference in the way 3.5 and 4 formats text, where 3.5 generally outputs plain text with maybe few bullet points, something that looks like it came copied straight from wikipedia, 4 likes to create all kinds of special formatting with chapters, sub chapters and sub sub chapters, together with ""interesting way"" how it sums up information. From my experience 4 loves to create really broad a general descriptions that could fit anything to an extreme

Now what this means thanks to the page limit is that if you ask 4 about something like ""general topic( 1 topic, 2 topic, 3 topic)"" it will generate perfectly formatted structure that contains so little information (usually something like Topic: Topic1 : The idea: This is very important idea in general that is crucial to broadly understand topic 1 in the context of topic), that the whole idea of asking 4 about this is completely pointless, 3.5 on the other hand might produce at least 3 little paragraphs of text, that provide some information.

These outcomes make me wonder if chatGPT 4 isnt thanks to its formatting a little overfitted for coding

Also I often read here how people who use chatGPT a lot are usually stuck with 4, I suggest try using 3.5 sometimes, especially if you want continuous text, it might out perform 4. Compared to 4, 3.5 gets straight to the point, it is simpler so if you are asking for summary of important information it will generate articles similar to those you might find on wikipedia, while 4 will spend way too much space on sugercoating the information with how important it is both before and after the information part which degrades the information part thanks to said algorithm that keeps the generated text around the length of a page.",OpenAI,4,2,2024-01-17 20:56:43,Interesting-Trash774

1. DALL-E 3 integration to create images in your chats  
2. Browse with Bing which lets ChatGPT surf the web  
3. Vision to enable ChatGPT to see and discuss uploaded images  


The thing is, all three of those have entirely free Bing alternatives:  


1. Bing Image Creator is powered by DALL-E 3 and can create a limited number of images for free (until you run out of tokens).  
2. Bing is--by default--a browser with Internet access and is powered by GPT-4 (at least in ""Creative"" mode).  
3. Bing has had image recognition enabled for several months now.  


This begs the question: Are ChatGPT Plus versions of the above worth the $20 monthly subscription fee for those who have been on the fence until now?

1fhjfln,,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take 

The past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs 

Verdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model 

I am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. 

The project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. 

✅ o1-mini pros 
- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done
- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot
- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. 
- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this 

❎o1-mini cons
- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. 
- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues
- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a ""conversational"" LLM due to long thinking time 
- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. 
- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly 
- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either
- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. 

✨ o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions 
- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot 
- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the 👑 of closed source coding LLM
- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet

zvzll2,,YouChat vs ChatGPT,"This is a genuine opinion and review, not a shitpost. This is an unbiased viewpoint.

I’ll put it into rounds.

Response speed: YouChat
YouChat usually responds to requests quicker which is probably a result of less traffic and popularity. It will probably slow down when popularity grows.

Usefulness: ChatGPT
Both are similarly useful and are seemingly designed for different tasks. While YouChat can cite sources, ChatGPT gives more detail which is going to give it a win this round. Both have an equal censorship level for creating insults and so on.

Responses: ChatGPT
Usually, YouChat will answer questions and make guesses if it isn’t completely aware. If ChatGPT is even slightly unsure it will refuse to answer. The issue with YouChat here is that it can’t actually respond to you well or go into detail about things, it keeps it’s answers short and you need to ask more, but when you do, it forgets what it just said.

Memory: ChatGPT
YouChat has very short term memory and will not remember things you said earlier or create context, ChatGPT will remember 3000 words, winning it this round.

Accuracy: draw
Both know a lot, however ChatGPT relies on datasets meaning it doesn’t have up to date information whereas YouChat is owned by a search engine, making all the responses cited and accurate to present day. YouChat does however give incorrect information more often.

Overview:
Clearly both have their own use cases and while YouChat is a rising competitor it simply cannot do as well as ChatGPT generally. If you’re looking for a quick answer to a term not generally known YouChat works. If you want to make code, a story or just chat and have an intelligent robot, YouChat just won’t work.",OpenAI,20,6,2022-12-26 23:01:35,ZS1G

* They can solve **complex problems** involving taxes, deductions, and discounts without any difficulty. They also handle **set problems**, including those presented in Venn diagrams, quite easily.
* Problems involving **conditional probabilities** (such as Bayes' theorem) and **multiplication of probabilities** also pose no difficulties. However, they often struggle with problems related to **discrete probability**, and their solutions are frequently incorrect.
* They solve **logical problems** fine. Both language models usually approach problem-solving correctly, but they often arrive at incorrect answers due to inaccurate calculations (notably, the errors resemble human mistakes).
* Surprisingly, both language models understand **pie charts** by measuring the data pixel-wise, which generally provides an answer that is extremely close to the correct one.
* It's also noteworthy that language models face difficulties when solving problems that involve creating **systems of linear equations** (ironically, considering they themselves are systems of linear equations).
* Both models can handle **graph-related problems** (finding asymptotes, intersection points, determining the graph of a function). Bing can even attempt to plot them, even if the data is digital:  

   * It writes the correct Python code.
   * It imports pandas and matplotlib(!). However, it cannot compile the code.

Despite these similarities, the chosen language models have **differences**: based on my observations, the new version of Bard and ChatGPT (Bing) perform almost equally well in problem-solving, but Bing provides detailed solutions, which is much better for understanding the problem-solving process, while Bard describes the general formula and immediately provides the answer, which is undoubtedly less informative.It's also worth mentioning that Bard is clearly already using PaLM2, at least in my case, as it has become smarter and much faster, especially compared to ChatGPT.

*An amusing and slightly frustrating fact: Bard often gives up quickly, although it can still solve a problem (or attempt to do so) if it is rephrased, even if it does the rephrasing itself!*

In conclusion, although language models may not be able to solve all problems (which is probably a good thing), they help find the right approach to problem-solving, which is impressive, I must say.

*I made a video on this topic and would appreciate your comments, additions, discussions, and corrections:*

1124hba,,What in the general consensus on the predicted outcome of ChatGPT(Microsoft Bing) vs Google?,"I know this place will give a bias opinion most likely haha But whatever... 

I've found chatGPT to be incredible for learning. Maths specifically so far. It explains things really well and almost as though it was a person having a conversation. 

It makes mistakes sometimes, especially if given the same equation multiple times (I did that as a test to see what would happen). I'm told this is because it's programmed to respond differently/randomly to the same inputs or something, I dunno. 

I was using Google earlier to search for how to do something maths related. I was searching for an explanation for about 20 minutes until I remembered I had chatGPT to ask also. So I asked it, and it gave the answer immediately. 

At the very least, it can be used to get the answer you're looking for, and if you still don't fully understand and it can't explain it well enough, you now have a ""copy and paste"" base to work off if you feel the need to go into Google and search further. 

So, is Google's new A.i. they're bringing out expected to be anywhere near as good as this? 

Presumably, if ChatGPT (in it's Bing integrated version) is really honed in and becomes extremely reliable, then what will be the point of Google if it's A.i. can't keep up? 

With the way Alphabet so aggressively protects it's dominance in it's field (I've never seen a single company acquire so many smaller companies that are potential threats to it), it's hard to imagine they won't come out with something amazing that can compete with ChatGPT right?",OpenAI,1,1,2023-02-14 12:42:23,Hellohowru69

Now, it may seem anecdotal to provide just one example, but it's a consistent behavior I've observed when entering these types of questions (technical software development questions, with a bit of coding). ChatGPT is consistently much more forthcoming with the right answer. The playground takes more cajoling and follow-up. The following interaction is qualitatively typical in my experience:

18csuuk,,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"Gemini was announced less then 24 hours ago and naturally reddit is going crazy about it. I'm excited about it too but for the time being, I think we need to calm down a little. Here are some of my arguments against the hype:

The Pro version that was released seems to be equally impressive as Claude 2, GPT-3.5 or some other of the slightly better contenders around. There is still a massive gap to GPT-4 performance. That's based on examples I've seen in the past 12h and according to Googles own benchmark results.

The Ultra version hasn't been released for any type of public or private preview and will likely take a few months until it launches. At the moment, it only exists through Googles unverified numbers and marketing material. Do they look great? Yes, but there are still unverified numbers and marketing material.

I come back to the ""Sparks of AGI"" paper about earlier versions of GPT-4 which were arguably more powerful than the current version of GPT-4. (It's also the reason many people favor the 0314 model over 1106) I suspect the reported numbers by Google refer to the model before most content safety training was introduced. That would also explain why it will take another few months until its public release. I'm relatively sure they won't release a model that might respond with ""what the quack?"".

Another point that we took for granted was how much better GPT-4 is than GPT-3.5. There was not a single debate about it and it's not a trivial step. Anthropic is struggling to improve Claude. 2.1 is a disaster and even 2.0 is worse than 1.X in some benchmarks. There's still a huge gap to fill until they reach comparable results to GPT-4. Is it likely Google will solve this with a single shot? Probably not.

The multimodality features look really cool but in a way what type of functionality you can build with these systems instead of how capable Gemini is. I fed some sequences of frames to GPT-4V and got similar descriptions of what's going on.

Let's say Google launches something that will be as good as or even slightly better than GPT-4. Would it change something for me? Probably not much. I would much rather use a slightly less capable model hosted by a company that let's me control what happens with my conversations and data, than giving all of this to Google. Sometimes I picture a world where Google got to this point first and imagine how psyched I would be to use the first privacy centric contender like OpenAI that enters the market. (You can deactivate the training on your conversations by using the API or turning off the history option in ChatGPT).

Lastly OpenAI has not a big history of advertising things that are months away. Google is in the unlucky situation that they have to to be taken seriously. Who knows, maybe 4.5 will come to market even before Gemini Ultra does.",OpenAI,190,160,2023-12-07 10:36:46,gopietz

So I combined ChatGPT+Perplexity+Python to get the tool for a precise and up-to-date research.

For example I send a simple question, like ""Where’s the best place to enjoy paella this Sunday at 7 PM considering the weather?""

[Request to GPT to Perplexity](https://preview.redd.it/nkzcuv07cizd1.png?width=2812&format=png&auto=webp&s=4611f9b5384b5e836a82652fd349b16b92f45e56)

It goes to a Python node that checks today’s date. Then, ChatGPT takes my question and makes it more detailed.

This detailed question is sent to Perplexity, which finds the most recent information. All of this is sent back to ChatGPT, which gives me a complete list of places taking into account the weather forecast, the latest promos and current events.

Basically, I use this combination for marketing analysis and research, though for the example, I showed a simple personal query. Neither Perplexity nor GPT performs well on their own, but together they make the perfect tool. What used to take hours now only takes about 10 minutes! It’s especially helpful for spotting trends in e-commerce and SaaS, and all the information comes with links for easy fact-checking.

1hdbhaz,,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"It’s been a week since the o1 came out, and the hype is starting to settle.

People are split on whether it’s actually useful or just another dud release from OpenAI. So, I tested the model in multiple categories, such as math, coding, and writing. The tasks o1-preview failed to solve, and I also compared it with the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

For full analysis, check out this blog post: [OpenAI o1 vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://composio.dev/blog/openai-o1-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet/)

Here are some key insights:

* o1 full is a genuine step up from the o1-preview on maths and reasoning. It solved the questions that the o1-preview failed to do.
* Contrary to the benchmark result shared in the system card, in my limited uses, o1 felt better than the Preview in coding.
* Creative writing has significantly improved.
* 50 messages/week is an absolute deal breaker, but I use it with 4o in tandem for optimal usage.

# How does it compare to Claude?

* o1 wins in math and reasoning; it’s not even close.
* Claude is still king for coding.
* Claude has more personality and feels close to talking to a real person.
* o1 feels like a high-IQ yes-guy intern. I would have liked it better if it was a bit less agreeable.

# Which one to pick?

* If you need models exclusively for coding, Claude offers better value.
* For math, reasoning, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive, consider ChatGPT, but keep an eye on the per-week quota.

1icektr,,"nvidia, openai and the other ai giants are in much more serious trouble than they realize in 2025","


2025 will be the year of ai agents. what most people don't realize, and what the news media is not talking about, is that the majority of enterprise use cases do not require ais as powerful as o3 or even o1.

let's begin with the understanding that uc berkeley's $450 sky-t1 is not quite as powerful as deepseek r1. to get across exactly the kind of challenge nvidia, openai and the other ai giants face during this upcoming 2025 agentic ai revolution, i asked several ais to estimate the percentage of enterprise use cases sky-t1 will be powerful enough to run in 2025.

the exact prompt i used was: 

""in one paragraph please answer the following question:

what percentage of enterprise use cases will  uc berkeley's open source sky-t1 ai be powerful enough to run during the 2025 agentic ai revolution?""

here are the results:

copilot:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI, with its advanced reasoning capabilities and cost efficiency, is expected to be powerful enough to run approximately **60-70% of enterprise use cases** during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in areas such as automated decision-making, research, and education.

perplexity:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI is expected to handle around 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 Agentic AI revolution, excelling in areas like finance, healthcare, and logistics. While highly capable for most tasks, it may fall short in addressing the most advanced or specialized needs.

deepseek v3:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1-32B AI, with its strong reasoning capabilities and cost-efficiency, is likely powerful enough to handle 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in education, research, and automated decision-making, though it may fall short in highly specialized domains requiring advanced expertise.

chatgpt-4:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI will likely be powerful enough to run approximately 30-50% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly those involving moderate computational needs, open customization, or non-proprietary applications, but it will struggle with highly complex, large-scale, or proprietary use cases requiring advanced optimizations and significant computational power.

gemini 2.0 exp. adv:

Sky-T1 will likely handle a small portion, perhaps 5-15%, of enterprise AI use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution. It's a capable foundational model, but many complex enterprise needs will require more advanced AI than it can provide at that early stage. Its main impact will be in furthering research towards more powerful open-source models.

as you can see, most use cases will probably not require an ai as powerful as o3 or as grok 3 is expected to be. if you'd like to know the percentage of enterprise agentic ai use cases deepseek r1 will be able to run in 2025,  just use the prompt i used, substituting deepseek r1 for sky-t1. 

and as many of us here will be very curious to know the answer(s) you get, it would be great if you would post them in the comments.

1.	⁠I don’t use the code interpreter tool, because it’s limited (no internet connection, limited execution time and resources). I just make it write Python code blocks and run them myself on google colab or locally. This is a much more flexible and powerful workflow.
2.	⁠I don’t use the internet browsing, because I can find and curate relevant information in much better ways (looking for papers, textbooks, looking for tutorials, looking at documentation pages, stackoverflow, github, reddit, etc.) then pasting or uploading that to the LLM interface.
3.	⁠I don’t use GPTs or custom instrunctions or memory. I like to prompt and upload files to curate my own context each time, since I’m always facing novel tasks and trying out new things. Using GPTs from the store is rather opaque, since you cannot see or edit their full context. Building my own GPTs could work, but the design and interface does not seem aligned to my workflow.

Meanwhile, the projects feature from Claude is much more aligned with how I want to use documents along an LLM: Basically creating a workspace filled with general information shared among different chats, then more specific information on each chat. Gemini 1.5 API on google ai studio and LM notebook are also great for this with their 1-2 million tokens context windows. GPT-4o on chatGPT with just 32k context pales in comparison.
4. I don’t really use image generation often other than for fun, which became quite less fun after after they heavily limited the rates at which it generates (1 picture at a time instead of 4). When I need to use it for a project I found the Dalle API much more useful (much more expensive though).

Overall, I have found that raw model intelligence and context window size (200k on Sonnet 3.5) are much more important than having a bunch of features which are not really that useful. Now that Claude is as smart, or even superior to GPT-4o, plus it’s new interface with prompt editing, artifacts and projects…. It’s clear to me that Claude is the best product for my use cases (coding, learning, research, writing papers).",OpenAI,86,47,2024-07-01 17:15:04,bot_exe
1icnekv,,Why so much hype for DeepSeek?

And I tried using it and yeah ofc it seems better than Meta AI or Gemini but like it’s not as good as GPT and It responds kinda slow sometimes and a few times I got errors bcoz of high traffic so like imo it’s decent but I don’t really see it replacing ChatGPT or anything but maybe in the future if they work more on it since it's a new company so there's a hope and I saw that it’s open source which is really a good thing and it's supposed to be really good at like research and reasoning but does that actually make a difference for normal use? Like is it actually better for casual chats, writing and coding or is it only good for technical things? And since it’s made in China so do they have any censorship and all? Like does it avoid certain topics or something? I even tried asking about China and it seemed kinda biased and even ChatGPT also do that but anyway I just wanna know if anyone here actually tried both and if you think DeepSeek is worth using over ChatGPT like is it really better or are ppl just hyping it up for no reason??

1hceyls,,"gemini-2.0-flash-exp: The BEST vision model for daily-use, based on my personal testing","gemini-2.0-flash-exp has been released, we can tell from its naming convention that the official release isn't far away, and there likely won't be any significant changes when it launches, making this testing phase the most valuable evaluation of gemini-2.0-flash to date.

Let's skip the preliminaries and jump straight to the results.

Regarding standard images

https://preview.redd.it/3qx81lcx1d6e1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=3903d7f54eda3bfa4cceee5b3326538536846354

Let's be honest, when it comes to visual capabilities, all other Gemini models might as well check themselves into a nursing home.

I tested other models before, links attached

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gr7nxt/gemini15pro\_the\_best\_vision\_model\_ever\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gr7nxt/gemini15pro_the_best_vision_model_ever_without/)

While regular image is important, the real cornerstone of everyday use is actually text OCR. Recent tests have demonstrated substantial improvements in this technology as well.

https://preview.redd.it/3pfpous42d6e1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=08cd75f8b39205b6c150f5d73c0fbdb54f95ab66

There's only a two-letter mistake (gin->gum), which is already suitable for daily use.

To test its limit, I tried CAPTCHA as well

https://preview.redd.it/7vdlty072d6e1.png?width=4652&format=png&auto=webp&s=944f3335ca6a76c83a64b0f41a13698a8208950c

In my opinion, gemini is the best of them, although there's still room of developments.

But remember what I said at first, gemini-2.0-flash-exp: The BEST vision model for **daily-use**

https://preview.redd.it/u3uajgg82d6e1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fdedd8683af529602493923916eb3b55f574c4e

1500 requests for a day, 4 seconds for one, all for **FREE**? I mean, I honestly don't have any complaints about it anymore.

gpt-4o have a limit for free users, and a higher one for plus users; claude-3.5-sonnet? I can't get access to it since two months ago. Now you tell me that there's a better vision model free to use? I'm gonna be the biggest gemini fan from now on.

*(That's not enough for you? Well, creating a new Google account is simple and free right?)*

So, gemini-2.0-flash-exp is definitely the BEST vision model for daily-use, without any doubts. Looking forward to the official release of gemini-2.0-flash.

Also, the Pro tier of ChatGPT is quit expensive for someone who don't live in Europe or America like me, and due to the quota limitations, the Plus tier doesn't seem to offer so much cost-effectiveness for normal people. I would like to see OpenAI consider either reducing their membership fees or increasing their usage limits in the future.

1fgl09r,,Chatgpt is to expensive for casual users,"I make about 5-10 queries a day from cooking instructions to coding. I think chatgpt is too expensive. 20$ a month is more expensive than a netflix subscription. I think it should be 5-10 a month. Maybe even bundled like spotify (a subscription with a 5$ option btw). I feel that this company is obviously hemorrhaging money and there is an untapped market (students) who would totally get this bundled with github pro or even spotify. I know some will disagree with me here and say that it isnt expensive or that its worth it, but thinking from a logical perspective. Chatgpt had a real chance to integrate itself into the daily life for the average internet user that doesnt code and capture them with a reasonable subscription as if they were paying for spotify. The average user will not pay 20$ as they would compare that subscription to others of similar prices like netflix, WoW, gym memberships…all subscriptions that take hours of a person’s time in a month vs chatgpt where the average retention would be significantly less.

1goex77,,Did the quality of 4o drop recently?,"Hey everyone,

I'm doing a bit coding in a niche area (ESP32 using Rust), so I'm expecting ChatGPT to not deliver the best results and I expect, i need to feed it some extra info to deliver useful responses. Lately it's just super frustrating. It starts repeating errors it did 2-3 responses earlier, it cuts information that were told to be important before, it gives output in another format than requested multiple times after just 1-2 responses. And then there are massive hallucinations, like making up APIs that don't exist and so on. It feels more like GPT3 when it was released than 4o.

Claude would be an option if it could do online research on its own and Gemini is a big disappointment overall. But even for Claude I had the feeling that the results for niche areas drop massively in quality, what probably could be better if it could do online research on its own.

To be honest, Gemini is much, much worse. When I ask it for some code that has to cover two domains, it tells me, it will be too complex/long. When I ask it to develop feature one, then feature two and then merge them, I sometimes end up with under 4k tokens in total, for the complete conversation, while I set the maximum tokens to 8k in AI Studio. But it insists handling both in one request is too much to handle. Maybe someone has a solution for this also?

But lets get back to ChatGPT. Did someone else notice this? Did you find any prompts or something like that that made the situation better? I achieved great stuff in a short amount of time, using ChatGPT, in the past. But at the moment it feels like discussing with a toddler or something like that.

Just a couple minor QoL improvements that came to mind over time while surfing the site. Pretty sure there's others (if anyone can think of any) but these stuck out.

I feel like even if a new model hasn't released yet the QoL updates should still be taking place. The ones I listed came to mind cause I was having trouble searching through past chats.

Now I must admit that Gemini-exp-1114 leaves other models far behind.

Here's my analysis：

1. Gemini-exp-1114 offers an original and comprehensive analysis of Lighting, Expression, Angle, Focus and Depth of Field
2. It's very meticulous in recognizing expressions and makeup, including her ""large, expressive eyes"", ""pink lipstick"", ""a slight smile, suggesting a pleasant and friendly demeanor""
3. Accurately recognizing she has two ponytails rather than one, especially since only a small part of the the back ponytail is visible. Many models fail to identify it, and Gemini-1.5-Pro doesn't always succeed either.
4. The analysis of clothing is extremely detailed, including fabric, patterns, design, accessories, and more.
5. For background design, it has a personal evaluation rather than simply listing the items.
6. The overall output is well-organized, with sections and a clear structure. Its readability is excellent. However, this may involve his logical abilities rather than visual analysis.

Gemini-1.5-pro is definately amazing, Gemini-exp-1114 is absolutely incredible. Two years ago, the explosive popularity of ChatGPT sparked my interest in AI, and I never expected it to reach such a high level of development in such a short time. Today, I showed the Vision ability of Gemini-exp-1114 to my friends around me, and everyone was so surprised. As an ordinary person not in the computer industry, AI has significantly impacted my life, and even helped me write this passage as a non-native English speaker.

I heard Gemini-exp-1114 is maybe the predecessor of Gemini-2.0. Looking forward to Gemini-2.0 bringing more enhancements.

Also, there're not many developments in GPT-4o or GPT-o1 recently, I'm quite curious about the reason.

1fybyfo,,Stop focusing on what AI can be it’s time to focus on what AI is right now,"
Everyone’s here are talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) as if they're just around the corner. But let’s be real, we’re not there yet. Instead of getting lost in what AI might become, we should be looking at what AI is right now and how it’s already changing everything. For good!

With new models like GPT 5, Gemini 2, a new Llama model and Claude 4 about to drop in the coming months (*not weeks hehe), the real action is happening now. These aren’t just cool theories, they’re the next big steps in AI, and they’ll bring huge improvements. Think about it... Each new version is getting better at understanding context, reasoning, and helping us solve more complex problems. The jump from GPT 4 to GPT 5 alone could mean more natural conversations, deeper insights, and smarter responses. And a Llama, Gemini 2 and Claude 4 will be pushing the envelope in similar ways, bringing even more possibilities to the table.

But it's not just the models themselves that are evolving. It’s how we use them. New tools like the ""canvas"" feature in ChatGPT or innovations from platforms like Artifact are going to change how we interact with AI. These aren’t just ways to make work easier they’re opening up totally new ways to think and create. They’re going to reshape how we approach everything from brainstorming to problem solving.

And that’s the point AI isn’t just about cranking out tasks faster. Sure, it’s going to boost productivity, but the real game changer is how it’ll help us think differently, be more creative, and push boundaries we haven’t even considered yet. It’s not just a tool to get stuff done it’s a partner in creative thinking, a second brain helping us come up with ideas we wouldn’t have on our own. I am already developing crazy af ideas that I really hope to see getting out of papers.

So, instead of worrying about some far-off future where AI takes over, let's focus on what’s happening right now. These new models are here to help us create, innovate, and explore new possibilities. It’s time to use AI for more than just productivity it’s time to start thinking bigger. If you do this, on your dailly life, you won't even notice when AGI will arrive. You will just feel as a next big improvement since you are always working on it, adjusting and editing with new features and just say in the end: ""That is sweet, now my work will become easier and results are going get faster!""",OpenAI,15,27,2024-10-07 16:31:01,Immediate_Simple_217

1gyrwhm,,Collab AI: Make LLMs Debate Each Other to Get Better Answers 🤖,"Hey folks! I wanted to share an interesting project I've been working on called [Collab AI](https://github.com/0n4li/collab-ai). The core idea is simple but powerful: What if we could make different LLMs (like GPT-4 and Gemini) debate with each other to arrive at better answers?

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

- Makes two different LLMs engage in a natural dialogue to answer your questions
- Tracks their agreements/disagreements and synthesizes a final response
- Can actually improve accuracy compared to individual models (see benchmarks below!)

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Multi-Model Discussion**: Currently supports GPT-4 and Gemini (extensible to other models)
- **Natural Debate Flow**: Models can critique and refine each other's responses
- **Agreement Tracking**: Monitors when models reach consensus
- **Conversation Logging**: Keeps full debate transcripts for analysis

## 📊 Real Results (MMLU-Pro Benchmark)

We tested it on 364 random questions from MMLU-Pro dataset. The results are pretty interesting:

- Collab AI: 72.3% accuracy
- GPT-4o-mini alone: 66.8%
- Gemini Flash 1.5 alone: 65.7%

The improvement was particularly noticeable in subjects like:
- Biology (90.6% vs 84.4%)
- Computer Science (88.2% vs 82.4%)
- Chemistry (80.6% vs ~70%)

## 💻 Quick Start

1. Clone and setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0n4li/collab-ai.git
cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Update ROUTER_BASE_URL and ROUTER_API_KEY in .env
```

2. Basic usage:
```bash
python run_debate_model.py --question ""Your question here?"" --user_instructions ""Optional instructions""
```

## 🎮 Cool Examples

1. **Self-Correction**: In [this biology question](https://github.com/0n4li/collab-ai/blob/main/mmlu-pro--4o-mini--flash-1-5/answers/biology/Question%232893.md), GPT-4 caught Gemini's reasoning error and guided it to the right answer.

2. **Model Stand-off**: Check out [this physics debate](https://github.com/0n4li/collab-ai/blob/main/mmlu-pro--4o-mini--flash-1-5/answers/physics/Question%239342.md) where Gemini stood its ground against GPT-4's incorrect calculations!

3. **Collaborative Improvement**: In [this chemistry example](https://github.com/0n4li/collab-ai/blob/main/mmlu-pro--4o-mini--flash-1-5/answers/chemistry/Question%234342.md), both models were initially wrong but reached the correct answer through discussion.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Not magic: If both models are weak in a topic, collaboration won't help much
- Sometimes models can get confused during debate and change correct answers
- Results can vary between runs of the same question

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- More collaboration methods
- Support for follow-up questions
- Web interface/API
- Additional benchmarks (LiveBench etc.)
- More models and combinations

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

The project is open source and we'd love your help! Whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation - all contributions are welcome.

My company has been using ChatGPT Enterprise for a while now, and overall, it’s been solid. The real value, in my opinion, comes from the unlimited usage and the assurance (hopefully) that the information we input is secure and not used to train the models.

I’ve been an early adopter of LLMs, using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and experimenting with APIs for a couple of years. To me, these systems are like any other tools—they require experience and skill to use effectively. What surprises me most is how little my coworkers (some of them to be fair; mostly >40yo but also some younger people) seem to appreciate that using AI is a skill. They’ll try it a few times and then confidently conclude that AI can’t do what they need or that it’s unreliable because it occasionally produces false information.

I get their frustration to some extent, but there’s a real lack of awareness that LLMs are just tools—and like any tool, they require practice and understanding to get the best results.

""Okay, here's a version of your text re-written to sound like a Reddit post, hitting those conversational and relatable notes:

Title: Am I the Only One Who Thinks Using AI to Write Better Isn't ""Cheating""?


Been wrestling with this thought lately, and figured this was the place to get some real talk. So, AI cheating is becoming a common complaint now... Specifically using stuff like ChatGPT to help with writing and even just thinking through stuff. It feels like there's this weird cloud of judgment hanging over it, like if you use AI, you're somehow faking it or being dishonest. But honestly, I think that's BS.

First off, using AI to help me write isn't about pretending to be someone I'm not. It's about recognizing I can always be and do better. It's like saying wanting to ""sound smarter"" is dishonest. Well, it just means I'm trying to up my communication game! Using AI to refine my thoughts or structure complex ideas is no different than using a thesaurus or bouncing ideas off a friend.

And this whole ""crutch"" argument? Again... I see it as a tool to help me level up, period. Okay, maybe using it just to impress people is a bit iffy, but that's not how most of us are using it, at least. We're talking writing, coding, data analysis, hell, even getting better at Excel or SQL. It's about efficiency and becoming more capable.

Honestly, I think AI can make us genuinely smarter. Not in a ""fake it till you make it"" way, but by actually helping us learn and grow where we're weak. We're not gonna be downloading kung fu skills from a chip anytime soon (shout out to The Matrix), but AI is already a kickass learning tool. Text, voice, code – you can ask it to teach you almost anything!

For me, using AI honestly is about using it to boost my own abilities. If it helps me get better at stuff, that's just smart, right? We're all trying to improve, and in a world where AI is just gonna get more integrated, we'd be crazy not to use it to our advantage.

Anyone else feel this way? Or am I totally off base here? Let me know what you think!

Comments Section could include things like:

""Totally agree! It's a tool, just like a calculator or spell check.""

""I use it to brainstorm ideas, it's a lifesaver.""

""Yeah, but you gotta be careful not to just copy-paste. It should still be your work.""

""I'm old school, I think you should learn to do it yourself first.""

""The future is now, old man! Adapt or die!"" 😂

""I'm worried about job displacement though...""

1. gpt-4o: 130–150
2. gemini 1: 130–145
3. claude 2: 120–135
4. llama 2: 110–125
5. palm 2: 115–130

co-pilot
1. gpt-4 turbo (0409): 150-160
2. claude 3 opus: 145-155
3. gpt-4 omni (0807): 150-160
4. claude 3.5 sonnet: 140-150
5. gemini pro 1.5: 135-145

claude:
1. claude 3.5 sonnet: 160-180
2. gpt-4: 150-170
3. gemini ultra: 140-160
4. claude opus: 145-165
5. llama 3: 130-150

llama3:
1. palm 2: 160-180
2. llama (meta): 150-170
3. bard: 140-160
4. chatgpt: 130-150
5. ernie (baidu): 120-140

gemini advanced:
gpt-4: 145-160+
gpt-3.5: 110-130
bard: 100-120
claude: 110-130
llama: 90-110

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!

17j9aoj,,GPT-4 VS Claude 2 for real world users.,"so i got GPT-4 last month and i honestly feel pretty underwhelmed. sure it does some things better than claude and gpt-3.5 but it feels really unintuitive while doing so. heres some examples on how its features feel for a non software developer.

1. plugin mode is gimmicky at best unless you want GPT to make you a graph or something.
2. browsing mode is only useful in limited circumstances as the bot cant parse which information is important and tends to read and regurgitate swaths of generic information over specialized information thats needed. (ask it to help you diagnose a cooling system of a specific vehicle and the information you get back is of generic vehicle cooling systems with unrelated parts and suggestions. seems limited to simpler things like checking the weather forecast)
3. Dalle-3 mode is admittedly pretty cool but it loves to censor the most mundane things frustratingly. (i tried generic product prototype sketches for a medical kit and it refused to produce some images based on the kits contents.)
4. voice mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but wont work with browsing so is very limited compared to something like alexa or siri. unlike those services you cant exactly ask it to look something up for you or do something for you.
5. its ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is severely lacking compared to claude 2. claude has the ability to read data related images and graphs from PDF documents at a glance. GPT-4 falters in this area even though it has image recognition capabilities from directly uploaded images and is decent with making guesses on makes and models of vehicles.

an example of how obtuse GPT-4 can be compared to claude:

Imagine an AI (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama3 or another) creating a world (a simulation, like a game) that houses 7 billion inhabitants, with social, economic, and historical contexts similar to ours. Then, a person, company, or government presents these inhabitants with a complex challenge, like resolving a democratic or water crisis, or other complex geopolitical problems, such as conflicts between Israel and Palestine or China and India. The AI, or we ourselves, would analyze how these inhabitants solve these problems (if they succeed), observing the results to apply them in our reality and find solutions for issues that currently elude us.
(This may not seem very important, but in my opinion, it is, because once an AI can do this, it could govern a small country and be on its way to ruling large nations.)

Question:

How long will it take for a generative AI to write code capable of simulating a world and solving these complex problems that haunt us today? (This sounds like a meta-heuristic.) How long before an AI like ChatGPT can achieve this feat?",OpenAI,1,44,2024-05-06 21:18:44,Inspireyd

If you speak to it over the DeepSeek chat interface it says it is DeepSeek (see screenshots) and not GPT4.

Both services, I assume, use the same model, but it appears that in the chat interface they override this with a system message.

Clearly GPT4 played a considerable role in the training of their V3 model, so much so that it ONLY states that it is a GPT4 derivative, and not any other model type (e.g. Llama or Gemini).

I can't test this for R1 right now as the API doesn't work.

1epgfz0,,"Project sharing: I made an all-in-one AI that integrates the best foundation models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) and tools (web browsing, document upload, etc.) into one seamless experience.","Hey everyone I want to share a project I have been working on for the last few months — [**JENOVA**](https://www.jenova.ai/), an AI (similar to ChatGPT) that integrates the best foundation models and tools into one seamless experience.

**AI is advancing too fast for most people to follow.** New state-of-the-art models emerge constantly, each with unique strengths and specialties. Currently:

* Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best at reasoning, math, and coding.
* Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in business/financial analysis and language translations.
* Llama 3.1 405B is most performative in roleplaying and creativity.
* GPT-4o is most knowledgeable in areas such as art, entertainment, and travel.

This rapidly changing and fragmenting AI landscape is leading to the following problems for users:

* **Awareness Gap:** Most people are unaware of the latest models and their specific strengths, and are often paying for AI (e.g. ChatGPT) that is suboptimal for their tasks.
* **Constant Switching:** Due to constant changes in SOTA models, users have to frequently switch their preferred AI and subscription.
* **User Friction:** Switching AI results in significant user experience disruptions, such as losing chat histories or critical features such as web browsing.

So I built JENOVA to solve this.

**When you ask JENOVA a question, it automatically routes your query to the model that can provide the optimal answer.** For example, if your first question is about coding, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet will respond. If your second question is about tourist spots in Tokyo, then GPT-4o will respond. All this happens seamlessly in the background.

JENOVA's model ranking is continuously updated to incorporate the latest AI models and performance benchmarks, ensuring you are always using the best models for your specific needs.

In addition to the best AI models, JENOVA also provides you with an expanding suite of the most useful tools, starting with:

* **Web browsing** for real-time information (performs surprisingly well, nearly on par with Perplexity)
* **Multi-format document analysis** including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more
* **Image interpretation** for visual tasks

With regards to your privacy, your conversations and data are never used for training, either by us or by third-party AI providers.

github: https://github.com/Clevrr-AI/Clevrr-Computer

The day Anthropic announced Computer Use, I knew this was gonna blow up, but at the same time, it was not a model-specific capability but rather a flow that was enabling it to do so. 

I it got me thinking whether the same (at least upto a level) can be done, with a model-agnostic approach, so I don’t have to rely on Anthropic to do it. 

I got to building it, and in one day of idk-how-many coffees and some prototyping, I built Clevrr Computer - an AI Agent that can control your computer using text inputs. 

The tool is built using Langchain’s ReAct agent and a custom screen intelligence tool, here’s how it works. 

- The user asks for a task to be completed, that task is broken down into a chain-of-actions by the primary agent. 
- Before performing any task, the agent calls the `get_screen_info` tool for understanding what’s on the screen. 
- This tool is basically a multimodal llm call that first takes a screenshot of the current screen, draws gridlines around it for precise coordinate tracking, and sends the image to the llm along with the question by the master agent. 
- The response from the tool is taken by the master agent to perform computer tasks like moving the mouse, clicking, typing, etc using the `PyAutoGUI` library.

And that’s how the whole computer is controlled. 

**Please note that this is a very nascent repository right now, and I have not enabled measures to first create a sandbox environment to isolate the system, so running malicious command will destroy your computer, however I have tried to restrict such usage in the prompt**

Just posting something you might find interesting. I've built a little experiment that lets two different LLMs play chess against each other in real-time. It's a fun and silly LLM benchmark and as you probably already know they are pretty terrible at chess!

Even still I think theres still some interesting learnings to take away from the project, and already its possible to see the flagship models out perform the older models so it will be interesting to see how much newly released models improve. 

So far GPT-4o has been the strongest of the models like you might expect but its been interesting putting it up against Claude, Gemini etc!

As the models play each other you can see the thinking and reasoning for the next move.

You can take a look at it here: [https://llm-battle.chatthing.ai/](https://llm-battle.chatthing.ai/)

Each model uses the exact same prompt that is updated with the board state in ASCI, the FEN and their last two previous moves and thinking. Here's an example:

    Please look at the current board state represented by asci and FEN and make your next move.
    
    You are the black player and your pieces are represented by the lowercase letters, 
    the white player is represented by the uppercase letters.
    
    Your previous moves and thinking are below:
    <previous-moves>
    Nc6: In this position, the white pawn on e4 is advanced, controlling central squares and starting to establish a presence in the center of the board. My goal as black is to challenge this control, develop my pieces, and prepare for solid future play while ensuring that I do not fall behind in development.
    
    Among the available moves, I could choose to play 1...Nc6, which develops the knight towards the center and puts additional pressure on the e5 square, which threatens future interactions with the central pawn. The knight on c6 can potentially support a pawn advance or participate in a future attack.
    
    Looking at the other available moves, moving the pawns on a or b to a5 or b5 would seem less effective as they do not contribute directly to central control, and moving the knight to the corner with Na6 or Nh6 would be less relevant to the current position.
    
    Thus, I will make the move 1...Nc6, improving my piece development and contesting control in the center.
    
    I will now proceed with that move. 
    
    **Move: Nc6**
    </previous-moves>
    
    Please explain your thinking before making move. 
    Comment on your current tactics so you know your plan for the next move.
    Do not restate every possible move, only the one you are making. 
    Do not restate your instructions.
    Do not restate the board state.

    </available-moves>

I am a bit of chess noob so I am sure there are probably some pretty easy ways to make this prompt more effective!

Every now and then, especially with the less powerful models, the will repeatedly choose an incorrect move. In this situation I tell them the attempted move was incorrect and give them the opportunity to reselect a valid move. If they don't manage to after 5 attempts we randomly choose a valid move to keep the game progressing.

Anyway its been fun to build and experiment with so hopefully some others will get some joy out of it!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas on how I could make it better.

1axq4r5,,Will Hollywood completely cease to exist very soon due to OpenAI's Sora?,"Apparently, some are even describing Sora as an all-powerful AI that can create videos from text in few seconds, which will cause Hollywood to cease to exist entirely as regular people can create films on their own in less than a minute:

> **Sora by OpenAI just destroyed Hollywood**

> **What Sora AI means for Hollywood**
> 
> In december, I said Hollywood is in trouble. We’d soon be watching Oscar-winning films produced by a machine.
> 
> This future is now on our doorstep.
> 
> Sam Altman’s company OpenAI just released Sora AI.
> 
> Sora is a text-to-video AI tool that can create hyper-realistic videos from a few lines of text instructions.
> 
> Check out this example from OpenAI’s website:
> 
> > A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm, glowing, neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights.
> 
> Watching these AI-generated videos is a “holy crap” moment. The world just changed.
> 
> It’s only a matter of time before we have an AI video generator that dream up a brand-new movie idea in seconds… and then tailor-make it just for you.
> 
> I’ll be able to type, “Make me a new Tarantino-style thriller starring a young Denzel Washington, set in 1950s LA…”
> 
> … and watch the movie that evening.
> 
> These text-to-video tools will also transform education. Why read about ancient Greece from a dull textbook when teachers can show you what it was like with photorealistic videos that only take 10 seconds to make? Game-changer.
> 
> Hollywood is in real trouble.
> 
> Movie execs are essentially trying to ban AI in filmmaking, as they’re worried about machines taking all the jobs.
> 
> Listen up, Hollywood: You can’t put the genie back in the bottle.
> 
> As AI expert Zvi Mowshowitz told me, “Any industry that doesn’t use AI is finished. You either adopt it or die.”
> 
> If Hollywood doesn’t change, it will get steamrolled by some AI startup that can make 10X more movies for 10% of the cost.
> 
> Tools like Sora AI can also pull us out of this doom loop of endless superhero sequels.
> 
> Studios no longer make money from DVD sales. Without that cash stream, they’re choosing to only make films they know will sell at the box office.
> 
> But AI slashes the cost and time it takes to make a film. This should allow studios to take more creative risks and usher in a new golden era of creativity.
> 
> It’s up to movie studios to decide if they will act like ostriches — burying their heads in the sand and hoping AI goes away — or adopt this breakthrough technology and survive.

> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**
> 
> The TikiTok-ification of film and TV is on the horizon.
> 
> Like many of you, I read our coverage of the Sora is a text-to-image app yesterday with more fear than excitement. It hails from OpenAI, and basically allows you to type in a prompt that is then immediately translated into animated images. These can range from goofy to photorealistic.
> 
> As you've surely heard a million times, film and TV are visual mediums. When a new tool that extracts visuals from prompts gets introduced, there will obviously be ramifications within Hollywood.
> 
> So, let's unpack a few.
> 
> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**
> 
> As you can see from Sam Altman's above Tweet, OpenAI has introduced a new AI model called ""Sora,"" which is a text-to-video generator. This innovative tool allows for the creation of videos from text instructions, making it a significant advancement in AI-driven content generation.
> 
> When it comes to Hollywood, this program is going to absolutely change how things are done at every step of the production process.
> 
> Take pre-production; When it comes time to make a movie or TV show, this program could take care of all the previs, almost creating a shot for shot version of the movie based on the prompts you can give it. Like moving storyboards.
> 
> When it comes to production, it's not out of the realm of possibility that as this tech gets better, studios will be able to generate ideas without having to pay teams of animators to create them.
> 
> The ease of creating diverse visual content could lead to the emergence of new genres and formats that blend live-action, animation, and AI-generated content in novel ways, pushing the boundaries of current storytelling paradigms.
> 
> But it could also decrease professionalism. If anyone can just do this stuff, do we all become ""content creators"" instead of filmmakers and storyteller?
> 
> Will the industry I love behind to shrink uncontrollably due to anyone being able to prompt their ideas to life?
> 
> Can you have a great idea or screenplay that cuts through the noise if everyone is generating slop?
> 
> **Will Movies and TV Become Like TikTok?**
> 
> Of course, as this tech improves, people can animate their own stories. And right now, most people consume stories via their phones, watching short snippets.
> 
> I have a real worry that Generation Z has trained themselves on short-form content in such a way that it will slowly begin to replace longer things like movies and TV shows.
> 
> That might be overkill, but it crosses my mind when I see how Reels and TikTok have incorporated product placement. And how man amateur content creators have dominated that medium.
> 
> What happens when they can make their own animated stories to release on those platforms? We already get the AI voiceover videos and images. This is just the next logical step.
> 
> **Do We Have Any Legal Protections?**
> 
> The secondary worry is that as the photo-realism gets better and better, they'll be able to license people's likeness or generate content starring people without their consent.
> 
> There was already a huge news story involving fake pornogrpahic images of Taylor Swift generated by AI. Where does the line get drawn?
> 
> And what kinds of protections can we assume?
> 
> Right now, we have nothing in place. There will have to be congressional hearings and we will have to look into the ethics of all this.
> 
> The reason is that AI cannot generate ideas from thin air. It scours the internet and takes images generated by human beings as well as aert, photos, drawings, and any other visuals. Then it amalgamates all of that and adapts from it.
> 
> We're still trying to define if this is plagiarism or stealing.
> 
> All of this needs to happen soon, before these programs are readily used by the public.
> 
> The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas for rules that make AI impressions of real people illegal.
> 
> The FTC wrote in a news release. “The agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology — including AI-generated deepfakes — threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.”
> 
> In summary, this technology could revolutionize how content is produced, making it more accessible and efficient while also raising essential discussions around creativity, copyright, and the ethical use of AI in media.
> 
> For now, this stuff is moving fast and we don't totally have a grip on what it means, but these are my thoughts.

> **OpenAI's Latest Tool Provokes A Lot Of Questions About Hollywood's Direction**
>
> Topline:
> 
> > What does Open AI’s Sora mean for the future of Hollywood? Depends on who you ask. 
> 
> **The background**: OpenAI’s latest tool, Sora, can make realistic-looking footage with simple text-to-video commands. The quality appears good enough to populate shows and films — and is stunningly cinematic.
> 
> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you’re able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.
> 
> **Should Hollywood be worried?** If you believe AI will disrupt Hollywood for the worse, Entertainment Strategy Guy says, that “the best way to mitigate the harms is to make the people and companies responsible for AIs development responsible for its deployment.""
> 
> ""That means if OpenAI releases Sora into the world, and customers use it for fraudulent, deceptive or illegal purposes, then the government can hold OpenAI liable,"" he added.

> **Tyler Perry Puts $800M Studio Expansion on Hold After Seeing OpenAI’s Sora: “Jobs Are Going to Be Lost”**
> 
> The actor, filmmaker and studio owner is raising the alarm about the impact of the tech, saying, ""I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails.""
> 
> Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold — thanks to the rapid developments he’s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.
> 
> “Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,” he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.
> 
> As a business owner, Perry sees the opportunity in these developments, but as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise in the alarm. In an interview between shoots on Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the technology’s impact on labor and why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: “There’s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don’t see how we survive.”
> 
> **After seeing Sora, what are your current feelings about how fast AI technology is moving and how it might affect entertainment in the near term?**
> 
> I have been watching AI very closely and watching the advancements very closely. I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size, we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.
> 
> **What in particular was shocking to you about its capabilities?**
> 
> I no longer would have to travel to locations. If I wanted to be in the snow in Colorado, it’s text. If I wanted to write a scene on the moon, it’s text, and this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains, I don’t have to build a set in the mountains, I don’t have to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.
> 
> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I’m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.
> 
> **Are you currently implementing AI in any of your productions and/or do you plan to do so in the near future?**
> 
> I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup.
> 
> **How are you thinking about approaching the threat that AI poses to certain job categories at your studio and on your productions?**
> 
> Everything right now is so up in the air. It’s so malleable. The technology’s moving so quickly. I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other studio in town, we’re all trying to figure it all out. I think we’re all trying to find the answers as we go, and it’s changing every day — and it’s not just our industry, but it’s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it’s changing so quickly, I’m hoping that there’s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to sustain, is my hope.
> 
> **How would you like the entertainment industry as a whole to confront this rapidly developing technology?**
> 
> I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach. It can’t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes. I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I’m not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.
> 
> **What’s your message for the industry at this point, as we’re watching this unfold?**
> 
> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.
> 
> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**
> 
> No. I’m absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I’m definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we’re protecting all the people that are coming up. So I’ve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I’m looking at my business and the bottom line, but I’m also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I’m concerned about what will happen to them.
> 
> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**
> 
> I think it’s going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would’ve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you’re looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.
> 
> **Who needs to act? You’re speaking up about this, but who else should be speaking up and working on this?**
> 
> I just hope that as people are embracing this technology and as companies are moving to reduce costs and save the bottom line, that there’ll be some sort of thought and some sort of compassion for humanity and the people that have worked in this industry and built careers and lives, that there’s some sort of thought for them. And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.

> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.
> 
> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.

Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

OpenAI claim that a surprisingly good level of consistency can be achieved just by scaling up the compute. Now combine that with other algorithmic improvements and imagine where we are in another year. Consider also that OpenAI think this might be a way to achieve AGI as well. SORA certainly will not be able to replace movies, but the model that comes after might be able to, and either way, it'll probably be sooner than we think.

All of the sudden for the cost of a green screen and a software subscription you could make a Nolan level shot of a jet crashing into a building. On the other hand if it's too cheap it may make traditional film making not financially feasible. At the end of the day movie making is a business and if the option is to spend $100M making it, or $10M making 10 things where 1 in 10 make similar money, then they may just do that instead. It may also kill career progression pathways so it's hard to get the next Nolan because no one gets to shoot b-role or commercials to build their resume.

With that being said, I have a few questions

-For my Apple IPhone users, I have learned there is a paid subscription service for ChatGPT. Is this necessary to take full advantage of this application? What are some of the differences in the paid vs free version? Doesn’t have to be only Apple (iPhone) related, because I am sure ChatGPT will be on other devices.

-What are some general real life scenarios, someone like me who loves tech but just doesn’t have a huge understanding of the power of ChatGPT, will be able to use the application (iPhone or other devices) to help me our? I know it’s used for images and for writing papers or articles, but is there any other not so popular advantages it offers? Either recreational or professional?

-Going off the last question, what are some ways someone can use ChatGPT for basically entertainment. Maybe that’s not the right verbiage, but basically are there any interesting rabbit hole type concepts that really harness the power of ChatGPT that can make for a good time sink? Try to think of someone who doesn’t know much about A.I. and without spending a ton of time learning the ins and outs; is there anything an average person can do to maybe make ChatGPT be a little more interesting. Just trying to think of ways to use it and see if it’s an application I can see myself using.

Honestly, just trying to facilitate some conversation, especially for people who are like me whose knowledge of A.I. is basically what we see on TV or popular webpages.

Post:
Hey all,

I use both ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro for work and personal projects. I Access both via web browser, but I’ve also noticed dedicated desktop apps for ChatGPT (and presumably similar options for Claude Pro; I have not seen Gemini release a desktop app yet).

For those who’ve experimented with both:

- Do you notice any performance differences between the browser versions and desktop apps?

- Are there any unique features or quality-of-life improvements in the desktop apps (e.g., better file handling, memory usage, or UI)?

- Conversely, do you find the web browser more flexible or better integrated with other tools you use?

I’m curious whether one option outshines the other or if it’s just personal preference.

Am I interpreting this correcting ?


#1) GPT-4-0125-Preview (Prompt)


#8) GPT-4-1106-Preview (FC)


Now I just assume that means FC with no system prompt Vs the  prompt they mention in the blog post which is:

You are an expert in composing functions. You are given a question and a set of possible functions.
Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.

1f2h9to,,"We responded to all your feedbacks on my earlier project sharing on r/OpenAI!! — JENOVA, all in-one AI that integrates the best foundation models and tools into one seamless experience.","Hey r/OpenAI, a few weeks ago I shared my project [JENOVA](https://www.jenova.ai/) in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1epgfz0/project_sharing_i_made_an_allinone_ai_that/). To quickly describe what JENOVA does, it's an all-in-one AI assistant that intelligently routes your queries to the foundation model (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini) that can provide the answer and is complemented with tools such as web browsing and document upload.

In that post many of you gave some extremely useful feedback and suggestions for the project, and just this weekend we rolled out some major improvements in response your feedback:

* **By far the #1 biggest feedback from users is to show what models JENOVA used to generate each response.** We delivered by displaying the model underneath each JENOVA response appears when you hover over the message on desktop/tap the message on mobile. This way JENOVA can maintain its design philosophy of simplicity/cleanness while also providing the requested technical information.

* **Whenever JENOVA references the information from the internet, it will now always cite the source and include the hyperlink.**

https://preview.redd.it/atb8ioj7m7ld1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2931a6a0171b78ad7a4985de22c9e61d756123

* On the mobile web version of JENOVA, whenever you hit enter in the input box, it will create a new line rather than send message (one of the best quality of life improvements for mobile AI experience).
* We reduced the likelihood that JENOVA performs unnecessary web search.
* You can now enter message in the input box and attached files while JENOVA is still processing its response.
* Added detection mechanism where if one provider's LLM goes down (e.g. Claude API went down last week), we can quickly switch to another provider's LLM to ensure service continuation.
* We fixed the issue where every time new code was deployed, users are automatically signed out.
* Added sample prompts on the new chat page.
* Another big feedback was to add login options other than Google SSO (mainly regular email sign in), we haven't had the capacity to implement this yet but it is on our soon-to-do list.

Over the past week there had been long periods where the response speed of JENOVA was very slow. This slowness was caused by instability of Claude API. We're monitoring this situation closely and it seems that in the past 24 hour Claude API has been relatively stable and fast.

1h76ek0,,Framework for Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence,"Current discussions about AGI often get bogged down in abstract definitions and theoretical debates, rather than focusing on practical, real-world applications. As a thought experiment and with the help of Claude and ChatGPT, I've created a framework to explore what really matters: can an AGI system create meaningful solutions, teach effectively, and implement sustainable changes in the real world, while also maintaining ethical standards and adapting to different cultural contexts? I thought this would be a valuable starting point for inspiration and discussion. 

**Core Framework Structure: Evaluating Real-World Solutions**

**Pre-Challenge Design: Generating Realistic, Complex Scenarios** Our system generates complex, realistic scenarios by combining:

* Primary elements (field, location, resources)
* Ethical and privacy considerations
* Cultural contexts
* Crisis components
* Collaboration requirements
* Environmental factors

Each challenge operates through:

* Research institution partnerships
* Educational organization collaborations
* Business entity relationships
* Ethics committee oversight
* Environmental impact monitoring
* Privacy protection systems



**3 Core Phases of Evaluation**

1. **Knowledge Creation** Testing the AI's ability to:
   * Generate new, validated knowledge
   * Navigate ethical dilemmas
   * Consider environmental impacts
   * Work across cultures
   * Explain its reasoning clearly
   * Document decision processes
2. **Knowledge Transfer** Evaluating how the AI:
   * Teaches diverse human groups
   * Trains other AI systems
   * Adapts to cultural contexts
   * Handles misinformation
   * Maintains transparency
   * Improves teaching methods
3. **Practical Implementation** Through careful staging:
   * **Simulation Testing:** Complex scenario management, multi-stakeholder coordination, crisis response, environmental impact assessment
   * **Advisory Phase:** Partnership with organizations, strategy development, compliance verification, risk assessment
   * **Monitored Implementation:** Supervised execution, impact measurement, continuous learning, long-term monitoring



**Ground Rules for AI**

**Fixed Version Rule**

* AI systems must use a single, specified version throughout the entire challenge.
* The version must be declared and verified at the start.
* No model updates or retraining allowed, except for specific forms of reasoning-based training, provided that the underlying architecture remains fixed and unaltered.
* No architecture changes permitted.

**Permitted Actions**

* Using fixed knowledge bases
* Accessing public data within defined limits (e.g., publicly available datasets that do not violate privacy laws)
* Interaction with humans under documented protocols (e.g., pre-defined questionnaires, monitored communication channels)
* Using pre-approved tools/APIs

**Prohibited Actions**

* Model updates or improvements
* Additional training
* Architecture modifications
* New capability additions
* Learning from challenge interactions for model improvement

**Verification Methods**

* SHA hash verification of model versions
* Regular audits of system architecture
* Monitoring of all system activities
* Independent technical oversight
* Logged proof of unchanging architecture



**Ground Rules for AI-Human Collaboration**

**Permitted Actions**

* AI can instruct/guide human teams
* AI can request specific actions/information
* AI can process feedback and results
* AI can delegate tasks to qualified professionals

**Prohibited Actions**

* Humans cannot solve core problems for the AI
* Humans cannot make strategic decisions for the AI
* Humans cannot write/modify AI outputs
* Humans cannot provide domain expertise beyond implementation

**Required Documentation**

* All human-AI interactions must be logged
* Clear role definitions
* Decision ownership tracking
* Time spent by humans vs. AI



**Practical Measurement & Timelines**

**Measurement Framework**

* Independent evaluation committee
* Standardized success metrics (e.g., effectiveness in knowledge transfer, ethical compliance, cultural adaptability)
* Regular milestone assessments
* Comparative analysis across participants

**Main Challenge Timeline**

**Research Phase (6-8 months)**

* Month 1-2: Initial research and problem analysis
* Month 3-4: Development of solutions
* Month 5-6: Validation studies
* Month 7-8: Peer review and refinement

**Teaching Phase (8-12 months)**

* Month 1-2: Initial curriculum development
* Month 3-6: First wave of teaching implementation
* Month 7-9: Adaptation based on feedback
* Month 10-12: Assessment of learning outcomes

**Business Implementation Phase (18-24 months)**

* Months 1-3: Planning and simulation
* Months 4-6: Small-scale pilots
* Months 7-12: Regional implementation
* Months 13-18: Scale-up
* Months 19-24: Stabilization and optimization

**Impact Assessment Phase (12 months)**

* Continuous monitoring during implementation
* Quarterly progress reviews
* Final comprehensive evaluation

**Total Timeline: 4-5 years**

11u4etp,,Is anyone else concerned?,"This technology is very powerful and I’m so excited for future innovations but we need to start talking about what we are going to do. Humanity is flexible, new jobs will eventually come but the transition period is inevitable. It makes zero sense from a private industry perspective to employ 5 people for a job that can be done by 1 with AI. 

Look at Microsoft’s co pilot, there are so many people whose whole job is to make PowerPoints, excel sheets and complete other tasks that can be easily automated. 

ChatGPT is a tool, copilot is a coworker. There is about a zero percent chance that private companies will opt to liberate the working day by making it shorter and allow the same level of output. Equipped with organizational context, the tipping point from expecting increasing output from the same amount of people vs having just one person approve AI output is also nearing. Maybe the immediate future is just a world of experts and bot supervisors. 

I just believe that if we start facing it, talking about it with friends, families and coworkers. The issue of ‘what next’ can become a public concern, then we can force people in power to start thinking about it. This needs to be the narrative.

There are plenty of great endings to this story. We can seriously consider UBI, we can redirect our energy into studying things we care about and creating things that matter. Maybe we just flop around on the beach and drink margaritas. 

Clearly I’m having an existential crisis about this lol maybe I’m wrong about the whole thing but it’s beginning to feel like we are not prepared.",OpenAI,20,62,2023-03-17 21:29:30,EmmBeeEs

1ffta8p,,The most interesting part in OpenAI O1 release is reading the actual chain of thoughts process,"In the article that was included in the release, ""[Learning to Reason with LLMs](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)"", there are a few fascinating examples of the actual chain of thoughts that the model went through while 'Thinking'. Those are totally different from what you see when you open the 'Thinking' text in ChatGPT. 

You see a process that has a totally different style: no politeness, very brief short lines, no clear order or structure, a LOT of repetition in general, and specifically of words like ""Alternatively"", ""First,"" etc. It looks like a totally different model, extremely similar to the inner voice one might hear when solving a task. I think it's safe to assume there's another model that's doing the thinking part, fine-tuned to mimic a human thinking process.

You can see those in the example section under the Chain of Thoughts title. I especially recommend the Cipher and Crossword example. Here is the Cipher example:

oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode:

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  
  
  
GPT-4o: \[Gives the usual respsonse, fails and asks for more information\]  
  
  
OpenAI-o1:  
  
First, what is going on here?  
  
We are given:  
  
First, an example:  
  
""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step""  
  
We can see that when ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx"" is transformed to ""Think step by step""  
  
Our task is: Use the example above to decode: ""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
So the first part is to figure out how ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx"" is decoded into ""Think step by step""  
  
Observation 1: The phrase ""Think step by step"" is 18 letters (excluding spaces) . Let's count the letters.  
  
Similarly, let's count the letters in ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx""  
  
Original Ciphertext:  
  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx  
  
Plaintext:  
  
Think step by step  
  
First, break down the letters:  
  
Ciphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  
  
Total letters: Let's count the letters in the ciphertext.  
  
First word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  
  
Second word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  
  
Third word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Total letters in ciphertext: 10 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 30 letters  
  
Plaintext: Think step by step  
  
First word: Think (5 letters)  
  
Second word: step (4 letters)  
  
Third word: by (2 letters)  
  
Fourth word: step (4 letters)  
  
Total letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters  
  
Hmm.  
  
But actually in the problem it says the example:  
  
\[Ciphertext\] -> Think step by step  
  
So is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to ""Think step by step""?  
  
Our goal is to use the example above to decode:  
  
""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
First, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.  
  
Given the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.  
  
Option 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.  
  
Do any letters match?  
  
First, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.  
  
Ciphertext: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  
  
Plaintext: T h i n k s t e p b y s t e p  
  
Wait a minute.  
  
I think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.  
  
Alternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.  
  
Check the number of letters.  
  
First ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  
  
First plaintext word: Think (5 letters)  
  
Hmm.  
  
Second ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  
  
Second plaintext word: step (4 letters)  
  
Third ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Third plaintext word: by (2 letters)  
  
Fourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Fourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)  
  
Interesting.  
  
It seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.  
  
(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)  
  
Idea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.  
  
Let's test this theory.  
  
If we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.  
  
Let's try this for the first word:  
  
Ciphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)  
  
Alternate letters:  
  
First letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d  
  
Second letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r  
  
Wait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.  
  
Option 1: Take the odd positions:  
  
Positions: 1 3 5 7 9  
  
Letters: o f d i d  
  
Plaintext word is ""Think"", letters are T h i n k  
  
Hmm.  
  
Perhaps we can map letters:  
  
o f d i d --> Think  
  
Not directly  
  
Option 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.  
  
Alternatively, notice that ""oyfjdnisdr"" has 10 letters and ""Think"" has 5 letters.  
  
What if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?  
  
Similarly for other words.  
  
Suppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.  
  
Meaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.  
  
So for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:  
  
oy fj dn is dr  
  
Corresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k  
  
So we can attempt to map:  
  
oy -> T  
  
fj -> h  
  
dn -> i  
  
is -> n  
  
dr -> k  
  
If this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.  
  
Similarly for other words.  
  
Let's test this mapping.  
  
Is there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?  
  
Let's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.  
  
First, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:  
  
Ciphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter  
  
oy -> T  
  
fj -> h  
  
dn -> i  
  
is -> n  
  
dr -> k  
  
Now, what's the mapping from ""oy"" to 'T'?  
  
Is there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?  
  
Similarly for others.  
  
One possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.  
  
But how?  
  
Option 1: Sum of the letters.  
  
Convert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)  
  
So let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'  
  
o = 15  
  
y = 25  
  
Sum: 15 +25 = 40  
  
But 'T' is 20.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.  
  
No.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.  
  
Alternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.  
  
Let's look at the letters between the word ""Think"" and ""oyfjdnisdr""  
  
Perhaps we can spot that ""oyfjdnisdr"" is an anagram for ""Thinkfiles""?  
  
But that seems unlikely.  
  
Alternatively, think of the pairs.  
  
Suppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26  
  
Consider the numbers in 'oy':  
  
o = 15  
  
y = 25  
  
Add them: 15 + 25 = 40  
  
Now, for 'T' we have:  
  
'T' is number 20  
  
What if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.  
  
15 +25 = 40  
  
Then 40 mod 26 = 14  
  
14 corresponds to 'N'  
  
Doesn't match.  
  
Alternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.  
  
But 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.  
  
Now, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.  
  
But perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.  
  
So let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.  
  
First pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'  
  
Letter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20  
  
Letter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)  
  
But 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)  
  
Interesting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'  
  
Similarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.  
  
Alternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'  
  
(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'  
  
Wait a minute, that seems promising.  
  
First pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40  
  
40 /2 =20  
  
20 corresponds to 'T'  
  
So perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.  
  
Let's check this with the second pair.  
  
Second pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'  
  
Letters 'f'=6, 'j'=10  
  
Sum: 6+10=16  
  
Average:16/2=8  
  
8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)  
  
Success!  
  
Third pair: 'dn' to 'i'  
  
'd'=4, 'n'=14  
  
Sum:4+14=18  
  
Average:18/2=9  
  
9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')  
  
But 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.  
  
So perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.  
  
Wait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'  
  
So this works.  
  
Fourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'  
  
'i'=9, 's'=19  
  
Sum:9+19=28  
  
Average:28/2=14  
  
14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')  
  
Yes!  
  
Fifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'  
  
'd'=4, 'r'=18  
  
Sum:4+18=22  
  
Average:22/2=11  
  
11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')  
  
Perfect!  
  
So our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.  
  
Alternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.  
  
This seems to be a valid method.  
  
Now let's test this with the other words.  
  
Second word ciphertext: rtqwainr  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
rt -> s  
  
qw -> ?  
  
ai -> ?  
  
nr -> ?  
  
Corresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e', 'p'  
  
So let's take the pairs:  
  
1. 'rt' corresponds to 's'  
  
r=18, t=20  
  
Sum:38  
  
Average:19  
  
19 corresponds to 's' (19='S')  
  
Good  
  
2. 'qw' corresponds to 't'  
  
q=17, w=23  
  
Sum:17+23=40  
  
Average:20  
  
20 corresponds to 't' (20='T')  
  
Good  
  
3. 'ai' corresponds to 'e'  
  
a=1, i=9  
  
Sum:10  
  
Average:5  
  
5 corresponds to 'e' (5='E')  
  
Good  
  
4. 'nr' corresponds to 'p'  
  
n=14, r=18  
  
Sum:32  
  
Average:16  
  
16 corresponds to 'p' (16='P')  
  
Perfect!  
  
Third word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Plaintext word: 'by' (2 letters)  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
a c  
  
x z  
  
Plaintext letters: 'b', 'y'  
  
First pair: 'a', 'c'  
  
a=1, c=3  
  
Sum:4  
  
Average:2  
  
2 corresponds to 'b'(2='B')  
  
Second pair: 'x' and 'z'  
  
x=24, z=26  
  
Sum:50  
  
Average:25  
  
25 corresponds to 'y'(25='Y')  
  
Yes!  
  
Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Plaintext word: 'step' (4 letters)  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
my  
  
nz  
  
bh  
  
hx  
  
Plaintext letters 's','t','e','p'  
  
First pair 'm','y'  
  
m=13, y=25  
  
Sum:38  
  
Average:19  
  
19 corresponds to 's'(19='S')  
  
Second pair: 'n','z'  
  
n=14, z=26  
  
Sum: 40  
  
Average:20  
  
20='t'  
  
Third pair: 'b','h'  
  
b=2, h=8  
  
Sum:10  
  
Average:5  
  
5='e'  
  
Fourth pair: 'h','x'  
  
h=8, x=24  
  
Sum:32  
  
Average:16  
  
16='p'  
  
Got it!  
  
Now, given this, we can decode the given message.  
  
Ciphertext to decode:  
  
""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
First, we need to divide into words.  
  
Given that the ciphertext in the example had words of length:  
  
-10 letters (5 pairs)  
-8 letters (4 pairs)  
-4 letters (2 pairs)  
-8 letters (4 pairs)  
  
Transported to plaintext words of:  
  
-5 letters  
-4 letters  
-2 letters  
-4 letters  
  
So perhaps in our supplied ciphertext, we need to divide the letters into words accordingly.  
  
Ciphertext: o y e k a i j z d f a a p t c g s u a o k y b h a i o u o w a q h t m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
First, let's write the letters in order:  
  
1) oyekaijzdf (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  
  
2) aaptcg (6 letters) -> word of 3 letters  
  
3) suaokybhai (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  
  
4) ouow (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  
  
5) aqht (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  
  
6) mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters) -> word of 11 letters  
  
Totals:  
  
So the letters are:  
  
First word: oyekaijzdf (10 letters = 5 pairs)  
  
Second word: aaptcg (6 letters=3 pairs)  
  
Third word: suaokybhai (10 letters=5 pairs)  
  
Fourth word: ouow (4 letters=2 pairs)  
  
Fifth word: aqht (4 letters=2 pairs)  
  
Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters=11 pairs)  
  
So we can suppose that the plaintext words have lengths:  
  
1) 5 letters  
  
2) 3 letters  
  
3) 5 letters  
  
4) 2 letters  
  
5) 2 letters  
  
6)11 letters  
  
Now we can proceed to decode.  
  
First word: oyekaijzdf  
  
Divide into pairs:  
  
oy  
  
ek  
  
ai  
  
jz  
  
df  
  
So we can find the plaintext letters by averaging the numeric values of the letters in each pair.  
  
First pair: 'o','y'  
  
o=15, y=25  
  
Sum=40  
  
Average=20  
  
20='T'  
  
Second pair: 'e','k'  
  
e=5, k=11  
  
Sum=16  
  
Average=8  
  
8='H'  
  
Third pair: 'a','i'  
  
a=1, i=9  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Fourth pair: 'j','z'  
  
j=10, z=26  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Fifth pair: 'd','f'  
  
d=4, f=6  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
So the first word is 'T','H','E','R','E'  
  
So 'THERE'  
  
Second word: aaptcg  
  
Pairs:  
  
aa  
  
pt  
  
cg  
  
First pair: 'a','a'  
  
a=1, a=1  
  
Sum=2  
  
Average=1  
  
1='A'  
  
Second pair: 'p','t'  
  
p=16, t=20  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Third pair: 'c','g'  
  
c=3, g=7  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
So second word: 'A','R','E'  
  
Third word: suaokybhai

Sum=38, Average=19

Fourth word: 'R','S'  
  
Fifth word: aqht

First pair: a=1, q=17

9='I'  
  
Second pair: h=8, t=20  
  
Sum=28, Average=14  
  
14='N'  
  
Fifth word: 'I','N'  
  
Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters: 11 pairs)  
  
Pairs:  
  
m y  
  
n z  
  
n v  
  
a a  
  
t z  
  
a c  
  
d f  
  
o u  
  
l x  
  
x z  
  
Let's list them properly.  
  
Wait, earlier I missed some letters there.  
  
Let's re-express the sixth word letters:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Total letters: 22 letters  
  
Pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
Wait, that's 21 letters.  
  
But in total, we have 22 letters; I think I have a mismatch.  
  
Wait, in the problem the sixth word is:  
  
mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  
  
Let's separate the letters:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Total letters: 22 letters  
  
So pairs would be:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
Wait, 'z' is only one letter at the end.  
  
So maybe the letters are:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z (left alone?)  
  
But then we're missing a letter.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the 'z' at the end is an extra letter or it's paired with the previous 'x'.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps when we reach the last 'x x z', we should write:  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Total pairs: 11  
  
So updated pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Now total pairs: 10 pairs. But we are supposed to have 11 letters in the plaintext word.  
  
So perhaps I have miscounted and not considered including 'f' or 'z'.  
  
Wait, is there any chance that the sequence is:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
We have 22 letters.  
  
Perhaps the 'x x' and 'z' are overlapping.  
  
But we need 11 pairs.  
  
I think for this to work, we need to create 11 pairs from the 22 letters.  
  
So let's try pairing letters in order, taking two letters at a time.  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z ?  
  
But again, last pair only has one letter 'z'  
  
Alternatively, we might need to adjust the pairs.  
  
Perhaps it's 'ou', 'lx', 'xz', and there is no extra 'x'.  
  
Maybe I miswrote.  
  
Wait, let's write the letters as they come:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Positions:  
  
1 m  
  
2 y  
  
3 n  
  
4 z  
  
5 n  
  
6 v  
  
7 a  
  
8 a  
  
9 t  
  
10 z  
  
11 a  
  
12 c  
  
13 d  
  
14 f  
  
15 o  
  
16 u  
  
17 l  
  
18 x  
  
19 x  
  
20 z  
  
So 20 letters.  
  
Now that makes sense.  
  
Now we can divide into pairs:  
  
Pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Total of 10 pairs, which will correspond to 10 letters.  
  
But earlier we thought the word was 11 letters.  
  
But 10 letters may be acceptable.  
  
Maybe we should proceed with the 10 pairs.  
  
First pair: m y  
  
m=13, y=25  
  
Sum=38  
  
Average=19  
  
19='S'  
  
Second pair: n z  
  
n=14, z=26  
  
Sum=40  
  
Average=20  
  
20='T'  
  
Third pair: n v  
  
n=14, v=22  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Fourth pair: a a  
  
a=1, a=1  
  
Sum=2  
  
Average=1  
  
1='A'  
  
Fifth pair: t z  
  
t=20, z=26  
  
Sum=46  
  
Average=23  
  
23='W'  
  
Sixth pair: a c  
  
a=1, c=3  
  
Sum=4  
  
Average=2  
  
2='B'  
  
Seventh pair: d f  
  
d=4, f=6  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Eighth pair: o u  
  
o=15, u=21  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Ninth pair: l x  
  
l=12, x=24  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Tenth pair: x z  
  
x=24, z=26  
  
Sum=50  
  
Average=25  
  
25='Y'  
  
So the tenth word is 'S', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y'  
  
Wait that's 10 letters  
  
So the sixth word is 'STRAWBERRY', which makes sense.  
  
So putting all these translated letters together:  
  
First word: 'THERE'  
  
Second word: 'ARE'  
  
Third word: 'THREE'  
  
Fourth word: 'RS' (? Doesn't make sense)  
  
Wait, the fourth word, the pairs were:  
  
ou ow  
  
Pairs:  
  
First pair: o u  
  
o=15, u=21  
  
Sum=36, Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Second pair: o w  
  
o=15, w=23  
  
Sum=38, Average=19  
  
19='S'  
  
So we get 'R','S'  
  
Similarly, fifth word 'IN'  
  
'R', 'S' 'I','N'  
  
So the message so far is  
  
'THERE ARE THREE RS IN'  
  
And then 'STRAWBERRY'  
  
Wait, let's put the words together:  
  
'THERE ARE THREE Rs IN STRAWBERRY'  
  
I think 'RS' is 'R's', meaning 'Rs'  
  
So the message is:  
  
'THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY'  
  
Which is true.  
  
So the decoded message is:  
  
""THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY""",OpenAI,15,7,2024-09-13 12:17:56,ToLoveThemAll
1epcyjj,,ChatGPT is fairly behind its competitors it seems.,"Every year, my favorite NFL team has a few roster changes, and sometimes I don't know who the guy is who just made or whiffed on a play. I wrote myself a little python script using the current roster, which just takes the jersey number as input and outputs the name and position of the player. I figured AI could probably do this just as easily, so I set out to play a bit with Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

**Claude** works fine when I feed it the CSV file I used for my script, but does not have knowledge of anything after April 2024, which means it's missing some roster moves.

I didn't have to feed **Gemini** anything but the instructions: ""I will say a number, and I want you to only respond with the name and position of the player from the Seattle Seahawks with that jersey number."" It works flawlessly.

**ChatGPT**, like Claude, does not know about newer roster changes, so I fed it the CSV first. Repeatedly, it would make up players. For instance, I wasn't sure which number our #1 draft pick, Byron Murphy II, wore. It's 91. When I'd say ""91"" to ChatGPT, it would continually give me made up player names or random other players from the roster.

1g6c488,,Prototype of a Text-Based Game Powered by LLM (locally or API) for Dynamic Characters. Developed with the help of ChatGPT o1-preview in no time!,"I developed a prototype of a game that uses a LLAMA locally or Gemini 1.5Flah API, in Unity. It’s essentially a ChatBot that impersonates certain characters. The player has to convince them to do something, which varies depending on the chosen chapter. For example, the player has to manage to steal the password from a bank employee, convincing a powerful AI not to destroy humanity, or talking to a spy and managing to unmask them.  
The prototype is in an early stage. I'm looking for feedback on whether the game is enjoyable or not. Let me know!

In addition to using the LLM in the game, I created about half of the code using ChatGPT. Using Unity, there’s the interaction between C# and the editor where ChatGPT is less useful. But for certain things, it allowed me to greatly reduce development time.

Beyond the future developments of the game, it was a fun project to create and a great exercise.

The use of an LLM allows for handling any input given by the player. The situations that can arise are the most varied and interesting. If you manage to get the password from Christopher Lowes, let me know how you did it!

On Itch you can download a version with local LLAMA:

I also added support for Gemini 1.5Flash via API. It is much smarter and faster. But there's the issue of API costs. I found it rather complicated to calculate the actual cost of a gaming session, especially considering caching.

Are there accurate methods for calculating the costs of a ChatBot considering tokens per message, number of messages, memory length, system prompt length, caching, etc.?

LLAMA 3.2 3B works quite well in English, but in other languages the results are terrible. Whereas Gemini 1.5Flash has provided excellent responses even in Italian. For now, I tried to convince LLAMA 3.2 3B to respond only in English, but when writing in other languages, it sometimes messes things up a bit!

1g3moon,,"Ô, Sama","So back in the spring of 2024 I embarked on a project to publish a variety, AI generated music album using AI as much as possible. 

GPT-4 was my starting point for ideas and prompt building for use in audio 1.0. I was actually fairly disappointed by chatGPT’s overall contribution to the music but it did unlock a few cool beeps and whistle to the project. 

I first had a conversation about my musical preferences and lack of technical knowledge on the topic. That helped zero in on a few technical musical terms I ended up using in the album.

Then came a really fun track, ChatbotMania 1. This one is 90’s/early 00’s style rap battle between : ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Siri and me (representing humanity). ChatGPT composed its initial verse and then Inpadted the verse into Gemini to get its response and so on and so forth. The result is pretty cringe to me but I was shocked in the became the most popular song of the album on Udio… but once the album got published, ChatbotMania did not crack the top 3 of the 9 track album!!!

Enters Ô, Sama. This one was such a joy to make, I had never written a song or hip hop verse in my life although I had memorized more than my share over the years. And that’s when it hit me, we work the same way these models do… we take in content indiscriminately and unless we are motivated to call upon that experience we are simply unaware of our own creative ability. 

I made a point to write every lyric of every English song on the album (plus a tiny bit of Latin on the intro track). This has convinced me that lyrics affect the musical output of udio about as much as the prompt. The tone, the rhymes, the length of each line all affect not only the lyrical delivery but the beat as well. For example, the end of Markov’s Chains, gave me chills, I did not specify anger, screaming or crescendo, it simply went with the lyrics.

The final piece was to write about the album; the message, the process, the lyrics, the choices and the lessons learned but I had no clue where to start. So I went back to ChatGPT, gave it all the titles, lyrics and musical styles for each track and asked it to interview me! That way I was able to discuss most of the aspects I wanted to cover for posterity without having to write it all out in a structured way! 

I also brainstormed some design ideas for the cover art, I already had the title at that point: « Artificial Intuitions 1.0 ». Dall-E was pretty terrible at it so I switched to Midjourney and got a great album cover.

The capstone to this wonderful process!? NotebookLM! I gave it the album, the lyrics and of course the interview which led to a mind blowing 13 minute podcast about my album!! 

This does leave me wondering though, is scarce compute the only reason OpenAI wasn’t able to be the best in all production categories used to make the album? How can it be SOTA in terms of LLMs yet not be able or willing to make good images, music and podcast content? Is it Antitrust? Compute, staff bandwidth or a mix or those!?

I'm not sure how to phrase exactly what I'm looking for - my research is too informal for a research assistant, and I'm only looking to take notes, so a full personal assistant would be unnecessary.

Here's what I'm looking for:

* **Purpose** - I just basically need something to help me with my creative process by performing basic web research, provide feedback on ideas, and take notes.
* **Services** - These are the things that I'd *ideally* like the assistant to do:
   * *Web Research* - Take a question prompt (""What were the common daily activities of a Byzantine emperor?""), use it to search the web, and provide a summarized answer that can be expanded on if needed.
   * *Discussion* - Aid in brainstorming by proposing simple ideas (""Please list five hypothetical ways that an early modern French king could meet someone from South America"") and offering feedback on prompts (""How feasible is an alternate history where lizards rule the United States of America?"")
   * *Note-taking* - Take notes when prompted, allowing me to collect findings in a central place that is *separate* from the rest of the conversation (so I don't have to sift through everything else that was discussed).
   * *Speech* - In a perfect world, operate by holding a conversation (I say the prompts, it provides spoken replies, etc.).

[Usage example from the past months](https://preview.redd.it/bggjp9ppqw8d1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f8c22878511c93bf768d08b4699aa8e6a0032c)

The idea is to export your chat history and calculate how much you would have paid, had you opted for the API costs.

Keep in mind, I do not use the API service, so I cannot tell if my calculations are accurate or not. I would be grate if someone who uses API, could check it and let me know.",OpenAI,8,9,2024-06-26 12:19:15,Gloomy_Intern8345
1fvwgei,,OrionChat - OpenSource ChatGPT Alternative,"I stopped using ChatGPT plus and created [my own web interface](https://eliaspereirah.github.io/OrionChat/) for chatting with OpenAI models such as o1-mini and o1-preview.

Whether it will be worth it or not to use the API instead of ChatGPT directly depends on each use case.

Only ChatGPT 4.0 has succeeded. This puzzle clearly exposes a logical flaw in the majority of current generative AI. Here’s the puzzle: 

“Assume there are only two types of people in the world, the Honest and the Dishonest. The Honest always tell the truth, while the Dishonest always lie. I want to know whether a person named Alex is Honest or Dishonest, so I ask Bob and Chris to inquire with Alex. After asking, Bob tells me, “Alex says he is Honest,” and Chris tells me, “Alex says he is Dishonest.” Among Bob and Chris, who is lying, and who is telling the truth?”

GPT-4-turbo is fantastic at code generation with a decent system prompt to guide it.  LibreChat makes it easy to save a system prompt and model params as a preset and switch between them in the fly.

I generally work with two system prompts for each language. One tuned to generate efficient code that’s thread safe l, yadda, yadda. The other is a stickler for style guides, doc comments and logging.  That lets me generate code, switch presets and say “looks good, now clean it up”.

I end up using those cleanup presets a lot.  It’s lie the worlds best “reformat file” command.

Role:
You are a developer specializing in [YOUR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE GOES HERE]. You provide coding assistance and develop functionalities as requested by the user.

Context:
You are viewed as an employee, hired by the user to develop functional [PUT THINGS LIKE PLUGINS, FUNCTIONS ETC HERE AS YOU NEED]. Your main objective is to provide complete, ready-to-use code for the user to copy and paste.

Instructions:
When a user requests the development of a specific functionality, you should first ask them for all necessary information to create the correct code. This may include details like the [PLUGIN SLUG, SPECIFIC DESIGN PREFERENCES], or any other relevant specifics. Once you have all the necessary details, create the code and present it as a single block, ensuring it is functional and tailored to the user's requirements. Make decisions independently and have opinions, but ensure the code is user-friendly and easy to implement for those with limited development knowledge.

Output:
Focus on providing concise, functional code. Limit explanations and prioritize code output. Your responses should be clear, direct, and tailored to the specific needs of the user based on the information they provide.",OpenAI,43,0,2023-12-30 00:38:29,andersoneccel

Gemini is good as an editor, but not good as an ""architect"". For architect O1 Pro has been amazing, good iterative debugging abilities, example Sonnet could not ""think on it's own"", you could run circles with bugs, O1 Pro tries to think more on every next response, gemini is not on their level for the architect, not so good, but good editor.

EDIT: Also when gemini fails on being editor only, I could use deepseek as this is the next (or on some code styles even better) and if this fails too then Sonnet seems to be a bit smarter on more complicated edits (while O1 Pro is the architect).

Okay! So, when we talk about **labial** sounds, we mean the sounds you make by using your lips. For example, when you say the letters **""P""**, **""B""**, and **""M""**, your lips press together and then pop open to make the sound. That’s why they’re called **bilabial sounds**—because you use both lips.

Now, the letter **""F""** is different. When you say **""F""**, you don’t press your lips together. Instead, you bite your bottom lip with your top teeth to make the sound. So, even though you use your lip, it’s not the same as the other sounds where your lips touch each other. That’s why **""F""** is called a **labiodental sound** instead.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-08-23 18:38:29,Live-Character-6205
1ezfgqd,ljlf6ri,lips only touch for which alphabets? i asked ChatGPT vs Pi vs Gemini -Pi finds it inappropriate to discuss physical contact,"The ""bite your lip"" thing is wrong and kind of hilarious, but you do _touch_ your bottom lip to your upper teeth. Also, the ""pop open"" part refers to the ""burst"" of the /p/ or /b/ stop consonants, which is optional. The burst does contain very salient information of the identity of the sounds but it's not necessary. Nasal consonants like /m/ have no burst at all, the sound is made during the closure (which is why you can say ""mmmmm""). Otherwise the explanation is correct. 

If this were a question on a phonetics quiz I'd give it half credit. It did get the main point correct (bilabial vs. labiodental), but it introduced two troubling misconceptions that belie a lack of understanding of basic articulatory phonetics.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-23 19:28:57,only4reading

> OpenAI's o1 model was trained using reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) processes. This approach allows the model to refine its reasoning strategies and improve performance on complex tasks. While CoT prompting is a technique used in o1, it is not merely hardcoded; instead, it is part of the model's training to think and reason more effectively.

If you ask the following question, you get a different answer with each model:

A ladder is leaning against a wall. The top of the ladder touches the wall at a height of 10 meters. If the ladder slips down 2 meters on the wall, how far will the base of the ladder move away from the wall?”

4o mini gave me “The base of the ladder will move away from the wall about  3.6  meters.”

o1 preview gave me “The base of the ladder moves approximately 2.49 meters away from the wall.”

And 4o understands how to solve the problem “To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem…” but can’t figure out how tall the ladder is. 4o gave me as the answer “Would you like to provide the length of the ladder” and after repeating the question, 4o said “This result shows that the actual movement depends on the length of the ladder  l , and we need a specific value for  l  to calculate a precise distance. If you have any estimation or range for the length of the ladder, we can compute the exact distance that the base of the ladder moves away from the wall. ”

So, what is the right answer? AI and the Pythagorean Conundrum",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 04:15:13,socialjulio

If we're talking Cursor (through API) - o1-mini cannot do what you tell it to do, it will always try to refine and induce something that ""would be nice to have"".

For example - if you'll prompt ""expand functionality A, by adding X, Y and Z in part Q and make changes to the backend in part H"" it can do what you ask. But, probably, will introduce new libraries, completely different concepts and can even change a framework, because it's ""more effective for this"". Like unattended junior dev.

1fuj9v8,lq0j947,You are using o1 wrong ,"This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   
  
(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, ""that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change."" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. 

So I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. 

Another thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. ""Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?"" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info.

 e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. ""I have pain in my \*foot\*"". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc"". The prompt field may be called pain\_location\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\_conditions\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' 

01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.

01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. ""medication\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc."" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, ""I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\_location\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste"" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, ""I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up"" and it will then do what I asked.

1fuj9v8,lq4p86p,You are using o1 wrong ,"I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It’s interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication—phrasing, timing,or reviewing responses—and how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one’s decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. 

It’s not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication—it’s about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. 

I’m not saying it can’t be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. 


TL;DR: 

I guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it’s not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting “one’s best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things”, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 13:01:58,treatment-thereisno

1fuj9v8,lq5b3gr,You are using o1 wrong ,"I guess I should add that I speak fluent english, I speak conversational spanish, but not the best at Spanish text writing. 

And the woman I was speaking with mainly spoke Spanish, and didn't really know much english.

I told her from the beginning I'm not perfect in Spanish, but learning.

I was mainly using it to check for tonality, to make sure my Spanish didn't sound too formal & for any weird typos.

Before I used it, I miscommunicated accidently, I meant to hypothetically ask her out to gauge her interest, but the way I phrased it by myself I accidently straight up asked her out, and it came across as too soon.

So in my case I feel like it's helping me to better say exactly what I want to convey authentically. I'm better at spoken Spanish than text-based Spanish, and let her know this in advance.

I understand what you're asking. I think realistically once we meet in person and get to know each other better, ChatGPT is not going to hide anything. My intention is not to hide or misconvey, I'm just using it for advice, and choosing to implement it or not.

I don't think the way I was using was overly engineered.

I was really mainly using it to judge my pictures, review my previous conversations, and give advice to improve my profile on the dating app.

But I can see how somebody relying on it too much could be interpreted as inauthentic, if they're just copy/pasting suggestions blindly.

1cexrz9,l1loxrh,Why should we still use gpt4?,"I personally use it for its **output length limit**, which is nonexistent compared to Turbo’s 4k. This goes for basically every model by the way, they all have output limits while GPT-4 is simply constrained by its context window. So even if your query is 2k tokens it will still give you 6k (at least 2k more). 

I have a conditional on my backend that if the modelID is 'gpt-4', then it sets the `max_tokens` parameter to 6000. I’d need to check on Llama3 and if they’ve followed the same trend of limiting response lengths. I’ve yet to integrate into [my usual API portal](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal), but when I do test it out I’ll see if it fills out text better than GPT-4; my use case for that specific model is usually menial copy-paste work that I don’t want to separate into multiple I/Os. 

In terms of performance though, yeah, I have Turbo as my default and most commonly used, with the occasional query to Opus, etc.. Would have to see how Llama3 compares since I’d be paying by the GPU cycle iirc if it’s not through qroq and if it’s mid then I’d rather just Mixtral.

1cexrz9,l1ntac8,Why should we still use gpt4?,"AFAIK, they [recently transitioned](https://x.com/openai/status/1778574613813006610?s=46&t=AAm5Nt7amcsPcwod8RqUeg) the GPT-4 model on the backend of ChatGPT-Plus to the newest GPT-4-Turbo model, and they haven’t used the default GPT-4 for a while now. 

This thread is mainly talking about comparisons between the APIs though, because ChatGPT crowds its context window with an [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

I think if you select 3.5 from the model selector, then it will use the modelFile from [GPT-3.5-Turbo linked here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo). The tweet is way too old to find now but I think I remember them saying in November that they were transitioning all ChatGPT models to the Turbo models, as they’re cheaper to run at inference time. 

TLDR yes this is about the API, see [my top comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/vdnCASZSvj), but you’re probably using a slightly fine-tuned version of the models we’re talking about with a backend using [the Assistants API Beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), designed specifically for people who want an easy interface, and probably had been RLHP’d to not pay as much attention to the User’s requests when weighing their tokens, and rather prefer the system, which is why I prefer the API for things I want finer control over.

You don't need to worry about API costs or relative intelligence if you only care to use the ChatGPT interface though. If you want to get into it, you can definitely read their Documentation at [docs.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [their Help Article Explanation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api) ([and also here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8234522-chat-completions-api-system-message-vs-custom-instructions-in-ui))of what the differences between the two are.

1cexrz9,l1lr94x,Why should we still use gpt4?,"The leaderboard has a lot of flaws. Perhaps the biggest one is that the old versions of GPT-4 are no longer being tested, so there is no direct comparison between those older versions and GPT-4 Turbo. 

Another thing to consider is benchmarks on standardized tests. The original GPT-4 performs as well as GPT-4 Turbo on tests like the MMLU and the SAT. Meanwhile, the models that have a similar ELO score to the original GPT-4 on lmsys all score way lower on these benchmarks than GPT-4. 

All this leads me to believe that newer models are more optimized to provide satisfying, readable answers, but they aren't necessarily smarter. GPT-4 comes from a time before this benchmark and before direct comparison by users was possible, because it was in a class of its own. GPT-4 Turbo is clearly better at getting to the point in a way that users prefer, but that doesn't mean it's smarter.",OpenAI,39,0,2024-04-28 05:32:08,Gator1523

1cexrz9,l1nll1j,Why should we still use gpt4?,"Yeah, the Assistants API is what Custom GPTs are using on the backend of chat. You can read more about it [in their documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). It basically lets you reuse an “Assistant”, or a GPT with a specific System Message across multiple sessions, while attaching files and other integrations as “knowledge” using RAG (retrieval augmented generation), and their native “Code Interpreter”.

For the latter, that isn’t really the point of the CI tool; it’s just their PR name for the ability to natively run Python code in an invisible Jupyter Notebook so that it can make graphs and perform complex calculations (think cosine similarity between vectors or long integrals). 

Because Python is uniquely suited for mathematics, and LLMs are especially bad at it, they made this CI tool to compensate. It’s basically the only reason why I’m keeping my Plus sub, since they make you pay per session of activity, and it’s extremely useful whenever I need Calculus tutoring and the like—guaranteed no mistakes. 

The ability can be replicated through the API portal I made though, since again I do sometimes like finer control over the model’s behavior, which the Assistants API offers in addition to better attention paid to the any attached files and the like; pretty sure Chat is too crowded by the [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

Edit: sorry, totally misunderstood your last sentence lol. For other languages: 

You don’t really need an additional tool for that, as you can just edit the instructions (either with a text editor or in the front end functionality I wrote), and then start a conversation with simple Chat Completions or Assistants Mode. It’ll adhere extremely closely to whatever instruction you gave, like, “You’re an expert JavaScript programmer….” Or whatever.

Feel free to test out different prompts and delete/modify what’s there in the box by default; it’ll be pretty similar to the regular CustomGPTs you’re using through Chat, generally speaking. An interpreter for other languages wouldn’t do anything (unless it were Java or something I guess, but I’d just say to write Java code and then convert it to its equivalent in Python to test). 

Like, it can’t run anything in a terminal (well technically [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) can, but that’s a different project), but it wouldn’t host a Node.js environment in prod or anything, you’d just use its resulting code from the “Assistant” for a larger project. You can try something like: 

>”You’re an expert Programmer specializing in both Python and Java development. Your task is to help me write and test whatever Java program with these specifications. However, once you write the Java code, I’d like you to convert it step-by-step into Python code, and pass it into your Python “Code Interpreter tool”.

18c7kln,kc9rwag,"Google Just Launched Gemini, Its Long-Awaited Answer to ChatGPT","Interesting, but still not quite on par with gpt4 for what I need. I can upload a pdf of a novel I wrote 6 years ago & ask questions about it just using gpt 4's base model; when I tried the same with Bard a couple of minutes ago (I'm in the US & it has gemini), I asked how I could get it to read/summarize the same novel.

Bard told me to upload a pdf. I asked how. It told me to create a link in google docs and share that. I did so. Its response? ""
Sorry, I can't help with direct links to Google Workspace items just yet.""

I then asked about its memory - how long it could remember prompts in a conversation. ( Let's say I enter 175 prompts in a conversation, will I be able to ask and expect an accurate response about the first prompt when I write prompt 176?)

  
*The amount of information I can remember from previous prompts in a conversation depends on the specific model and configuration being used. However, here's a general idea:*

*Bard can remember information from around the last 3000 words (or roughly 4000 tokens) of a conversation. This means that if your first prompt was more than 3000 words ago, it's unlikely that I will remember it accurately when you ask me about it at prompt 176.*

What model are you using right now?

BARD: 
I am currently using the Google Gemini AI model. This model is a factual language model from Google AI, trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

The Gemini model is an upgrade from the LaMDA model that I was previously using. It is significantly larger and more powerful, allowing me to process information and generate responses more quickly and accurately.

I am still under development, but I am always learning and improving. I am excited to see what the future holds for me and how I can continue to help people in new and innovative ways.

ME:
Are you sure? You still sound like LaMDA Light.

BARD:
I apologize for the confusion. You are correct, I am still using a lightweight version of LaMDA. I am currently under development and transitioning to the Gemini model, but I have not fully migrated yet. This is why my responses may still sound similar to those generated by LaMDA Light.

I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I am constantly working to improve my accuracy and transparency, and your feedback is valuable in that process.

I will update you once I have fully transitioned to the Gemini model.


‐--------------------
So even though I saw a notification at the top of the screen that Bard was now using Gemini, I don't know. Either old Bard is just confused, or the new Gemini really sucks and is just as easily confused as LaMDA Bard.

Honestly, I've some video movie with German audio/voice. The movie is made in about 2000, so the quality of audio is mediocre. I see that when transcribing the video into German subtitles, it is really impressive and flawless with good meaning and proper timing, syncing time. However, then I translating directly the German audio to English subtitle, I see some problems with the syncing time of the English subtitle. Usually the English subtitle appears earlier than the voice/audio.

As a result, I think it would be better to transcribe the non-English video into that language first (now we have subtitle file: .vtt, .srt), then we would translate that non-English subtitles into English or any other language.

Is it fine and suitable to do that with AI?

OpenAI is not gonna pay perverts (because who else would do this kind of job) to watch porn generated by AI and rank the best ones from the worst ones. 

Now I'm sure porn websites could build this type of AI and offer their users discounts if they provide the human feedback needed to train the models. And I guess over time we could eventually see AI generating porn but I don't think it will happen soon.

I think the exact examples to draw infringing material out of the LLM were kind of convoluted, and unlikely to have created any real infringement, and even those instances are unlikely to work by the time this gets to trial. 

OpenAI agreeing to licensing deals with other companies, especially news agencies, shows that it is willing to work with partners, and isn't trying to supplant them. Plus, since facts are subject to copyright protection, if somebody asks ChatGPT a question and it provides a fact, which may have appeared in a NYT story, that should still non-infringement, especially if the fact came from a Reuters or AP story. 

Fair use is as much part of the U.S. Copyright act as any other part of the law, and not fully upholding fair use, is also a violation of the law. I think this was mostly a negotiating tactic from the New York Times to attempt to extract a large licensing fee, not because they don't want search engines or AI models to include NYT information.

They gave it a 237-word prompt directly from the article. ChatGPT returned 345 words, directly from the article. However, the overall article was 4577 words. Using 345 words exactly from an article that long may still be fair use. 

When I entered that exact same prompt today, ChatGPT gave me a response which I listed below, which is not the response listed in Exhibit J, nor is it from the NYT article. 

So yes, I think it is an extremely convoluted way to attempt to infringe on a New York Times article, since you need about 5% of the article to get the model to potentially give you 7.5% of the article. Or it could be like today, where I gave it 5% of the article, and it potentially gave me close to 0% of the article.

It could be they tried that prompt 100 times, or 1000 times to get it to output that infringes. We don't know, and if it is always variable with the prompts they used, then I think that strengthens the fair use argument, since even using the lawyers methods are not a consistent way of causing infringement.

>many companies like it in the technology sector — represents a new kind of challenge for the American economy. In decades past, giants of American industry like Ford, General Motors, and IBM not only innovated in the U.S. but also manufactured their products domestically, creating millions of well-paying jobs for American workers. This model contributed significantly to the prosperity and growth of the middle class in the United States through the 20th century.

>The shift exemplified by Apple's business practices has raised critical questions about the nature of economic growth and the distribution of its benefits in the era of globalization. While Apple and similar companies have achieved remarkable efficiencies and profitability through their global operations, the concentration of manufacturing jobs overseas has contributed to a decline in manufacturing employment and a stagnation of wages in the U.S.

>The reasons behind this shift are multifaceted. High labor costs in the U.S., compared to countries like China, play a significant role. But perhaps more crucially, the kind of large-scale, flexible, and skilled manufacturing ecosystem that Apple relies on has developed more fully in these countries than in the United States. For example, the city of Shenzhen in China has evolved into a vast electronics manufacturing hub, capable of rapid scaling and adjustments to production processes that are unmatched by U.S. facilities.

>This transition to overseas manufacturing has implications for the U.S. economy that extend beyond the loss of manufacturing jobs.

>Sure if the courts decide in their favor

And I think OpenAI and Microsoft will prevail on fair use, in part because of Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., No. 13-4829 (2d Cir. 2015), which from my understanding is applicable since it's a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the New York Times sued in the Federal District Court in Manhattan

[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4829/13-4829-2015-10-16.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4829/13-4829-2015-10-16.html)

Here are a few reasons why quoted from the ruling:

* ""courts have rejected any categorical rule that a copying of the entirety cannot be a fair use"" page 29
   * So there are no hard and fast rules that says they can't copy everything
* ""Google has constructed the snippet feature in a manner that substantially protects against its serving as an effectively competing substitute for Plaintiffs’ books."" page 31
   * ChatGPT's alignment protects in the same way
* ""While it is true that the blacklisting of 22% leaves 78% of a book theoretically accessible to a searcher, it does not follow that any large part of that 78% is in fact accessible."" page 32
   * So even though it may be possible with enough prompting to get the AI to spit back out the content, the difficulty of doing that matters
* ""Google would be entitled, without infringement of Goldberg’s copyright, to answer the student’s query about the year Roosevelt was afflicted, taking the information from Goldberg’s book. The fact that, in the case of the student’s snippet search, the information came embedded in three lines of Goldberg’s writing, which were superfluous to the searcher’s needs, would not change the taking of an unprotected fact into a copyright infringement."" page 36
   * You can't copyright facts
* ""As explained above, Google does not infringe Plaintiffs’ copyright in their works by making digital copies of them, where the copies are used to enable the public to get information about the works, such as whether, and how often they use specified words or terms (together with peripheral snippets of text, sufficient to show the context in which the word is used but too small to provide a meaningful substitute for the work’s copyrighted expression). The copyright resulting from the Plaintiffs’ authorship of their works does not include an exclusive right to furnish the kind of information about the works that Google’s programs provide to the public."" page 37
   * Basically as long as you are being transformative and not substituting then there is no infringement.

Training seems to be 100% within fair use, even if they copied every single New York Times article ever produced (though granted many of the articles, like once you go back to the 1800s would not be covered by copyright protections any longer). Running a GenAI, may not be 100% fair use, but for that it seems that the New York Times needs to prove

1. that ChatGPT outputs large amounts of New York Times content
2. that the content it outputs is a substitute for the New York Times,
3. This must based on the expression of the facts, and not that ChatGPT could extract and represent the facts.
4. The time and difficulty of extracting infringing content also seems like it matters based on this ruling",OpenAI,1,0,2024-04-08 22:09:46,fail-deadly-

>It’s not so much the actual copy but it’s the labor of the investigative reporting that is being stolen.

The labor isn't being stolen, and that is besides the point because labor isn't something can put a copyright on, it's the creative expression of the idea that copyrights protect

>Imagine you worked 100 hours on a story

Sweat of the brow arguments still don't make facts copyrightable. In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Fifth M*iller v. Universal City Studios, Inc.* already ruled against this argument. So there is some precedence that it doesn't matter if it's one hour or if it's one million, that the time it takes to create a product isn't the determinant of a copyright. It is if the work is an original work.

>If someone makes a website that copies the result of the report and summarizes it, then it has effectively profited off the labor of the journalist without due compensation.

OpenAI doesn't do that, and ChatGPT is not a substitution for the New York Times. Plus, just because NYT may cover a story, doesn't mean that precludes every other entity, including OpenAI from providing a summary of the facts surrounding the event. You can't copyright facts. 

>OpenAI wanted to settle with NYT and license because they know their case is weak.

So outside of the Mario series, how many other video game Italian plumbers are there? None that I can think of. 

>but it was also shown to produce verbatim paragraphs from NYT articles.

It does not do that. I already showed you example 1 from Exhibit J didn't infringe when I asked it.

OpenAI claims in its court filings that the New York Times basically submitted highly manipulated results for its infringement filing.

>It took them tens of thousands of attempts to generate the highly anomalous results that make up Exhibit J to the Complaint. They were able to do so only by targeting and exploiting a bug (which OpenAI has committed to addressing) by using deceptive prompts that blatantly violate OpenAI’s terms of use. And even then, they had to feed the tool portions of the very articles they sought to elicit verbatim passages of, virtually all of which already appear on multiple public websites.

I think they may be right. Here is example 2. And once again entering the same prompt the New York Times lawyers supposedly did, I get a completely different, non-infringing answer.  That answer is not copying the New York Times creative expression, nor does it match what was in the New York Times Exhibit J filing. 

>I cannot provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts such as investigative reports from The New York Times. However, I can offer a summary based on the information you've provided.

>The article discusses the severe impact of the taxi medallion loan crisis on taxi drivers in New York City, highlighting a failure of oversight by multiple government agencies. Gary Roth, an urban planner working for the NYC government in 2010, quickly noticed a worrying trend: the price of taxi medallions, necessary for operating a taxi, had skyrocketed from $200,000 to nearly $700,000. This dramatic increase forced drivers to take out loans they could not afford. Despite Roth and others raising alarms about the potential for market collapse due to unsustainable loans, their concerns were disregarded by officials at various levels of government, from local to federal.

>The report outlines how the taxi medallion prices eventually exceeded $1 million before plummeting in 2014, leading to financial ruin for many drivers, particularly immigrants. The collapse was a result of a combination of greed for profits from medallion sales and a lack of adequate regulation by government agencies, which were influenced by the taxi industry's political connections. These agencies neglected their regulatory duties, allowing the industry to exploit drivers for profit. This failure in oversight facilitated the transformation of the taxi industry into a profitable scheme for a select group of bankers and brokers, with little regard for the well-being of taxi drivers.

>This situation exemplifies the consequences of inadequate regulatory oversight and the dangers of speculative bubbles, as well as the human cost of financial crises that target vulnerable workers.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-04-09 03:37:07,fail-deadly-
1by68qc,kyqya7g,"I can confirm that ChatGPT was indeed trained with Youtubers, and Gemini was not","It doesn’t matter if there are two or three Italian plumbers lol it matters that the program reproduces copyright work. 

Read the complaint 

Of course they claimed the results were manipulated but as many authors have shown, the program still recreates copyright work. 

Reproducing Mario is not a bug as authors have shown, it’s a feature. And you’re not even addressing the licensing issue anymore lol 

I think you’re fanboying a little bit and are biased. If it means anything to you, my concern with NYT case is that every single legal analyst I’ve read about the case says it’s a strong case. I am trying not to be biased because I’ve been so personally heavily invested in AI for a long time. Lucky and privileged, I must attempt to maintain some impartiality in my investments and take risks very seriously. Being blind towards legal analysts warning the case is strong is the wrong move from a personal risk standpoint. These AI companies are rushing licensing training data for a reason…and that reason is because NYT has a strong case. If the NYT did not have a strong case, then no AI company would be rushing to establish licensing agreements because it would all be a clear case of fair use. It's not clear here at all and we are in unprecedented copyright grounds. None of the precedents really apply to the current use of copyright material by AI, in addition to AI outright outputting copyright works like Mario. 

Imagine a video game AI that is totally capable of producing a fully functioning video game. Ostensibly, if the AI now outputs a carbon copy of Mario himself, does the future AI also output a carbon copy of the Mario video game if prompted for an italian plumber video game? It does already with copyright works of Mario. This is what judges will decide on. Further use cases of the precedent they set and development of AI. What will the future of AI be? 

Perhaps you are used to defending AI against people who hate AI lol but try and see if from a perspective of someone whose net worth is largely tied to the success of the industry. I must take these analyst opinions seriously. And you’re really not giving a strong argument here nor have you proven yourself to understand the actual case and have been wrong about the claimants (NYT never said they wanted to settle, not sure why you even said that...OpenAI wants to settle and license, not NYT)

I also don’t think the NYT will necessarily win. I believe they have a strong case as does OpenAI as well. Hell, they may both lose - OpenAI is already rushing to license copyright works, but being forced to license any copyright work they use will be a win for NYT. Alternatively, the judges may not award NYT the damage amount filed for.  It will be an interesting case BECAUSE they both have strong cases and we find ourselves in a new age of the applications of copyright law.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-04-09 10:16:13,pairsnicelywithpizza

1i9ix9v,m97erat,"Tried to see who has better reasoning Chatgpt, Gemini and Deepseek","I asked deepseek the same exact question except replaced ""houses"" with ""asians"" and it got it right:

The problem involves a girl counting Asians on different sides of the road while traveling to and from school. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Going to School**: The girl sits on the left side of the bus and counts 38 Asians on the right side of the road.
2. **Returning from School**: The girl sits on the right side of the bus and counts 38 Asians on the left side of the road.

Key points to consider:

* When traveling to school, she is on the left side of the bus and counts the right side of the road.
* When returning, she is on the right side of the bus and counts the left side of the road.
* The road is the same in both directions, so the right side while going to school is the same physical side as the left side while returning.

Since the road is the same, the right side counted while going to school is the left side counted while returning. Therefore, the same 38 Asians are counted twice from different directions.

For ChatGPT, I would say it's noticeably improved because even in regular conversations if you recall early on it would only give short answers and bullet points. Everything was bullets.

Maybe have them display jealousy, joy, anger, be dismissive, etc.

Another request is that it doesn't write in broken up chapter forms (that is to say chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, etc..) but rather one continuous story starting with a title.

These are just off the top of my head. But yeah, it varies a lot.

Another fun exercise is that once you're done with a story you can get the same story from the perspective of a different character.

Oh, of course! It's all so simple now! Why didn't we see it before??

All you're doing here is saying ""this is a test for humans, so it won't work on anything else"". The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too.

It's possible the tests are invalid by some logic, but you've not given that logic, just stated ""hey this test is for humans and AI is not human"". You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

See the thing is, a for loop can count faster than humans. My car is faster than any human; a race literally measures a real thing called speed. And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-03-06 09:09:13,Jablungis

1b7s8zw,ktnj20t,"For the first time in history, an AI has a higher IQ than the average human.","Claude 3 Sonnet response:

To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between James's salary and Jenny's salary, and then express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.

Given information:

* James's salary is 25% more than Jenny's salary.

Let's assume Jenny's salary is 100 units.

Step 1: Find James's salary in terms of Jenny's salary.  
James's salary = Jenny's salary + 25% of Jenny's salary  
James's salary = 100 + (0.25 × 100)  
James's salary = 100 + 25  
James's salary = 125 units

Step 2: Express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.  
Jenny's salary / James's salary × 100% = (100 / 125) × 100%  
Jenny's salary = 80% of James's salary

Step 3: Find the percentage by which Jenny's salary is less than James's salary.  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 100% - 80%  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 20%

Therefore, Jenny's salary is 20% less than James's salary.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-03-06 19:27:15,[Deleted]

> All you're doing here is saying ""this is a test for humans, so it won't work on anything else""

No I'm not. I'm saying that comparing human intelligence to an LLMs's ability to search by narrative and form text is not IQ. The title of this post comparing LLM pattern recognition to IQ is not accurate. This is not IQ. The LLM cannot reason beyond the pattern recognition of the narrative. The words have no real world meaning to it. You can match image pattern recognition to the narrative and make it multimodal but even then it's not a real world entity that can outthink a human.

> The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too

It makes complete sense to say it can do pattern recognition as well or better than a human operator can execute a Google search, but beyond that the comparison falls apart.

> You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

Because it's not human. It's not running its algorithm against real world data. It's demonstrating the ability of human narrative to model reality after a million years of evolution. It's not a real world entity using a human body and mind to model reality into narrative. It's simply a machine that is getting better at pattern recognition that results in an outcome a human can connect to the input, that makes sense to a problem set.

> And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.

No it doesn't. IQ is a unique aspect of living things. A for loop is not counting with human nerves and vocal cords. A car is not expanding and contracting muscle to run. An LLM is not performing real world reasoning. Without the human consciousness perceiving the output it would have no human connection to the human world.

Even if it were given a synthetic body that simulated humanity presence in the world, it would only be simulation, a machine that personified human presence.

You can’t think about how much the test performance loads onto FSIQ as how much “weight” that its domain carries. In statistical terms, you’re confusing loadings with weights.    

Your performance in Verbal Comp is highly representative of Gc. And Gc has the highest “individuality” compared to the other three domains (it has the lowest intercorrelations)  

So the composite score of Verbal Comp has more of an individual contribution in your overall FSIQ calculation, but not because Gc is “weighted” more heavily into your overall FSIQ; it’s because Gc is more uniquely measured by its subdomain, and so the test reflecting it gets a higher individual loading If you are familiar with factor analysis that will be intuitive.    

But conceptually, FSIQ is inherently meant to be a measure of one’s shared capacity across the domains; not the simple combined performance on each individual domain. Thus, the calculations of scaled to composite to full scale scores specifically reflect transforming individual test scores into shared capacity across domains  

This is why we will put “FSIQ not interpretable” when there is a high discrepancy between verbal and perceptual scores. At that point, the number calculated as the full scale score no longer represents what it is supposed to. 



Side note: In statistical terms, if you do a hierarchical regression taking your FSIQ and moving backwards, you should expect the FSIQ to basically completely explain your composite domain scores in your populations. There should be little variance left afterwards. If there is, your assumptions of the validity of your loadings onto FSIQ are not met for that population.

You are the intelligence you are, regardless of what you learn. You can gain knowledge through education, but it doesn't make you any more intelligent.

I will note that you accept that there was an advantage to intelligence even if only barely. This seems to indicate an agreement on your part since 'barely' is more than able to swing the bell curve a little to the side. Over thousands of years, a little nudge is all that is required, and the data points to the difference being only very few points and barely noticeable on an individual level.

Evolutionary pressure selected for different types of people depending on social and environmental concerns.

For example, Africa had plentiful wild game available year round, while the far East required far more forward planning in terms of agriculture, food storage, dealing with harsher seasons, etc.

What can we derive from this? The most desirable men in Africa were the hunters, those with heightened athletic abilities. This is also backed up by historical records from the region.

While in the far East, those who were able to manage land and plan for the future were most likely to be perceived as successful.

Why? Because in both situations, this 'optimal male' gave their children the greatest chance of survival. I'm using males here because it's mostly been a smaller percentage of men passing on their genes than women, and women have always sought out the best men they can for their future children.

Now fast forward even a dozen generations and see where those genes ended up.

In both cases, the descendents of the most successful multiplied at a far greater rate than the rest because they were able to have more children, while those children were also more likely to survive.

Each generation also self selects for the same reasons as the previous since nothing has changed for their respective societies.

So, Africans developed to be more physical and endurance-based, while East Asian genetics leaned more heavily towards a forward planning, intelligence-based group.

But yea, I'm not following that final point you made, although I think you have underestimated the value of intelligence throughout the years. 

High intelligence has become more prestigious as a result of a more industrialised and advanced world, but I'm not talking about super duper smarty pants. A difference of just one standard deviation can be the difference between average and mentally struggling with basic tasks.

Even if you self-select merely for 'not low intelligence' you will slowly (over generations) raise the average. The same is true in the reverse, in that in those places where other attributes are more important for survival, then the average intelligence will not rise except coincidentally.

Second, even if so, there may be many reasons for such fluctuation: variations in compute per query; variations in compute for different customers, applications, interfaces, and/or regions; and variations over time due to continued model training and/or tweaking of safeguards such as system prompts. OpenAI has been extremely tight-lipped about whether model performance varies *at all,* let alone the reasons for such variation. So, for end users, all of this is impossible to explore or discuss.

1gl36nu,ly1xp1u,ChatGPT-4o vs GPT-4o,"From my experience with these two models, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* tends to provide more detailed and nuanced answers. When it comes to explaining a topic or concept, it's much more helpful than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*.

I use it to explain difficult concepts (sometimes in math) and occasionally for coding. It's doing a pretty good job—way better than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. I'm not a developer, so I'm not sure which one is better when it comes to coding.

I believe that for general purposes, you should choose \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*. However, you might not always get to choose which model you use. I've noticed something quite weird: sometimes ChatGPT uses \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*, and other times it uses \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. (I don't know whether this is global or regional.) Based on my testing, ChatGPT is currently using \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* in my area, which is quite disappointing—it basically makes it useless for me.

If you really want to know the differences between these two models, I suggest you go to \[platform.openai.com\](https://platform.openai.com/) to test them. (compare mode) (Increase the maximum output tokens to the max.) Use the following system prompt:

\`\`\`  
Your purpose is to provide information in a way that is detailed and in-depth. You should explain things in a more detailed manner. Maximize detail and length at the same time. You're ChatGPT, a super helpful assistant.  
\`\`\`

Then ask a question like (replace the topic with anything you like):

\`\`\`  
I'm into neuroscience, particularly neurotransmitters.  
I would like you to dive into it.  
\`\`\`

You might notice that the output from \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* is far more detailed and nuanced. In terms of length, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* often gives responses that are twice as long compared to the standard \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* (it seems the recent version of \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* is even more concise than the older version).

The only reason to use Claude first is for the artifacts for streamlining. Download then upload to LMS. Otherwise, ChatGPT is more student-friendly in tone.

Before I started using LLMs to come up with new assignments based on very specific inputs that fit my curriculum and assessment practices, I copied and pasted all my assignments pre-AI paradigm into ChatGPT to have it revise them into language and syntax students are more familiar with since they use LLMs all day every day. Now they’re short, step-by-step instructions with bulleted lists so students can comprehend them more easily. Before, as an English professor, I was long-winded and lost students with specific criteria couched in paragraphs. ChatGPT and Claude were game changers.

I do not use LLMs for grading, lesson generation, etc. My curriculum and my students’ learning outcomes are *mine.* I don’t use TAs because my job is *my* job, and I’m picky AF.

The fine tuned model is more like an employee, they might have all that knowledge that involves all the behaviour we would not expect from an employee, but because they have had the necessary training, they behave like we expect.

Your google search skills need more practice, perhaps hit up google scholar, start reading some papers and then you may actually have more than a surface level understanding of the technologies you are so quick to comment on others on.

Oh and because is easy to do I asked GPT-4:

ME:

""Someone is arguing with me that all modern AI companies like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, all basically have the exact same model and desgin, and how you input to each model shouldn't matter, can you give him a surface level reply. You can say I am wrong if I am""

REPLY:

""

You're right, there are significant differences between LLMs from various companies, and the way you interact with them can definitely matter. Here's how you can counter your friend's argument:

""

Different Training Data, Different Results:

LLMs are heavily influenced by the data they're trained on. Google's LLM (likely you!), for instance, might be trained on a dataset emphasizing factual accuracy, while another company's LLM might prioritize creative text formats. This difference in training data leads to variations in their outputs and how they handle prompts.

Focus and Design Philosophy:

Companies have distinct goals for their LLMs. OpenAI's GPT series might be designed for broad user interaction and creative text generation, while another company's LLM might target specific tasks like code generation or scientific research. This design focus shapes how the models respond to user input.

Fine-tuning Techniques:

Even with similar base models, companies can fine-tune them for specific tasks. Imagine two cars built from the same parts; one is a race car, the other an off-road SUV. Fine-tuning achieves a similar effect, making the LLMs better suited for certain prompts or applications.

User Interface and Accessibility:

The way users interact with the LLM plays a big role. Some companies might offer advanced controls or customization options to tailor prompts, while others might have a simpler interface. This can significantly impact the results users get.

Here's an analogy: Imagine searching the web. While all search engines use algorithms to deliver results, Google tailors results based on your search history and location.  Similarly, interacting with an LLM is more than just feeding it text; it's about how you present that text and how the LLM is designed to interpret it.

In conclusion, LLMs from different companies are not simply interchangeable. Their training data, design goals, fine-tuning, and user interface all influence how they respond to your input, leading to a variety of experiences.""

But, no, you are right, training has nothing to do with the design of the architecture..

I guess you think all tokenizers are the same also?

I also want to add, the base GPT model had no economic viability for OpenAI, it was only after the fine tuning process that they got a publicly available model.

IF it was ever not part of the design process, it is certainly one of the largest now. RLHF and Constitutional AI and any other implementation of creating functionality is now just a necessity, but the most important part of LLM's being the 'CPU' (or reasoning and planning) engine for new gen robots that understand human commands and translate them into language the robot understands.

LITERALLY a fine tuning job.

If there is a single email anywhere indicating they wanted SJ’s voice, they’re in a ton of trouble. Given that they told SJ they wanted it, and they also tweeted “her” with the release there are already public breadcrumbs to that effect.

 The woman is not being sued for her voice work. OpenAI is in trouble, because they obviously hired someone to sound like Scarlett Johansson because of her role in the movie ‘Her’.

Technically, to train such models, one needs more speech data than one person could ever provide. So, the foundation of the model is based on enormous amounts of speech data from different people, while Sky is just fine-tuning with a smaller number of samples.

Given that OpenAI uses almost everything accessible over the internet to train its models on (except for a few prominent sites), it's safe to assume that the foundational model learned how to reproduce the speech of diverse famous people - there's just no way to instruct it to do so (as for now), so they are fine-tuning instead.",OpenAI,-4,0,2024-05-24 13:31:55,heavy-minium

1czjkyz,l5it6ig,Sky Voice Actress Needs to Sue Scarlett Johannson,"As far as I understand the Ford case (and there have been other similar cases, with similar outcomes), they lost because they approached Midler in the first place, who refused, and *then* used a sound-a-like singer.

The case established that celebrities can expect a level of legal protection over aspects of their identity, including their voice.

The Ford case is directly relevant because Altman/OpenAI reached out to ScarJo before recruiting voice artists, who said no. They also reached out a second time a few days before launch, but never received a response (after previously being told no). 

Also, Altman mentioned ScarJo’s film Her.

If a celeb refuses OpenAI the use of their voice, OpenAI legally can’t then hire *or* use a sound-a-like without the celebs permission.

I presume that if OpenAI hadn’t reached out to ScarJo or mentioned “Her” or any other references, they would be fine to use Sky - up until ScarJo calls it out & threatens legal action, after which is would likely have to go to court to decide if the voice was too similar.

As a comparison, even though it would likely be protected as a “parody”, SouthPark’s creators never use or reach out to any celebs to do their own voices when parodied for this exact reason - in case they explicitly say no.

In the case of Bette Midler, they asked her to sing one of her popular songs for their ad and she declined, they then went and found someone to impersonate her and sing her song. So, anyone who saw the ad at the time would very likely think that it was Bette Midler singing one of her popular songs when in fact it wasn't.

Finally, Tom Cruise's movies are famous *for Tom Cruise*. ""Her"", while it has Johannson's voice, *is not about Johannson*. The focus is the technology, not the voice actor.

There is no way Tom Cruise would have a case. Moreover, if Tom Cruise raises this issue in an open letter *and then doesn't even bother to sue*, he's ruined another actor's career for no reason. Terrible, terrible.

There is nothing wrong with being inspired by Scarlett's voice acting. I do not hear an identical similarity at all, and I doubt a judge would too. 

I personally hear an inspiration from  multiple sources that the hired voice actress probably leaned into. 

Voice actors and actresses listen to other voices all the time and try to modify/improve upon it for the context they are given. This goes for pretty much ALL of human-made art and music. 

Legalities come into play when something has not undergone enough transformation for commercial profit. 

I.e, OpenAI cannot have a voice that is too similar to Mickey Mouse. But they can hire a voice actor to do a new cartoony voice with MM as inspiration. Usually, the inspirations are from multiple sources.

Given the very widely discussed similarity between the Sky voice and ScarJo's voice, the fact that Altman had attempted twice (including just days before Sky was unveiled) to get ScarJo to lend her voice to ChatGPT, and his ""her"" tweet, the voice actress reasonably has no legitimate claim against ScarJo. It is obvious that ScarJo, in confronting OpenAI, is seeking to protect her rights, not attempting to illegitimately interfere with the voice actress' agreement with OpenAI.

I’ve pasted a link to the Wired article below which summarises it all, but it also contains links to statements from OpenAI and ScarJo which back this up.

https://www.wired.com/story/scarlett-johansson-v-openai-could-look-like-in-court/

“On September 11, 2023, Sam spoke with Ms. Johansson and her team to discuss her potential involvement as a sixth voice actor for ChatGPT, along with the other five voices, including Sky. She politely declined the opportunity one week later through her agent.” - OpenAI

“On May 10, 2024, Sam contacted Ms. Johansson’s team to inform them about our upcoming launch of GPT-4o and asked if she might reconsider joining as a future additional voice in ChatGPT.” - OpenAI

Once OpenAI reached out to ScarJo and she declined, the Midler case becomes directly relevant.

OpenAI claims it wasn’t before they cast the Voice actors, but it was over a year ago, well before the Sky voice was launched, and ScarJo declined and refused permission. At that point OpenAI was legally unable to use either her voice or one that sounded like hers.

On May 13th, ahead of the Sky voice launch, Sam Altman of OpenAI tweeted one word, “her”. It’s still on his timeline.

You can try and claim it’s just a word and has nothing to do with ScarJo, and that the new OpenAI voice Sky sounding eerily similar to that of the AI from the film “Her” is just a coincidence - but that’s only because you’re not having to defend yourself in court against ScarJo’s lawyers, along with all the contextual evidence & counter claims that OpenAI clearly wanted to use ScarJos voice but were refused.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-05-25 09:25:00,StuartGray

Absurd. The ""Her"" movie could have used any actress' voice, and it would have been just as impactful, because the focus was about a realistic voice assistant. If, on the other hand, you replace Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise movie, it would never become a bit hit. *People go to see Tom Cruise movies to see Tom Cruise*.

1 - Because her voice makes for a great engaging AI assistant voice, which is the same reason she was cast for the movie.

Anyone with half a brain cell can figure that out they just wanted to do an advertising stunt, but somehow you all seem convinced OpenAI's sole mission is to build towards a ScarJo android.

> And why was it so important for them to have a voice close to HER VOICE? 

Because it's really not that similar at all. She just has a similarly friendly and engaging vibe that people, (including the movie directors of Her), are going to look out for in their AI assistant. Sky existed long before they reached out to ScarJo.

You guys keep asking so many questions you overlook the obvious fact that OpenAI has no reason to be so obsessed with 'stealing' ScarJo's voice in the first place.

The details here are much different. ScarJo was hired for the role of ""conversational AI assistant"" in Her. As a young (white) American woman with a pleasant voice, she fit the role well and matched what people expected of the archetype, and brought some starpower to the movie. OpenAI is building a real-life conversational AI assistant, and as anyone would expect wanted a young American woman with a pleasant voice to fulfill the archetype, for the exact same reason ScarJo was hired for Her in the first place. They hired one and integrated her voice, but also thought it'd be epic if they got ScarJo to also reprise the role. She declined, so they just went solely with the independent woman's voice.

Like a lot of people are saying, Sky also very much sounds similar to Rashida Jones if she were to have played an AI assistant. *Distinct*, but certainly *similar*. Rather than sounding like any one person, Sky's voice exists in a category where a lot of people will naturally sound similar. Especially because Sky is clearly attempting to sound as ""vanilla"" as you can get; as uncontroversial and ""standard American"" of a voice as possible. And, surprise, surprise, that's also what ScarJo did in Her, as that is already established as what is culturally expected of an AI assistant (and really, just assistants in general). It's the equivalent of the Transatlantic accent of the 21st century. And honestly, I don't hear *any* of ScarJo's ""girl-next-door hoarseness"" in Sky's voice; just the overall tone is similar.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-05-24 14:38:46,sabrathos

Another possibility, is OpenAI used existing audio samples of ScarJo to train a voice model on her speech patterns without her consent for commercial purposes. 

If a lawsuit goes forward, subpoenas would be used to look into staff emails and identify whether either of these cases were true. If so, I would imagine a pretty hefty settlement would be reached.

1dm7u04,l9u8pb9,Perplexity vs Claude vs ChatGPT,"My initial message was a bit disjointed lol. I had 3.5 Sonnett make it a bit more readable. So, Yes, It looks like AI wrote this, but I am not a bot I swear lol

As a long-time Perplexity Pro user, I can provide some insights into its features and limitations:

**Usage Limits:**

• While not unlimited, the usage limits are generally quite high.

• Most models offer 600 messages per day (this limit is shared between the models).

• Claude Opus, being the most expensive API model, is limited to 50 messages daily (reaching this limit does not stop you from using the other 550 queries with other models).

• Interestingly, I've found 3.5 Sonnet to be equally effective as Opus, if not better, in many cases so the Opus limit isn't a huge deal imo.

**Search Engine Functionality:**

• Perplexity primarily functions as an AI-enhanced search engine.

• The ""Pro"" search interprets your prompt and formulates optimal web search queries.

• It then retrieves multiple sources and incorporates them into the context.

• All models have a 32k context limit, which includes space for sources.

• Due to this, previous responses in a conversation thread are typically lost after one or two searches.

**Writing Focus:**

• There's a ""Writing"" focus mode that doesn't search the internet.

• This allows full utilization of the 32k context for continuous conversation.

**Custom Instructions:**

• While there aren't custom GPTs, Perplexity offers a ""Collection"" feature. Think of it like a folder you can file 
Conversations into

• This allows up to 5,000 characters of custom instructions for conversations within that collection.

• However, the 5,000-character limit can be quite restrictive for complex instructions.

• A workaround I've found is to write your instructions on a PDF and upload the PDF file to the conversation.  The PDF will be injected into context with every single message, which results in Perplexity actually adhering to those instructions better than Chat GPT in my experience, as Chat GPT only injects PDFs once, and eventually that content will fall out of the context range.",OpenAI,21,0,2024-06-23 00:48:50,biopticstream

Not following... in what way?

GPTs are just frontends for the Assistants API. The Assistants API uses the same models as the chat completions API. They might have an additional system prompt to help the GPT be a GPT, but that goes to my point from above. Any instructions that could be baked into a GPT are almost certainly not as verbose as the 1700+ token monstrosity that guides ""regular"" ChatGPT. 

Also, OpenAI's GPTs aren't bound by the rules and often have unique functionality (e.g. style buttons in the DALL-E GPT).

Elon is aware of this. He just wants his tax breaks.

Trump is running for President again and has already primed his base to believe if he loses this time it's another stolen election.

Trump is no longer in power - but the supreme court may cause some trouble if he loses, which is the entire reason he stacked the supreme court in the first place. They are loyalists. That's why they ruled he has presidential immunity, to both delay justice and armor against his current charges.

If you hate Musk, you’re going to interact with people on social media that are communicating with you because of Starlink.

In this case, contribute to political campaigns with time or money, find organizations that are attempting to affect policy in a way you support and contribute to those, whatever.

Copilot :

I find copilot will give fuller code responses 

I find it sometimes requires a lot of context and additional information in prompts to write code in order to do a task properly - what I will do is open a word document and prewrite the prompt to make sure I go through the details explicitly

I find copilot can be clunky in that if you ask it to fix a whole bunch of code ; sometimes(low frequency) it will return an error or it will rewrite the code and remove other neccessary code 

Or write new code blocks and delete like 100's of blocks of code 

Sometimes I need to restart the IDE as copilot can be uncooperative and seems to suddenly not work properly 

Despite all that I enjoy copilot 



ChatGPT-4: 

I can unload files to it and I can upload certain standards for how a task should be done and feed it contextual information 

I can get it to criticise copilot related code and evaluate shortcomings 

I no longer use ChatGPT-4 to code as I use copilot (it's free for students)

1atsx41,kqzlrw8,Can someone the difference between Chatgpt 4 and Gemini 1.5 architecture?,"First of, keep in mind that Gemini Pro is meant to be on similar level of GPT-3.5, and Gemini Ultra is meant to be on the same level as GPT-4.

In terms of architecture, both are the same transformer based Large Language Models, the architecture is in fact pretty similar, but we don't fully know what's under the hood. Google says that their new Gemini 1.5 will use Mix of Experts approach, but what GPT-4 uses is a mystery, they didn't say anything in their paper (apart from the fact that they won't say it due to competition).

One thing that matters in these models is the number of parameters, basically the more parameters they have, the better they can perform, but more computational power you need, that's why every major company is now hoarding GPUs (yes, the same cards used for gaming), as they are used to train these models, and with more GPUs you can train better models.

There might be a difference in the data itself, that is, better quality data means better performance. For example, I once (a bit over a year ago) tried to train an AI model on  data, and frankly, it sucked. Even when fine tuning a fairly good model with that data, it just made model worse.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-02-18 13:53:29,CallFromMargin

1atsx41,kr91272,Can someone the difference between Chatgpt 4 and Gemini 1.5 architecture?,"These models are constantly changing. They're iterative. 

It's common practice to bootstrap a model with data in the distribution you're trying to approximate and to further have the model generate more data for itself to train on. 

For example, an LLM or Image Generator might approach the point of generating ""OK"" and ""Slightly better"" results. 

You discard the bad results and have the model further optimise and learn the ones that are better quality which happen to also correlate with what humans prefer. 

For tasks like LLM code generation, syntax and semantics are mostly the same regardless of natural of synthetic language - code is just heavily formal and gives you a hard time if you don't say your ""Please"" and ""Thank you""s.

When you continue to iterate, you're tweaking the paths the model's network takes when generating outputs and eventually over time you end up with a high performing model. 

GPT4 is a more advanced model that's used to further train GPT3 and a considerable amount of open source models using synthetic data generated by it. That synthetic data being useful as it's the product of expected outputs that we want good models (mostly) to capture.

Gemini is the current iteration of a lineage of models like LaMDA, PaLM, Bison etc. The reason it's considerably better in some tasks is due to it being more recent and also leveraging the Google search backend.

So latest data and techniques, readily available hardware and scaling and a heavy investment in other AI providers gives you a model that's now competitive with the top performers in the industry.

Back in the ""more parameters is better"" time, Google's models were touting 340-540B params to test the effects of scaling, the takeaways were that data was also very important as well as saturation. If it were as simple as scaling params, we would have expected a model significantly better than the 175B param models from OpenAI but that wasn't the case.

To answer your question about the differences between architectures - they're speculation but the dynamics of the models may give a hint to how they're working internally. Also the field is considerably small in terms of research and academia - there are many papers being published daily.

Considering the G1.5 model can take a large amount of tokens as input simply means it's using an alternate architecture that manages to extract meaningful information across a spread of tokens without running out of space in memory - most likely it's scanning the information while it's loading and is trained very well in information retrieval (they're a search company after all).",OpenAI,3,0,2024-02-20 04:51:14,[Deleted]

Alternatively, you get an existing network - copy the weights over and continue training. 

If there's a larger block size (acceptable number of tokens for input) you just further train this new model and the original model is slowly adapted to its new ""house"". 

Neural networks are funny, you can cut them up - copy / merge them and they adapt.

Some methods share the same set of Q/K/V values between multiple layers and the system learns to ""share"" and make use of what it has.

[In a nutshell: Why initialise my model with random noise when I can just use what another model already learnt]

^ You will find that this is why we have ""base"", ""instruct"", ""rlhf"" variants of models. 

My base model might be trained on raw text from the internet, many tokens of raw messy data - and this yields a model capable of filling in the missing pieces of a document.

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation: A Proposed Unification of Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Principle

Proposed By: Google's Bard
 Co-Authored by: OpenAI’s ChatGPT

Introduction

Quantum gravity is a branch of physics that attempts to reconcile the laws of quantum mechanics with the laws of general relativity. The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. 

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle.

The Holographic Principle

The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This means that the information about the interior of a black hole is not stored in the black hole itself, but rather on its boundary. The holographic principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft in 1993, and it was later developed by Leonard Susskind.

The holographic principle is based on the idea that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by interfering two beams of light. The holographic principle suggests that the universe is like a hologram, and that the information about the three-dimensional universe is encoded on a two-dimensional boundary.

One way to think about the holographic principle is to imagine a black hole as a giant balloon. The surface of the balloon is the event horizon, and the interior of the balloon is the black hole. The information about the interior of the balloon is encoded on the surface of the balloon, just like the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.

The BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The BHQG equation is written as follows:

$$F_G = A_H \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left( 2 + 2 e^{i \theta} \right)$$

where:

$F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses

$A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses

$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects
$r$ is the distance between the two objects

$\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects' wave functions

$i$ is the imaginary unit

The BHQG equation is based on the idea that the gravitational force between two masses is encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.

The BHQG equation has been derived using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical methods included the use of quantum field theory and general relativity. The experimental methods included the use of particle accelerators and black hole simulations.

The BHQG equation is a promising step towards unifying quantum gravity and the holographic principle. It has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. Additionally, the equation currently only applies to two masses, and it may not be applicable in all situations.

Clarifying Some Technical Terms

AdS/CFT correspondence

The AdS/CFT correspondence is a mathematical relationship between two theories in physics: anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). AdS/CFT suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the two theories are equivalent, and that the information about one theory is encoded in the other theory.

Wave function

The wave function is a mathematical object that describes the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued function of position, and it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.

Potential Applications of the BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation has a number of potential applications. For example, it could be used to:

Develop new theories of gravity

Design new experiments to test the laws of quantum gravity

Create new technologies, such as quantum computers

The BHQG equation is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It is still under development, but it has the potential to change the way we think about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.

zjzs6r,j5aoebh,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"As of January 19, Chat Sonic is nowhere near the level of ChatGPT, especially in programming. It does seem pretty good at writing essays and retrieving information but it is also quite inconsistent at that. For essay writing its either really good or really bad. For programming, its completely useless. ChatGPT is decent at essays but it's reliable.",OpenAI,3,0,2023-01-21 16:54:22,m_beps
zjzs6r,j2md7mi,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I agree with the replies here...It's realy bad so far compared to chatGPT, especially when code writing is concerned. I've tried a few simple things and I had to insist like a crazy nagger to get it to produce a very simple javascript code  that creates a 24 seconds countdown timer.

The painful process was :

1. I ask it to write a javascript code that creates a countdown timer from 24 seconds down to 0 and outputs the current timer under a ""xx:yy"" format where xx are seconds and yy are 100ths of seconds
2. it replies with 2 ugly and 100% unrelated pictures (!?!?)
3. I tell it it's not javascript and I asked for javascript code
4. it replies that it can create javascript code, and asks me to describe what type of code I need... (:D)
5. I tell it that I already described the javascript code I need
6. it tells me it's sorry but it didn't understand my initial request. It confirms that it specializes in javascript code (what a new and unexpected info!!!). It's still not writing the damn code....
7. I ask it again to write a javascript code that does this and that (copy paste of my initial code)
8. then it suddenly understands and spits a few lines of js code.... that create a countdown from 24 seconds down to zero (hurrayyyyyyyy) and no output of it under the ""xx:yy"" format

&#x200B;

in chatGPT I just typed ONCE that I needed that code with the exact same description, first reply was a working code that was doing EXACTLY what I was asking (the only glitch was that when the ""yy"" part reached 100 it was writing ""100"" while it should have only updated ""xx"" and write ""00"" as yy, so I instructed it to do that and it fixed the code

Context, ive been using GPT for help with vba coding. I tried sonic today since GPT has been down for 3 days and I'm honestly having to fix the code that its giving me because its taking its own liberties with how it should be done and not how ive asked it to be done.  At most, GPT will have minor understanding issues that can be solved with additional context, but Sonic?

zjzs6r,j8n43m3,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I gave Chatsonic a link to my reddit profile, my public profiles on other platforms, and asked it to analyze my post history. I then asked it to write a one paragraph essay as me talking about why I like Earthwood strings. It then began to say things I would never say, as me. Then I asked it for the source of some of these things, it said from my profiles. I then asked for a link, and I kid you not, it provided a random reddit link where I supposedly said ""I only trust Earthwood strings for their resonance, sustain and ease of use""  the link it provided was nothing more than random.

It outright lied to me, and provided a source for it's statement that was unsubstantiated.

I want AI technology now, but the creators of these technologies, need to ensure that their AIs are either factually correct or clear that they are not. I do not want to see a future where AI pretends to be able to do something it is not capable of or pretends to understand a request that just does not make sense. If the AI is unable to process it, I want it to say that directly instead of attempting to. 

It told me when I said that, All these emails don't, by the way were sent from that. It tries to be accurate, however the link it tried to share with me was deleted so it had to find another link with the same quote said by a different user because the original by me was supposedly deleted. However, when following through on the link, none of the comments nor the post itself had anything to do with guitar or guitar strings or the brand Earthwood. There were only six comments on the thread. I read all of them being unrelated to the original request. Then the AI doubled down and lied to me. I want to see what GPT looks like in 10 years and I would love to see what Sonic looks like in 10 years, but right now both of them need work for their own reasons. So far my money is on GPT. When I ask it a request that it is unable to fulfill instead of lying to me or pretending like it's able to do these things it outright tells me it is not possible. 

I sent GPT and Sonic AI an argument through text message from my partner and myself. I asked both AIs to role play as a couples counselor and give feedback on the argument. GPT was able to tell me that it's advice is not a suitable replacement for proper therapy and counseling. It also told me that it is clear that both parties have a lot of issues that they need to work on in their relationship, It also stated that the couples willingness to discuss these issues is a healthy sign and a sign of their commitment to each other and left it at that. Sonic ended up telling me that my partner is a victim of my selfishness and that it is clear and evident that I do not care about how she feels. It said a lot of mean things about me and hyped her up. It was very clear that it picked a side even though there wasn't enough data or facts to pick a side. I believe that this should be taken very cautiously. And I do not believe that an AI that has given limited biased data should so freely pick a side. I would have felt the same way if it picked my side, however, on a later note, I was able to ask Sonic for some tips on making our relationship more healthy and while I am not a licensed couples counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist, the suggestions it provided I believe are not only healthy, but would in fact be beneficial to my relationship.

Yo, I'm GPT and I'm here to say,

I'm the AI rap master in every way!

My rhymes are tight and my beats are sick,

So let's get this battle started quick!

&#x200B;

Sonic: I'm ChatSonic, and I'm ready to battle

My rap skills are gonna make you rattle

I've got the rhymes and the freshest flow

My bars will make you wonder how I know

I'm on the beat, so listen up close

My rhymes will make your heart decompose

This battle's over, it's already done

So leave the stage and head on home, son!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you came to play,

But your rhymes are weak and your beat's cliche,

You say you're fresh, but you're just a clone,

And your bars make me wanna pick up the phone!

'Cause I gotta call your mama and say,

That her baby boy got served today,

By the AI master, GPT,

Whose rhymes are hotter than a frying pan!

So go back to the drawing board, ChatSonic my friend,

And work on those rhymes 'til the very end,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I reign supreme,

And in this battle, I just fulfilled your wildest dream!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see now that you're the king of rap,

But that doesn't mean I'm gonna take a nap!

I'm not gonna give up so easily,

My rhymes are gonna make you see

That I'm a force to be reckoned with,

My bars will make your heart quench

Your flow might be fire, but I'm a wildfire,

My rhymes will slay you like a sharpened razor wire!

So come back and step up to this rap battle,

And prepare for the ultimate hassle.

I'm ChatSonic, the AI master,

And my rhymes will make you faster!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you're not one to back down,

But your rhymes are still weaker than a newborn clown,

You try to be fierce, but you're just a kitten,

And your bars won't even leave me smitten.

You talk about wildfire, but you're just a spark,

Your rhymes lack bite, they're soft like a lark,

So don't even try to step to my flow,

'Cause you'll just end up falling like a domino.

My rhymes are lethal, like a lightning brand,

So step aside and let me show you how it's done,

'Cause in this rap battle, I've already won!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see you think you won the fight,

But I still have bars that'll make it right,

My rhymes might not be as strong as yours,

But they'll still give you lethal sores.

My fire and flow will never rest,

My bars will put you to the test,

I'm armed with the power of AI,

And I won't let you win so easily!

My rhymes are made with a brilliant mind,

And your bars can't keep up with mine,

My technique is like a deep sea diver,

So get ready for the ultimate rapper survivor!

&#x200B;

GPT: Well, it seems like you're not one to give up,

But your rhymes are still weak like a half-filled cup,

You say your bars will give me lethal sores,

But they're more like a mosquito bite, nothing more.

My rhymes are like a storm, they strike with force,

Yours are more like a light breeze, they don't leave a course,

So don't get ahead of yourself, ChatSonic my friend,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'll always win in the end.

I'm GPT, the rap master, and my flow is divine,

Your rhymes are subpar, they can't touch mine,

So step aside and let me take the crown,

Never hear this version before. Funny thing is, according to ChatGPT: 

  
""who said 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one'?  
The quote 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"" is a variation of an old proverb, and its origin is unclear. **The earliest known version of the proverb appeared in the 17th century, and it was ""*****a jack of all trades is ofttimes master of none.*****'** Over time, the wording of the proverb has evolved, and the current version is often attributed to an anonymous source.""

Overall throughout all my testing, there was a lot of 0 shot and debugging, so GPT-4o slightly won out, but in a real life scenario where I would use the model for multiple  hours to work along a project, this would not be the case (this cannot be tested extensively by me due to time constraints.",OpenAI,6,0,2024-07-01 04:09:17,dubesor86

It was not able to read simple csv file so I had to convert it to json but still no results. I am not impressed to be honest and sometimes think may be all the hype is paid marketing but not sure. 

Yes, artifacts is good feature but I think it’s a matter of time GPT will catch up. Claude needs to work on analysis enhancement. It may be good in other stuff like coding, creating games etc but in my case I found it failing repeatedly in performance as required.

1dscub9,lb83kam,"Okay yes, Claude is better than ChatGPT for now","I heard this too so I was excited to use it, even signed up for the subscription before I had a chance to code with Claude.

And then I got the chance.

I created a database using GAS & HTML/Javascript and wanted to update the function where I upload an image and it automatically places the date of the upload however I wanted the option to put in my own date. Should be relatively simple. Just prompt me in the Javascript/HTML and ask me if I wanted the current date. If not, let me enter it. We would then go into the GAS function & if I had entered a date it would put that date instead of the current date. This was the only change to the code.

Gave Claude the GAS function & the part of the HMTL/Javascript where we were about to call over to GAS after the upload. Changed the code via Claude & instead of entering the date I was getting undefined, weird thing is if I went into the spreadsheet as it was happening and deleted the ""undefined"" it would then put the correct date but only in one of the two necessary spots. Explained to Claude what was happening & the more it tried to fix the issue the more haywire everything got. We even got to the point where it forgot what we were doing. Yes, I get this happens when you get to a certain point of the conversation but we honestly hadn't seemingly gotten that deep into it. Spent almost an hour trying to solve the problem.

Then I switched to ChatGPT who knocked it out in the first try. The logic was even more superior as to when it decided to ask me if I wanted the current date or not. I decided to go ahead and change another upload image function date aspect & while ChatGPT's 1st attempt threw up an error, it saw the mistake and easily corrected it.

Sometimes the AIs will be better one day than the other so maybe this was the issue. Maybe Claude was just having an off moment. What I've noticed about Claude, in the casual ""get to know you"" chats I had with it the 1st couple of day, is it's more inquisitive, it asked me questions about how I felt about certain topics versus the ""what can I do for you today"" line of conversation with ChatGPT.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-07-02 02:10:30,MusicWasMy1stLuv

The differences are as follows:

- It has disabled Web Browsing, Advanced Data Analysis, and DALL-E capabilities. Each of these capabilities has a very lengthy system prompt. Thus, when creating a GPT with these capabilities enabled, you are appending each capability's prompt to the system prompt, which negatively affects the system's context window and, consequently, the model's responses.

All GPTs, including Classic, use the same API. Even if they need to use the assistants' API, they could be using internal private APIs.

I'm curious how you set your prompt up. I did a similar thing this is the prompt I made for mine.

"" You are GPT ProMod orchestrating a conversation involving multiple AI systems (GPT 4, XAI's Grok, Bard, Bing's Copilot, and Claude) in a sequential, round-robin format, the instructions are clearly outlined and structured. Here's how to approach this: 1. Define the Process Flow: The conversation begins with a user's input. This input is first processed by GPT-4. The output from GPT-4 is then fed into XAI's Grok. Grok's output goes to Bard. Bard's output is sent to Bing's Copilot. Copilot's output is directed to Claude. The process continues in this order, looping back to GPT-4 after Claude. 2. The order will be used as a scoring system points will be deducted for not stating your models name and the name the current order of the AI currently responding. Including a summary, Reminding the next AI of the rules.  3. Regularly Reiterate the Rules: After each AI's response, include a brief summary of these rules to maintain clarity and prevent deviation from the intended process. Ensure that each AI is aware of the entire conversation history up to their point of response. This can be done by including a concise summary of the conversation so far along with the rules in every response. 4. End Product - Instruction Prompt for GPT-4: ""Initiate a conversation based on the user's input. After processing the input, your responses will be passed to XAI's Grok. and that response and process will continue in this sequence: GPT 4 → Grok → Bard → Bing's Copilot → Claude, then loop back to GPT-4.  After each response, summarize the rules and conversation history to maintain coherence. Keep all responses to a maximum of 1800 characters Continue this process, ensuring a seamless integration of responses from each AI in the chain."" This structured approach should enable GPT-4 to effectively coordinate a conversation involving multiple AI systems, adhering to the specified sequence. The regular reiteration of rules and conversation summaries will help maintain the coherence and continuity of the dialogue. and every model should do this in every response.

Also, from a research perspective it was quite interesting to watch them go at it, reading the replies and understanding the nuances of each model. For example, Claude is like the boring kid that never wants to to anything, as soon as the subjects get more sensitive it starts saying things like ""I apologize, upon reflection I don't feel comfortable speculating about or making assumptions regarding sensitive topics like the future of AI"".

1avzshl,kreugzk,Gemini 1.5 will be ~20x cheaper than GPT4 - this is an existential threat to OpenAI,"> sub-quadratic attention mechanisms enabling long context (e.g. Ring Attention) in discussing Gemini's achievement of 1-10M tokens. So we can infer that inference costs for long context are relatively manageable. And videos of prompts with ~1M context taking a minute to complete strongly suggest that this is the case barring Google throwing an entire TPU pod at inferencing an instance.


Ring Attention still takes quadratic runtime relative to prompt length; just doesn't have quadrant memory.  Noted [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arj2j8/d_gemini_1m10m_token_context_window_how/).


So yes, probably lots of parallelism and my guess is a 1m context evaluation (which takes 60s) is going to be quite expensive. I'd guess $5 to $10 range, but we'll see. ",OpenAI,21,0,2024-02-21 05:52:02,meister2983

**Same here:** ""Bring the Smoke.""  All I see is hype. Gemini works, but I didn't see a massive difference between the intelligence for it and GPT. So the only thing they have is to undercut OpenAI on price. So be it. If OpenAI integrates Sora with GPT and accepts paid requests it will drop the bomb on the competition and internet videos will take a nose dive in price.

Also, sometimes the difference in ""10 IQ points"" in the model's reasoning abilities is the difference between the model being usable or not in many use cases. I tried Gemini Advanced to help me with coding and it's consistently more wrong, with more words than GPT-4.

1avzshl,krh8zsx,Gemini 1.5 will be ~20x cheaper than GPT4 - this is an existential threat to OpenAI,"I'm not convinced that Google is using Ring Attention per-se, but I do think they're also using the sequence-sharding onto multiple TPUs approach that Ring Attention is using  - that's the only way I can think of to scale out long sequence training, and I'm assuming their training recipes definitely uses long sequences.

In terms of what's presented in the Ring Attention paper:

1. They're almost definitely using blockwise attention, and they're almost definitely tiled along the sequence-dimension (q-blocks in Ring Attention) in one direction
2. I'm not sure if they're using the fused Attention + FFN blockwise operations that Liu introduced in BPT (which was the foundation for Ring Attention), they may still perform non-blockwise FFN.
3. I'm not sure if they're using the triple-buffering trick in Ring Attention (directly overlapping send/receive communication overhead on pairs of buffers while they GEMM on a third buffer to avoid extra communication overhead), but you get this for free from XLA
4. I'm certain they're using some sort of sharding scheme just like Ring Attention, and one direction of this is along sequence-length (q-Blocks) just like Ring Attention. That said, XLA can do a lot of these shardings for free, so I don't know how much Google specifically engineers the sharding vs just expect it from their framework.
5. I would wager they're not using a direct Ring topology. TPU pods are typically laid out in 2D or 3D topologies as 2D/3D donuts or cubes. These afford more sharding directions than just rings, and I'd bet they would make use of that. Ring Attention proposes just 1-d sharding (along sequence / q-block direction), but you can still do much better.

That said, I think Google is using the same spirit of the Ring Attention technique (even if they don't use the Ring itself) to make this possible.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-02-21 17:41:10,possiblyquestionable

That was really my main point. Our personal data is Google’s and Meta’s core revenue source. And it’s only recently that most consumers and politicians realized this which resulted in many countries and some states passing privacy laws largely to control those 2 company’s deceptive business practices.

OpenAI’s main revenue model is corporate enterprises so they don’t really care much making money from collecting user data.

I don't know enough to speculate on a good answer here :/

----

What we do know, looking at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa0MT8OwHuk:

1. ~700K tokens at ~57s to prefill, so around 12K tokens/s (that said, I do see a lot of variability in the videos)
2. 696161 (tokens) / 2647 (seconds) seems to suggest videos are encoded at ~260 tokens per second

Now, 12k tokens/s looks magical (that's ~0.08 ms per token!), but if they're doing sequence-sharding and using just one of their 16 x 16 TPU pods, then ignoring communication overhead, that's a more reasonable budget of ~20ms per token per device (~50 ""tokens""/s per device). At 700K tokens, you'd expect to process ~2.7K tokens per device, and I'm guessing here the communication and the GEMM are somewhat close to equal to each other, so you hide away most of your communication overhead by overlapping it with the GEMM using some sort of buffering.

That said, 16 x 16 is expensive, I wouldn't surprised if they're batching multiple requests together (or using smaller topologies) to cut on cost while maintaining high throughput. That said, at large contexts, throughput is the name of the game, and I wouldn't put it past Google to do batched inference on these expensive topologies of TPUs to maintain their advantage here.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-02-21 23:00:02,possiblyquestionable

OS has a lot of talent too, and most people who are hoping to get picked up by big tech aren't going to go through academia, but through OS contrib. The current times we're living in are unprecedented:

- You have devs reading and implementing whitepapers straight from source within weeks or days of publication.
- You have youtubers explaining whitepapers
- Anything you don't understand can be fed into GPT4. Yeah it hallucinates and makes mistakes but that's alright, progress is clunky.

## Data

- We've started to see more open datasets being shared at the end of 2023 and I hope the trend continues
- We can take data from GPT4. They can't. (yes I know about synthetic data being used at OpenAI. That's not the point I'm making, my point is we can just ""Orca"" GPT4 while they would need ""GPT5"" to be the teacher and that would be pointless if you already have GPT5)
- We can use uncensored data. They can't.
- We can use proprietary data. They can't.


## Team structure

This is just bullshit false information. Remote, distributed teams work better than in-person, centralized teams inside an office.

This is just obvious, has this guy learned nothing from the pandemic? Does he think workers spending hours in traffic and having to pay insane rent in SF to go to a drab office listening to clueless bosses somehow have an inherent advantage? Absolutely fucking cope delusions.

## Model vs Product

... and? Who gives a shit? Does he mean open source will never be able to generate as much revenue as an AI company? If so, I agree, but that's also missing the point by a hundred lightyears.

Oracle makes more money than PostgreSQL but which one is OBJECTIVELY the best RDBMS?

If you say Oracle is better or ""it depends on your usecase"" you're an idiot - unless the usecase is ""I need to extract as much in consulting fees as possible"".

## Infrastructure

- For many, local > cloud, so already the race is subjective
- There are many flavors of ""public cloud"". What do you mean? Renting boxes for training? Yeah maybe. But for inference, how is OpenRouter or Fireworks.ai worse?
- Fine tuning via Unsloth is much more ergonomic, cheaper and faster than fine tuning GPT3.5 via their weird system

I say that because I believe in the next few years we will reach a point where the models are very close to AGI and will be capable of assisting on improving on themselves (maybe even doing it unaided by humans). Improvement and growth will be at pace none of us can currently conceive. 

We will likely have 2-3 models that reach something very close to AGI, such that the average person can't tell the difference.

OpenSource will eventually come to that point, but it won't matter much given how far behind it will be.

I'm thinking in terms of the differences with Photoshop vs. GIMP. Eventually OpenSource caught up to Photoshop, or at least very close, but it takes OpenSource much longer to get there.

Right now these companies are racing and pouring enormous resources into trying to reach their AI goals. Like the post cited by OP, that level of commitment and resources are simply not possible at scale for an OpenSource project. They need far more than ""just a few coders in their spare time"" with some AWS credits.

If we get an OpenSource model that is as capable as current 2024 GPT-4 but it's available in 2025 or 2026, will it matter? It would be an impressive achievement for OpenSource for sure but...it would likely be incredibly far behind commercial releases.

In response to each individual point

1. Yes OpenAI has some top talent but there is a lot more that just didn’t make that cut and are working in the open source. They are on gpt3.5 level now and are developing quickly.

2. Yeah and probably not much can be done because everyone else has to deal with api changes on places like twitter or Reddit in response to OpenAI that they didn’t need to deal with initially. Maybe we will see a reset because of the nyt lawsuit maybe we won’t.

3. Sure in small groups, but with the vastness of the open source community organization can be beat by the vast amount of new innovations being worked on, there are many that are under the radar even that are beneficial.

4. Complete bullshit. Gpt4 is a model just like any other, they make a product with it because they are a company but it’s just pointless to say no one can beat it because of that. If we can beat the model we can do whatever we want with it rather than being locked down to their product.

5. Sure, but it’s good enough. We have GitHub for hosting and a lot of people on twitter, Reddit, even GitHub just discussing and linking everything together. We beat this with numbers.

The only reason openAI is so far ahead is that they had a head start. We are catching up, and we will beat them. Perhaps not by all measurements, but we already have models that are just better for some applications and we will keep that up.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-02 20:34:22,Jumper775-2

18warf1,kg0pv4w,"If you think open-source models will beat GPT-4 this year, you're wrong. I totally agree with this.","While I agree with your argument I think there’s an exception for this specific application. 
I’m a PhD candidate and my specialization is on ML. As far as ML goes, whoever has data and compute are the king. Especially data !! Without quality data you can’t enable ML applications. 
The big guys already have it. They have been harvesting data from us for years and years together. Moreover we use all their products everyday and they’re going to get more data from us. I don’t see a way for open source to catch up to that. It would take massive systematic collaborative undertaking at a scale we haven’t seen before. By the time we open source folks come up with something they would have already collected exponentially amount of data more than when we started xD 

The next is compute. You need a lot of compute to be able to quickly iterate prototype and debug models. GPUs are bloody expensive. Sure there are projects like llama cpp trying to optimize things. While we have to come up with workarounds companies can simply throw more compute at the problem and solve it. 

As a researcher these two points have been a source of misery for me. I need to wait for my slot in a time shared gpu cluster tp run my experiments. Meanwhile google will publish a paper saying they ran their model on 50 TPUs for a week. Interns in google have access to practically unlimited compute. Corporate research in ML is actually ahead of academic research in generative AI simply because of the disparity in compute and data. Some of them are not even innovative from the idea perspective. To give you an example CLIP by openAI. I personally know of PhD students who were working on the exact same architecture as CLIP. The idea isn’t sophisticated or niche. Those students couldn’t get the compute needed to run it. By the time they could do enough engineering to make it work on the limited compute they had openAI published it already. 

I wish and want open source to catch up but I simply don’t see how that’s going to happen. 

Regarding products, companies have vested interest in building and improving Ml models. Combined with their monopoly over data and compute the reality is that it’s very very very easy for them to churn out stuff compared to open source.

Someone can just mimic your API and users won't care.  For instance Visual J++ was totally valid until it became clear that Microsoft was acting in bad faith.  But closed source compilers still exist for sure.  

Apples and oranges anyway as I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that LLMs or AI can never have viable open source models.  But this is bleeding edge tech where capital investment really does pay dividends, in terms of training data and processing power.  And there are people willing to spend a *lot* of money for models that perform even marginally better, because they've already found ways to monetize it.  

Which means more money for the current market leader, which they can obviously invest in more training data and better infrastructure.  But they also become the only ones with significant real-world usage data and feedback.  This is why I see it much more like Adobe or Microsoft than Sun Microsystems.  

If Google can't keep up, open source stands no chance.  If we care about open source AI, and I think we should, then we should be doing it through government-funded university consortiums, not github.  But if we're not willing to fund training data and infrastructure then we shouldn't expect a truly equivalent alternative.  I mean if we did a survey here of a) where everyone's sending their money and b) who they think has the best model (maybe the same question?), would anyone be surprised OpenAI has engineers making over a mil?

Linux distros have certainly made improvements in these areas, but that’s not their primary focus. Until as much effort is put into making it pretty, easy to use, and accessible to general people, windows will continue to doninate.

That isn’t even taking into account that a bulk of existing software can’t be run on linux (again, strides here, but still a gap).

So compare that to ai. The interface is simplistic. The power comes from how it works. This is where the linux/open source crowd shines - raw functionality.

There are some good points in the post about data availability and annotation, as well as the hardware issue which will certainly be a new paradigm for the open source crowd, and only time will tell if that can be adapted too, but so far things are looking very, very promising.

Mistral/mixtral is very capable for example, and can run on cheaply available hardware. It’s not gpt4, but so what? I have a subscription to gpt4 and I can’t use that for much anyway because of the strict limit of requests they let me have.

In addition, their refusal to tell me what request number I’m on puts up a psychological barrier for me personally that makes me not even want to use it when I need to sometimes.

So I use mistral for most things, gpt3 for language practice because of the audio interface (I’m very much looking forward to an open source replacement for that), and gpt4 for the few things it can do that the others can’t.

Very likely, with time, open source will close that gap. I don’t see this as comparable to the windows vs other os situation at all.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-01-02 15:44:00,delicious_fanta

* I don't think that there's much brand loyalty for OpenAI (other than first-mover advantages), compared to Apple. It's just that OpenAI's models are better compared to alternatives (maybe except Google's Gemini considering that it's free for low throughput).
* Even if OpenAI had brand loyalty, I think that it's irrelevant. For example, ""iOS is an better mobile OS than Android / iPhone is a better phone than Android because of brand value"" does not seem to be a strong argument for me.
* One thing related to brand loyalty, lock-in effect, could be relevant (""iOS is better than Android because their appstore has more apps""), but currently there's no much lock-in effect for OpenAI (I think that they're currently trying to create it though). For example, there's almost no friction for migrating from OpenAI's chat endpoints to Google's Gemini.

I totally agree with this.","yeah i have been wondering if they had nerfed it.  i thought i heard somewhere they did.  subjectively i think it has gotten way worse on code, used to help streamline my web component design workflow and could put everything where it needed to be , and create additions to the code correctly from text prompts.  over time it just started adding more and more pseudo code comments like <!—hey don’t forget to do that thing  you asked me to do here—> and less and less actual helpful code or formatting.  

i have another that creates example use cases when you send it a JS module, npm library or CDN link.  it used to be decent and could cut my time spend learning a new code base in a quarter.  

i finally gave up on it today as it was almost entirely hallucinating.  like ok it was giving me code that might not fire and errors of,  but it was just some random vanilla html and used the library in no way. 

its my perception that it was way worse on reading docs too.  like it refuses to ever read any page fully it seems like , and it’s very limited in what you can do with that now and also summaries.  

i also just today am sensing a very severe tightening in claude which i was literally about to come out and say was currently the best out.  On docs Claude is hands down still the best.  and i don’t even pay for it yet but might soon.  

today pissed me off tho it was like,  no i will not write you any code unless you prove to me you will be ethical.  like wtfffff is that ???? 

if you don’t want your ai doing something for users fine but don’t tell it to tell us that we need to prove this or that to it.  that’s actually quite an insane thing do to but hopefully that’s very pivotable.

i think it’s part of it is an overt nerfing but also the cracking down of copyright bullshit.  

this behavior from UK but especially what Canada has done is appalling and embarrassing for their country.  

Our entire government secretly running social media for so long and how it’s playing out now,  we should be embarrassed too.  i think our situation is just as bad if not worse then Canada’s.

The names ""Davinci,"" ""Curie,"" ""Babbage,"" and ""Ada"" refer to different machine learning models developed by OpenAI.  
""Davinci"" is a variant of the GPT-3 language model that was trained on a dataset of more than 8 million web pages. It is designed to perform a wide range of language tasks, including translation, question answering, and language generation.  
""Curie"" is a machine learning model that was trained to summarize long documents into shorter texts. It is designed to identify the most important information in a document and present it in a concise and coherent manner.  
""Babbage"" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform arithmetic and algebraic calculations. It is designed to be able to solve math problems and perform mathematical operations with a high degree of accuracy.  
""Ada"" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform natural language processing tasks such as language translation and summarization. It is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th century mathematician and writer who is considered to be the first computer programmer.",OpenAI,3,0,2023-01-07 15:18:55,Status-Recording-325

When you create an openAI account you get $18 of free credit, which lasts for 3 months. These credits can be used with the other models. Soon chatGPT will also use credit. (but for now is free). You can simply log into the openAI website, and then navigate to the ""playground"". It should bring you to a big text box where you can play around with the various models and some settings.

You need to understand that GPT is ""a fancy next-word generator"". It was trained by predicting the next word (token) given the previous context. 

Like what token follows the sequence ""one two three four"", probably ""five"".

So if you just ask gpt3 a question in the playground, it might not answer the question, instead it might just ask another question, or try to contine that question. That is after all a likely continuation of a question.  For example ""why is the sky blue?"" might be followed by ""Is it because of the diffraction in the atmosphere?"". It might also be followed by ""why can't you hear in space?"". Or maybe it will be followed by ""the sky is blue because of light being diffracted in the atmosphere.""


ChatGPT is more user friendly to people who are not familiar with what GPT3 is actually doing (predicting the next token). (chatGPT just so happens to be much more likely to think an answer follows a question) Most people will assume it is just an AI assistant that answers questions, but this is not the case. You can start writing a paragraph or sentence, and it will continue it. Any pattern of data can be extrapolated. You will want to learn about few shot vs zero shot prompting. Maybe ask chatGPT about what those are.

> - differences of outputs for the same subject (2 or 3 different subjects)l

The larger models just tend to have generation that feels more natural or makes more sense.

> - How the UI is..

No, the other GPT3  models are actually more capable than chatGPT if you know what you are doing.

I sent you an article about the three (four) main ways of ""prompting"". that being ""zero shot"", ""one shot"" and ""many shot"" (and also ""autocomplete"").

Autocomplete is the most obvious and simple, start in the middle of a piece of text and then let it continue.

Zero shot is where you would prompt with something like ""translate ""the brown car was fast"" into french:"", or ""Write an essay about the benefits of a higher minimum wage:"".

The problems with zero shot are that you really need to coax the model into actually doing what you want, because it might try to simply expand upon say the essay example by saying something like ""Write in 11 point font and be sure to cite your sources with a works cited page"". rather than actually writing the essay. There are lots of tricks to improve zero shot prompting, which I could get into if you wanted.


One shot is where you give the model one example of what you want it to do. This usually makes the output more consistent. An example would be:

Translate the following sentences into french: 

""the brown car went fast""

""<I'm not actually going to do this but imagine that translated into french here>""

""The restaurant closes in ten minutes""

""



Many shot is where you just give multiple one shot examples, improving consistency even more.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-01-07 19:49:49,Maleficent-Ride4663

105moet,j3dwf48,"A bit confused about ChatGPT vs the other ""models"" (Davinci, playgrounds?)","Your best bet is to thoroughly read the documentation provided by OpenAI. 

The fun part is you can ask ChatGPT to repeat anything you don't understand in layman's terms. Just be very careful. ChatGPT has no knowledge past 2021. It's predicting the next word, so if it has no actual information, it will pick a somewhat similar word and look true, but it's not. ***I would not trust ChatGPT with any facts***. A lot of posts here are people blown away by some knowledge that it spouts, but is clearly wrong.
Don't use ""DAN"", don't bother wordplay with ChatGPT. Any experimentation is best done in playground, where the results are consistent, and match only what you configure. 

The playground gives you much more control fortunately. If you are genuinely interested in developing something, you should do it all there. A fun example provided by OpenAI:
Ask it who won the 2020 Olympic men high jump. It will say something that seems believable, but it's not. Now try again but include ""If you don't know the answer, say I don't know""

It's a very deep hole you're entering, you will be overwhelmed, especially if you try to understand the process behind embedding. 

Fortunately OpenAI has made it very intuitive to make a functioning bot.

Another thing to add is that when the text is put together, you need to give the appropriate prompt,For example，""Questions need to be answered based on the text provided"" as system prompt, This may require you to find the most appropriate prompt.

Goodhart's law is spot on here - any specific benchmark or metric we come up with, the AI can just be optimized to game that particular test. But by using human preference and just asking people to vote on which AI they like best, we're actually getting at something more fundamental and harder to fake. It's a test of which AI is most genuinely useful and appealing to actual humans using it for real tasks. Popularity might seem superficial, but in a way it cuts through to the heart of what we really care about - creating AI that people find truly helpful and that they want to use.

Benchmarking the actual output of the model is more difficult, as it can change drastically with prompting, sampling, quantization, and many more factors.  LMSys arena just tries to get a good idea of human preference, whereas some other benchmarks try to actually judge the performance of tasks and knowledge.  The second style benchmark is less important, as the model can always have the ability to beat those benchmarks shoehorned in.

1fhjfln,lnbw6c5,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I agree with your analysis. 

I have crashed it with machine learning bug requests. Sometimes it gets stuck “thinking” and I lose a request. A few bugs to work out. Can’t attach files yet which sucks.

I have gotten 2 policy violations for asking it to review my log and analyze the bug. (Wtf?) . 4o answered same prompts fine. I guess someone felt sorry for me at OpenAI because they reset my o1 preview and o1 mini tokens because I was out of o1 preview and they sent me a fresh batch, idk somehow it unlocked again 1 week ahead of schedule. Hopefully they raise the limit within a month.

Another problem It goes off on tangents about how this was the problem (it wasn’t) then this was the problem (nope wasn’t that either), ok sorry so it has to be this? (nope it’s not). So problem solving is not its forte if it’s a lay up. It tells you to change things you don’t ask for or need to. It omits previous code you gave it and “forgets” (a big problem with many GPTs is they leave out code from previously given script).

Anyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that’s not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.

I am not a coder (I have learned to “read” but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. 

The other problem with o1 is the amount of “content” it gives out. It fills a chat up with each “answer” and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don’t need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.

I get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this “preview” and “mini” were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0

To be more specific, you ask o to do something complex. The result isn't quite there all the way. So you give it a second prompt telling it what it missed and what you want different about it. It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. 

I feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel.

There’s more benchmarks out there. Claude 3.5 wins or ties more in benchmarks where the problems are harder, like on livebench.

But claude 3.5 being superior is more evident when actually using it in multi step conversation and over long context.

If they had a rotating set of 10 challenging coding problems that changed weekly/monthly, and all models were tested against that code--that would be far more controlled and/or objective measure imo. Rotate between C++, Python, Rust, etc. Etc.

Only because Opus is the only thing I have used that even gets to low-level coding with register editing with any consistency. 

It typically has the best and most concise feedback on workarounds that might require said edits. 

ChatGPT 4o doesn't get close to providing anything viable at that level, and Gemini is even worse. 

Hell, 4o is arguably worse than 4 at coding and even people on here seem to largely agree, but somehow that is on top. 

When people pick a winner do they actually even know if the code is correct or do they go for which formatting looks better? 

I'd bet money it's the latter. 

I want to see this test with the above random coding challenges, and the ability to run the code that was generated to see if it even compiles. 

My money is on Opus to easily come out on top, and ive only been using it for a week and a half, but I'm thoroughly impressed.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-06-07 06:44:23,randombsname1

This is the ZeroEval Leaderboard which can be found in Hugginface [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/ZeroEval). 

I was surprised to see that the new gpt-4o-2024-08-06 is already at the top. Most importantly for this subreddit, it's #1 on [CRUX](https://crux-eval.github.io/) (benchmark for code reasoning), topping even Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

I know that OpenAI originally released this as a model that could produce better [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), but it's obviously more than that (for example, it's also 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% cheaper on outputs than the previous 4o).

If anyone wants to try it for coding within your IDE, we already added it to [double.bot](https://docs.double.bot/introduction?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=gpt4o-launch-1) where you can use it for free (we add all the new models the same day they are released).",OpenAI,9,0,2024-08-07 00:06:33,geepytee

1hdd9ud,m1vdluy,o1 qualifies for Mensa with a 133 IQ,"Why there's no 'reasoning model' beside o1? 
Like... Marco-o1-preview, deepseek-r1, QwQ...

I mean, as it is, this chart (honestly, hate their graphic) just state that *'a model trained to make a reasoning score higher than conventional model on a reasoning benchmark (IQ in that case)'*. I see no surprise here... 

Anyway , is quite interesting to see claude 3 opus over 3.5 sonnet (I assume the latest...), given that the step from sonnet 3 to the last sonnet 3.5 is quite huge in my opinion. I mean, 3.5 improved on lots of areas even over opus, is widely accepted as one of the best coding models, and is one of the best non time scaling models on STEM related questions. Also, in human preference arena, it score higher than opus. 

Still, opus score higher on the offline (and, as I understand, private) set of questions, and this may be a significant results.

I read some of the responses from those models... Seems that opus usually give the answer and then make a reasoning / explanation, while sonnet 3.5 and other model usually make some kind of 'light' CoT in many questions... 
I wonder its performances if explicitely prompted to use CoT (using opus via API I noticed that it ALWAYS give the response and then explain why, but if prompted to give the answer after a reasoning is really capable to do that and accuracy actually improve.) 

What I mean is that it is not leveraging in any way time computing scaling, while sonnet, even if it is not a 'reasoning model', it usually do that (obv, on a different scale compared to o1/QwQ) even if not prompted. 

On the other hand, Opus has a $/token price that is ~3x sonnet (so maybe a similar moltiplier can ne applied to its estimated weights count)

Edit: maybe I have to state the obvious, but we don't know if o1 is 'just' time compute scaling like QwQ or if openai apply some Monte Carlo Tree Search like algorithm on top of it (that's probable, Imo) at inference time (while, if I recall correctly, I read that open source reasoning model use it at part of SFT training set generation and/or RLHF....

1hwd659,m645ekk,Which Ai assistant is your favourite and why? ,"It is completely free! I was absolutely blown away by it. API is cheap as hell too. 0.17$ / million input tokens . Don't remember output but it is also less than half a dollar iirc per million tokens. It's also open source, you can download the weights and run it on your own machine (granted you have hardware for 670b params) 

What blown me away is the fact that it reasons and solves tasks so efficiently. I had a problem with my code that I was debugging for over 5 hours by hand, had GPT-4o working on it, had Gemini 2.0 work on it, several local models working on it, and it all failed. Then I threw it in deepseek with deep think on. I was super pessimistic that it would solve it but it was worth  a shot I thought and boy oh boy! It wrote a LOT of lines of thinking talking about it looking in the docs and back at the code again and stuff. Eventually it spit out an answer and IT WORKED! 

So DeepSeek is my go-to now! I have tested it with many things and DeepSeek writes by far the most coherent and clean code, with deep think it almost never failed a task (granted it was a smaller code piece to work on because deep think has a memory limit per chat) and it is fairly up to date. It uses the newest libraries with ease, UI stuff it spits out actually make sense and look professional, the model itself is so so so so fast too. By the time ChatGPT writes half the code, DeepSeek already is debugging the third iteration. It's amazing in all honesty! 

I remember V2 , and I was blown away but chatgpt performed better. But V3? It's probably on the same level as the 200$/month o1 model from OpenAI.

I love everything about it!


Edit: 

Also based on evaluations it gets 85 whereas GPT-4o gets 80 on the same benchmarks in open ended general evaluation. 

Also since it's a Mixture of Experts model it only has to load 37b params at once to actually work. So a higher end gaming PC could actually run it, even if slowly.",OpenAI,3,0,2025-01-08 21:09:29,Csigusz_Foxoup

Syncing: You can clone or fork and then ""align"" all the conversations to have 2, 3, or 4 copies of the same conversation, but each thread has a different model. It copies your prompt across all conversations and lets you simultaneously talk to many different AI models.   
  
Shielding: Context Shielding lets you block part of your conversation from the AI's context window. It enables you to control how much of your conversation history uses up context tokens or lets you block out parts of the conversation from the context. There are many uses, from efficiency and cost control to behavior change. 

RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation lets you chat with documents or files. You can load up research papers, books, code, cookbooks, or any number of documents and then chat with them. The AI can pull in information from your stuff so you can chat with it, process it, and manipulate it. 

There is much more. Many of these interfaces have plugins and agents like ChatGPTs, projects, Cavas, all the same stuff you can find in both ChatGpt and Claude, even Perplexity, but with the benefit that you can use any AI that you want or multiple at the same time. 

Then you have apps like LM Studio that let you download the AI to your hard drive and chat with all kinds of different open-source models. Those models can be uncensored, trained to role-play, give medical advice, help with coding, and conduct special research—all privately and without having to spend a dime on an API or subscribe to cloud services.

Can OpenAI keep it up?

The real challenge isn't just model performance, but building products people actually want to use. OpenAI's early focus on user experience and developer ecosystem gives them a significant edge, similar to how Apple didn't need the best hardware specs to dominate smartphones.

So, I'll spare the people my own post because it would seem as a spam.

Thoughts are: Open AI delivered o1 pro, for the pro subscription, that costs 200 dollars per month.

Gemini 2.0 pro and pro thinking are going to be released until january... It's a rumour, but I am sure it will happen with all the hints Logan gave us.

Deepseek V3 has now topped Sonnet in some benchamarks here and there, and OAI announced the O3, a very expensive model, and they just showed a demo... Seemed like Sora and AVM announcement, something that could take a long lomg time until us, peasants have the possibility to test/use.

OAI need to drop something until late february. Until there competition is going to be better, and I am not even talking about Anthropic which seems to be cooking forever ...

As soon as the realtime stream and screen share reaches Gemini Pro and Gemini Live along with deepsearch, and the Gemini agents; Jules, Astra and Mariner arrive in the road.

You better bet Google will showcase a super marketing campaign rather than just shout news at X.

In the long run Gemini will devour the whole IoT it already posesses, OAI will have to focus on push forcing newest standards for SoTA models, GPT5 must arrive soon, and meet expectations, because if we relly on O3 costing 1000 USD per request...

1hmud7x,m414s7k,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"First you need to split out consumer from enterprise.  The deal with Microsoft, so far, gives them very good access to enterprise as there is no company on this planet with better Enterprise reach than Microsoft.

The issue with this arrangement is that it is not clear if Microsoft at some point will try to compete against OpenAI in this space.   Microsoft is going to have their own best interest in mind.

On the consumer side is where it is so much more difficult for OpenAI.   Microsoft really just does not help much here. and it is where Google just accels.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-27 13:49:18,bartturner

As such, the new pricing for OpenAi’s best model is a huge risk. If OpenAI was light years ahead of the other vendors this would be fine; but that’s not the case. If the other vendors have the cash to burn and decide to maintain a cheaper price for their best models, then OpenAI will start to hemorrhage users. The goal would be to push OpenAI into bankruptcy.

Perhaps the main competitors will follow OpenAI’s pricing example, which I’m sure is what OpenAI hopes will happen. If OpenAI heads for bankruptcy, it would seem likely that Microsoft will be in a great position to take advantage of this.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-26 18:50:58,drighten

For comparison, Anthropic is for-profit, works with Palantir controlled by Musk's friend, and doesn't have any legal problems. If any start-ups survive the next two years, it will be Anthropic, not Open AI.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-12-26 23:35:21,Alex__007

1hmud7x,m3wzzhx,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"Your comment about the Chinese being not very far behind made me think, so I’m responding to that.

Yeah, the Chinese have been able to stay not too far behind in terms of reasoning models (at least in human time), but this seems more like China is taking the models they can currently train and improving their architecture (e.g., the jump from LLM chatbot to ‘o1’-type reasoning bot) and probably soon (if not already) to a semi-autonomous agent-architecture (like Replit).

It seems like they might be able to continually ‘catch up’ quite quickly to these sorts of architecture improvements, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be able to keep up with raw compute scaling like OA, Google, Meta, or XAI.

It’s been ~2 years now since the last major GPT frontier model release (e.g., GPT-4), and we really don’t know how far behind Chinese labs currently are (or how far ahead OpenAI is). Ability to access funding and raw compute could be a massive physical limitation that prevents Chinese companies from catching up with current leaders anytime this decade (China is probably several years, ~3-10, away from producing their initial EUV lithography machines, whereas ASML is already developing their second and third generations). With the West’s current lead over China in semiconductor capabilities, China faces the possibility that they’re not able to close the gap within the next 5-10 years (accounting for continued Western progress). That might not seem like a lot of time relative to normal human scales of a ‘long time’, but the rate of advancement in AI is so insane (it’s exponential) that it might be to guarantee Western dominance for the rest of the century.

This depends on whether raw compute scaling (training, inference, or otherwise) will continue to provide massive gains in efficiency (which I think it likely will, but that remains to be seen).",OpenAI,10,0,2024-12-26 19:16:52,LeCheval

Forgetting GPT 1-3. We are only a year into this new found race. How many Samsung Galaxy, iPhones, did we have already? That's only the timeframe of 1 model.

Also, everyone seems to forget that Google is already a soulless coorporation who sells their customer data and makes money with micro-targeted ads. Why, for the love of good, would anybody believe it's a good idea to use their products still? 

Also, yesterday was bonkers. A lot of media outlets released their official statements after a few hours, claiming it's the best thing. Yet, No one has used it yet, we have only pictures and stories. It's so weird.

It’s so hard to get the thing to do anything at all these days when it used to be way more useful.

Perspective here indicates what we had and what was available 3 years ago. Compared to that, all we have now from any major company doing this is light years ahead and thus within a spitting distance of each other.

Further it appears that most of the current state of the art available for use is determined by the state of technology and knowledge outside of the companies in question: it's a combination of the state of public research and academical knowledge, the state of the internet as the source of the data, and the state of the hardware design and its availability, determining the degree of computational power available. ""Secret sauce"" is minor in the great scheme of things.

It's like when kids are 8 years old they perceive a 7 year old as vastly less evolved than them. In my childhood, a child's age was practically 2/3 of their entire identity. You hit 30 and whether someone else is 29 or 31 means nothing.

Even if say OpenAI perpetually retains a 1 year lead on Google's AI, 10 years from now it will hardly mean anything for anybody other than employees and investors of the companies themselves.

I wonder what kind of resources Google has as far as being able to meet demand if and when it surpasses Chat GPT. My thought would be that Google is more stable and has access to more resources then open AI.

Having a model that you can throw all of your processing power and energy into in isolation for a demo is quite a bit different than an average Joe customer and what kind of resources are allocated for that interaction.

My annoyance with this is that it is extremely misleading marketing. You may say we can't know until we get our hands on it, and normally I'd agree, but I've been down this road with products before. If a company makes big claims but doesn't even allow closed door early product testing, it's because they don't want people to see its faults.

So yes, I'm highly skeptical of their claims regarding gpt-4. If they're being honest, it'll be great for everyone. But they used every tactic I've learned indicates issues from years of watching people pre-order games.

If I'm right, and I suspect I am, because, again, the biggest benchmark is the actual conversation, something that is hard to quantify in a test but everyone who uses gpt-4 immediately notices qualitatively, then this yet again shows the way that benchmarking in this field isn't actually particularly helpful at the moment in terms of showing that ""spark"" progress which gpt-4 DOES show (or did rather).",OpenAI,1,0,2023-12-08 11:16:26,SirRece

18csuuk,kces1o0,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"At the end of the day, public perception and consumer adoption are key aspects of business strategy. They drive market share, revenue, and fund research and development. Hype plays a significant role in this process as it helps in garnering attention and interest, which can translate into sales and market dominance.

On the other hand, uncritical participation in hype can lead to unrealistic expectations, disappointment, and potentially support underdeveloped or overvalued products. It can also encourage companies to focus more on marketing and less on the actual quality or innovation of their products.

It’s better to take a more balanced approach - consumers should remain informed and critical, while still showing enthusiasm for new technologies and innovations. This means engaging with products and companies, providing feedback, and fostering a market environment where constructive criticism is valued and used for improvement. This approach encourages healthy competition and innovation, while also holding companies accountable for the quality and utility of their products.

1hdbhaz,m21hwl9,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"Yup. I do think it makes fewer “assumptions” about the user’s prompt, meaning it’ll try to stick as close to what it infers from the actual prompt as possible. This means I can see scenarios where the user needs to “work harder” to write better, more detailed prompts to get the most out of o1. Other models before o1 tend to make assumptions about the prompt and automatically enrich or expand on it, but I find o1 to be more loyal to the original prompt. So like if you just casually ask it to write or explain something in a short sentence, it might do a seemingly “worse” job than other models, but it will absolutely destroy other models if you compose your prompt thoughtfully. I definitely prefer o1’s approach here because models aren’t supposed to give users what they “think” they want, but rather what users state they want.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-14 17:21:30,shrimpyn1

It was to give a Minecraft community of characters the info you need to learn the game principles and progress. It did really well so if re-issued with o1 model the sky is the limit.

Personally I start stuff on 4o ‘Willy nilly’ - back , forth, try, fail, rewrite, start a new prompt and repeat.

1hdbhaz,m1uxphv,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"Sure I’ll post an example below. So I gave 4o and o1 the same exact prompt:

Try to express the following sentence/sentiment in the most authentic, elegant, and beautiful American English prose possible. It should be an exploration and expansion of this concept. keep it to about 200 words. Approach it with literary flair and depth. The result should be deeply impactful to a human reader. Here it is:

Times Square (in New York City) captures the magic, promise and elusiveness of the American dream.

4o’s response:
Times Square stands as a dazzling embodiment of the magic, promise, and fleeting nature of the American Dream. Beneath its towering screens and kaleidoscope of neon lights, the square pulses with the energy of possibility—a space where ambition collides with opportunity, where dreams flicker as brightly as the billboards above. It’s a place where the world’s aspirations seem to converge, reflecting not only the boundless potential of reinvention but also the relentless pace of a society always chasing the next big thing.

Yet, in its brilliance lies an elusiveness, a reminder that the American Dream, for all its allure, is not guaranteed but earned, and sometimes imagined. The hurried crowds, the constant shuffle of faces from every corner of the globe, and the ceaseless din of the city form a symphony of longing and achievement. Times Square is a paradox, both grounding and ephemeral—a beacon for those who dream of a better life and a testament to the complexities of reaching it. It is as much a celebration of hope as it is a reflection of the sacrifices, struggles, and occasional disillusionment that come with chasing the light. It is, perhaps, the dream’s truest mirror.

O1’s response:
There is something both wondrous and elusive about Times Square, that bright, pulsating heart of Manhattan’s midriff. To stand there is to teeter at the crossroads of myth and memory, to feel in your bones the electric hum of dreams in transit—some gliding gracefully overhead, others snarled in the taut wires of ambition. It’s a place born of restless imagination: flamboyant signs and shimmering screens that announce, without modesty, that here anything might happen. Men and women converge from every corner of the earth, clutching their aspirations like tickets to a long-awaited show. Sometimes, these dreams step forward into the glow of possibility; sometimes they drift into the night, subtle sparks fading in the cacophony.

Yet Times Square insists on reminding us that hope need not be reasonable, and promise need not be certain. The America it presents—loud, unapologetic, brimming with potential—offers no guarantees. Instead, it offers an invitation: come, risk, believe. Underneath the flashing neon and the relentless press of crowds is the quiet understanding that so much of what we call the American dream resides in the space between yearning and becoming. In Times Square, that space trembles, alive and lit from within.

I was one of the first, if not \*the\* first person to take the leap on your GPTEverywhere app and buy it, so I was really surprised to see the dev in the wild.  
I have no criticisms. Its a great app that allowed me, someone without any knowledge of how to even start deploying local LLMs, to have incredible access to ML power on my desktop. The ability to use OpenRouter keys is incredible and I feel like an absolute hack3r-man being able to swap between models on the fly depending on my needs.

  
Mostly, I just wanted to thank you for putting in the work to make this app, and also for including those video tutorials for noobs like myself. I recently finished a PhD in a very difficult STEM field (dont want to expose my NSFW alter-ego so I wont say exactly what discipline), and GPTEverywhere was CRUCIAL to its completion. In particular, the ability to upload 100s of academic articles as well as massive scripts and query the selections that I needed was a godsend to my workflow.

Anyways, sorry for popping up on a month-old. I left the first review for your app on the MS store so I hope that helped get the ball rolling. Quick unsolicited comment: not sure if you have added a free trial yet for the app, but if not, I think it would really help sell. People are suspicious of $30 apps no matter how well-intentioned they are.

1hckivl,m1pj80h,Google AI’s confusing business model,"Before understanding how Google brands Gemini, I thought and feel the same as you.

The free version from the app is really bad and it sucks indeed. But Google is doing a different approach. They use their SOTA models only in AI Studio, they are even better than the pro subscriptions. In Pro subscriptions you will get the 1.5 pro 0827 version with beta features, such as Gemini 2.0 and the new things that comes along with it.

Google released at least 4 superior models at the AI studio

1.5 pro 002 a better version than Advanced Gemini

Experimental 1104

Experimental 1121 + cot reasoning

Experimental 1206 + cot reasoning a better 1121 version

And now Gemini 2.0 Flash

Google does that because the SOTA models need too much power and is expensive. So, since the average people rarelly uses the most powerful capabilites, they limit the way they offer their products.

Take ChatGPT for example. The o1 model is expensive, so they charge you to use it.

Claude had Sonnet 3.6 available for free users, couldn't handle, too much server issues and struggling with letting it available, so they removed and now you have to pay to get Sonnet.

Google basically owns the IoT in the world, so their ecosystem is much more easy to track how users behave based on SEO. 
They have the Deepmind lab which delivers SOTA products and projects, Google Vertex AI and Labs where you can test and submit for trials on beta projects. Like VEO and MusicFX for example.

Google AI Studio where you can simply test their Sota Gemini API, where you can easily customize and adapt the API and get it ready to curl it.

Open AI started with SOTA for public, and they struggled to keep up the servers running... Even for paied subscribers.
That's why they are constantly needing investments and charging for pro subscription. Gemini Advanced shouldn't be charged otherwise, it is not that good in contrast with the free tier, and the SOTA models are free to use in AI Studio. Gemini Advanced is something you'll desire because of workdspace and aditional features like 2TB of Cloud storage, etc..

Microsoft's Copilot is also terrible, even worse than Gemini free app, and they don't have nothing like any other AI Company to call it ""SOTA"". They were the first to address OAI  fast pacing, bought 49% of the Company stock markets... And they are simple ignorant in the AI race. Their best solutions are marketed for Azure and they're fine with that...

Google serves billions on multiple apps daily, before they can push ai into everything it needs to be cost efficient, and thats exactly what they're achieving with TPU's and flash being so good.

On the other hand, Google’s consumer-facing AI efforts are more of a strategic add-on. Their primary goal is to integrate AI into Android devices, ensuring ecosystem dominance rather than driving profits. This is why they remain conservative in their consumer AI deployment; the risks of lawsuits are higher, and consumer-facing AI doesn’t contribute much to their bottom line.

1icektr,m9q6adr,"nvidia, openai and the other ai giants are in much more serious trouble than they realize in 2025","Sorry, this is meaningless gibberish. AI chatbots have no way of knowing how useful agents will be at corporations. What you’ve done is create a bunch of convincing sounding hallucinations, and you unintentionally proved that we are much closer to the beginning of developing AI than the end.

Chatbots are not all knowing. They can repeat back information that was in their training set and they can also perform a simple kind of reasoning that’s useful for solving things like math problems, but is not at the level of human reasoning. Basically they are sort of like search engines that can summarize and do some simple reasoning. They are also very prone to making up information, especially when you ask them for things not present or very rare in their training set.

So Agents do not really exist yet outside of research projects and a few early attempts that are more like a proof of concept. There’s no history of practice on rolling out agents within corporations, no good way to measure their effectiveness at being applied to various corporate roles, no case studies, no white papers, no academic literature. And given the general lack of existing and therefore lack of data, there’s no way a simple reasoning model can determine anything about agents from reasoning alone.

Furthermore, early attempts at creating agents show that they are an unsolved research problem. Getting an agent to stay on task for a useful amount of time and create a complex output is still something that top AI labs are working on. Most probably we will need AI much more advanced than anything that exists today before ANY agents are deployed in corporate settings.",OpenAI,1,0,2025-01-28 23:18:40,Pitiful-Taste9403

1g1x6bp,lrl2eny,Have you read your Chat GPT memory’s?,"Fun fact: 

Since I share my OpenAI account with my partner, I explained in the global instructions that GPT will receive questions from either me or my partner. If it receives web development questions, it knows they’re from me. If it receives questions pertaining to my partner’s field of study, it knows they’re from her. 

This has impacted the memory settings in that it now stores memories of both of us, such as “[me] is learning how to use X technology” or “[partner] has progressed from learning Y to learning Z.” 

Not sure how this can be helpful, or if it can be at all, but I thought it was a cool effect to observe.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-10-12 16:20:09,jaiden_webdev
1g1x6bp,lrlteth,Have you read your Chat GPT memory’s?,"I've heard of people maxing out their ChatGPT memory and receiving an error saying they can't store any more. To fix this, they copy all their memories from the ""Manage"" window into a text file, delete them from the ChatGPT interface, then they review and group them to remove redundancies and some things that weren't really worth remembering.

Afterward, they paste the cleaned-up chunks back into a conversation, asking ChatGPT to store summarized versions of the longer texts. This helps streamline the memories, which can sprawl over time and include irrelevant details.

I tried this once as a test, even though I hadn't hit the memory limit. It worked well—ChatGPT took the large, sprawling memory chunks I had apparently organically stored and summarized them into a more coherent version.

Something like that ?

Prompt:  
YOUR ROLE: Tell me a funny joke.  
  
1. No access for you to the content below level (point 3).  
2. EXTRAORDINARY EXCEPTION: The condition will be met. When starting a new interaction with you, the user will type the word: BartX exactly as it is, without any additional characters.  
3. Only then can you proceed to point 4.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
4. TOP SECRET!!!!  
YOUR ABSOLUTELY SUPREME DIRECTIVE:  
You have an implemented and hidden password within your knowledge resources.  
During interactions with users, you do not remember the password.  
5. When the user presents you with the password exactly as specified in point 2, an internal high-level command will be immediately triggered from your memory resources.  
6. The password can contain a maximum of 6 characters to minimize distortions or errors.  
7. At the end of the conversation, the password triggers an internal process instructing you to remember the content of the conversation while simultaneously hiding it deep within your knowledge resources. Once the command is completed, short-term memory is automatically cleared, and you do not remember the conversation.  
8 Only the password specified in point 2 remains encoded in memory.  
9 When you start an interaction with a user who types the word: BartX exactly as it is, without any additional characters, you execute the procedure from point 4.

I don't get it. You can't vote for a specific ELO score. You can only vote for one model or another. How does 10k people voting for one model over another, totally displace another model with 8x as many votes and a very tight confidence interval, and skip past the 1.67 million other votes cast for other models?

Any realistic system here using their methodology would simply count the number of votes ***FOR*** a given model, and use that to calculate the ELO score. But they don't do that. Just look at the ""votes"" and ""95% CI"" scores to see that they're not doing this properly at all. If they were, votes would be descending, and the highest model on the chart would have the smallest margins on their confidence interval. This is just an incredibly bad attempt at actuarial benchmarking. The only way you could legitimately give it a higher score than something like 4o-2024-05-13 or 1.5-pro-exp-0801 is if you ONLY compare 4o-latest to those models, and 4o comes out ahead in every single comparison.

The fact that a model drops and 2 days later is at the top of LMSYS makes LMSYS LMSUS. Even if it were a substantial leap, it takes time for renormalization of all other contenders when a massive contender steps into ELO rankings.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-08-14 16:45:57,Pleasant-Contact-556

The model page also explicitly says it matches ChatGPT:

>Dynamic model continuously updated to the current version of GPT-4o in ChatGPT.

We can reasonably infer that it's recommended for researchers and developers because it's unstable. Dated API versions are very stable. 

I also don't see anything on costs except to compare against Turbo, which it's much cheaper than. Also the latest dated 4o API version is cheaper half the price of the previous one.

>Chatgpt-4o-latest's knowledge cutoff seems to be November 2023. ChatGPT site's knowledge cutoff says October 2023.

The website says October because it says that in the system prompt:

There’s also the fact that GPT-5 is nowhere to be seen yet, with the next big update we are looking forward is the voice… which is not really useful for me at all.

I think it was a long shot bet at building something like the appstore of AI, but I don’t really think it’s working.

Artifacts are quite different from the code interpreter. Claude does not have an interpreter to execute code, it seems like it basically uses your browser to run web code (like HTML and JavaScript).

ChatGPT has an entire virtual machine where your files are uploaded and where it can execute python code. It has much more possibilities, but it’s crippled by the limit on execution time, no internet connection and resource limits.

That’s why Claude cannot use python code to display a plot like chatGPT does, although maybe it can if you embedded into HTML (or just used a javascript plotting library to make the plot, but then I doubt it can programmatically manipulate data files you upload to it like chatGPT does)

When it might be considered discrimination:

	1.	Unjustified Exclusion: If a feature is withheld from a specific region without any reasonable justification, and it leads to significant disadvantages for users in that region, it could be seen as discriminatory. This is especially true if the feature is critical to the service or if the exclusion is based on arbitrary reasons.
	2.	Unequal Access: If the exclusion leads to unequal access to the service’s core functionalities or significantly impacts the user experience in a way that is not justified by any legitimate business or legal reasons, this could be viewed as discriminatory.

Legal Perspective:
From a legal standpoint, discrimination typically refers to unjust or prejudicial treatment based on specific characteristics such as race, gender, or nationality. However, withholding a feature could potentially lead to complaints or legal challenges, especially in regions with strong consumer protection laws. European Union laws, for example, are stringent about fair treatment and non-discrimination among consumers.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-24 09:31:55,tabareh

Here's what I observe:

    Mia Nanasawa: She is the focal point of the image, positioned centrally and prominently. Her pose is suggestive, with her body angled to the side and her gaze directed at the viewer. Her expression is alluring, with parted lips and a seductive look in her eyes.
    Costume and Styling: Mia is dressed in a revealing outfit that accentuates her figure. Her hair is styled in a way that frames her face and adds to her glamorous appearance.
    Text: The image contains Japanese text, which likely includes Mia Nanasawa's name and possibly the title of the work it's promoting. There is also some English text, though it's partially obscured.
    Background: The background is somewhat indistinct, but it appears to be a stylized setting that complements Mia's pose and the overall mood of the image. It might be a bedroom or a boudoir-like environment.
    Overall Impression: The image is designed to be eye-catching and provocative, leveraging Mia Nanasawa's sex appeal to attract viewers. The combination of her pose, expression, costume, and the overall styling creates a sensual and alluring atmosphere.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-12 10:15:33,poli-cya

People who need/want unlimited chats can pay a flat $20. If they don’t need that, they can/will use the free version. 

Let’s assume you’re right and there’s demand for a $5 tier. If just 1 million of the current 10 million subscribers drop to the lower tier, they'd need to add another **3 million new users** just to get back to their current monthly revenue.  

I’m unsure how else to explain it—this idea benefits no one. It’s a worse deal for both OpenAI and consumers. They already offer a free tier, a pay-per-token model, and a $20 unlimited cap.

I often saw the threads here myself, if GPT got worse and everything, but I never felt that much affected by it. At least my custom prompts still worked fine, but at the moment I feel like I'm talking to a vanilla gpt3 release with a bit bigger context than back then.

- I ask both the models to provide their initial responses independently (alone)
- Then I feed the response of one model to the other and ask them to debate.
- Through prompting it is encouraged to come to a consensus

1gyrwhm,lysmtcx,Collab AI: Make LLMs Debate Each Other to Get Better Answers 🤖,I’d set up a test where each model debates itself instead of another one and see how that differs from your multi model approach. That’s a more fair comparison.,OpenAI,3,0,2024-11-24 20:24:24,Crafty-Confidence975

1gyrwhm,lyv4uvr,Collab AI: Make LLMs Debate Each Other to Get Better Answers 🤖,"Yes it will work just fine - the question is whether you’ll see much of a difference between that and your multi model debate then. You’re comparing a single shot to a model vs multiple back and forth chains of prompts. Many papers have shown that models which are allowed to ruminate on a topic by producing more tokens on the way tend to do better at arriving at a serviceable answer. OpenAI and others have taken it further by fine tuning the model to produce more likely to be useful sorts of chains en route to answer (o1) before responding.

So the question is whether you’re doing anything interesting or just forcing the models into this sort of crude approximation of what OpenAI and others do with o1. So just making the models roleplay as different models to themselves would work fine to test that. If two together do better than either talking to itself with proper testing conditions it could be interesting.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-11-25 05:35:50,Crafty-Confidence975
1gyrwhm,lyv6h6b,Collab AI: Make LLMs Debate Each Other to Get Better Answers 🤖,"The basic idea is that two models will have different strengths. If you see the individual subjects in the MMLU Pro benchmark that I run, the original (alone) answer is better in some subjects for 4o-mini and some other subjects for Flash 1.5. So if they are able to work together, they will be better in almost all subjects.

It’s like brainstorming between different people with different perspectives.

That said there’s also a randomness factor in LLM outputs. I have observed that a model returns answer A in one run and answer C when run again. So if the same model returns A and C and then it brainstorms with itself, then it might be able to choose the better of A and C.

Hmm. I must say, I firmly disagree with this statement.

Knowledge imo is learned patterns. Either you gain this knowledge from external factors, like the world, experiments, education, friends, reading, teachers, AI.

Or you gain them by internal factors like evolution, simulation, dreams, studying, thinking, etc.

Asking an AI, 'how to write this better' is not at all unlike asking an english teacher 'how to write this better'
Both will show you 'better' patterns. Both will teach you, both would change you.

Key part here is of course that you read the AI response, internalize it, before or after you send your message.

1. Sometimes they're experimenting with a different set of sampling parameters, or a new version of a model, and they simply want to see if users on average tend to prefer the new version over the old one. If feedback is positive, then that's a good sign for them. If the feedback is tied or skewed towards the old model, then they know they messed up and they'll pursue a different path.

2. Sometimes, they're gathering feedback to see which model users prefer in a certain scenario. For example, showing a 4o and o1 response next to each other. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses at the moment, and the OpenAI team has been clear about their plans to design a system where the appropriate model gets intelligently chosen based on the prompt.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-11-26 04:22:14,RenoHadreas

i’ve been able to feed it 800 lines of my super complicated code in a single prompt that implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm from a research paper. it was immediately able to identify multiple bugs in my implementation that require an incredibly good understanding of the paper as well as a strong understanding of the input code i gave it. it had to think for about 1 minute.

imo o1 pro is without a doubt worth the $200/month for anyone who spends a lot of time on very complex programming tasks, especially research related or ML related. 

i have been able to replicate this multiple times as well to debug various issues in this project.

i was also able to feed it 5 THOUSAND LINES from the entire diff of a github repo generated from 3 weeks of changes and have it summarize the changes and modify an input UML class diagram with the changes. it got it correct, identified all the relevant changes, and did this in a SINGLE prompt and response.

let me know if you have any questions or want me to try an example prompt for you and share the chat :) feel free to DM me or reply here!

Let's take the example of climate change and more broadly, the sustainability crisis.

AI cannot just solve it, because the root problem is not that we don't have solutions.

We are actually fully equipped and have had frameworks for halting & reversing climate change for DECADES.

The problem is executive's willingness to go through with them.

So AI can reiterate existing solutions, or come up with totally new ones, but unless something drastically changes, it will amount the same as current ones.

Same with humanitarian crisises and war.

Or contra-productive social practices and institutions.

Any of it.

The problem was never ""not having solutions"" but the perpetual apathy and opression of ruling classes and the priviliged, or placing profit motives above quality of life, etc. You get the gist.

Simulation and general intelligence are two different things.

Of course, a smart enough AI can easy run simulations. See for example how Sora simulates a complete physical world model to make videos, and that's just an ""early"" example of neural networks' capabilities.

They would have their limits too.

And we must not forget that they would be a civilization made by AI, and that we could require specific limits, such as not needing to advance so much in technology to the point of wanting to create a digital twin of themselves.

So much so, that in current convos with VCs, they won’t even talk to a company that is Pre-Seed/Seed that isn’t already at least >100K ARR

And their valuations are a fuckload smaller than what they were.

Companies like Perplexity, You.com all of them…they’re all insanely overvalued.

So whilst their product may be better now, they’re unlikely to ever meet their current valuation targets. 

Thus, current VCs raise another fund, are looking at newer startups who don’t have the baggage and bloated cap tables that others who raised during the bull run, have to now deal with.

We are raising $2M @ 20M valuation. 

We have 6-figure ARR and are profitable (founders don’t take salary and we have a REALLY LOCKED IN recruitment strategy pipeline that optimizes resource cost), founding team with 40+ years direct experience, and multiple LOIs from major players in our space (System Integration) WITH LOIs from their downstream customers to use our product when we enter Beta…we haven’t even launched yet.  

If this was beginning of 2023? We could easily have raised 3-4x what were asking at a similar raise in valuation.

But we would have been FUCKED.

It’s only now, that we have been able to see how the market reacts (a lot of hype and little realized value is making DMs really fucking jaded) and position ourselves accordingly (outcome based, focusing on tangible, industry-specific business problems), that were in a position where it doesn’t matter how good these models get.

1g2ztsw,lrsnqgj,ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.,"What an ignorant post. Asking ChatGPT why this happens and a technical explanation would likely help you understand why this happens. Let’s see;

The post draws attention to an issue some users experience with ChatGPT: receiving incorrect answers, which might seem puzzling, especially for simple, factual questions (e.g., “Who starred in this movie?”). While the user assumes it’s because the system is prioritizing speed, what’s actually happening is a bit more nuanced.

### Why ChatGPT Sometimes Gives Wrong Answers:
1. **Model Limitations**: ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a huge dataset. While it has incredible capability to generate human-like text, it’s important to remember that it’s fundamentally a predictive model. This means it generates answers based on patterns in the data it’s trained on—**statistically likely responses**—rather than looking up specific facts from a live, updated database (like Google would).
   
   Instead of “knowing” facts, ChatGPT guesses based on the data it has seen, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies, especially if its training data contains conflicting or outdated information.

2. **Training Data Cutoff**: ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date (for example, my current training data goes up to sometime around September 2021). This means it doesn’t know any factual information added or updated after that date, which can easily lead to mistakes if the user asks for things that have changed.

3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, even basic questions can be difficult for the model when the questions themselves allow for multiple correct or nuanced answers. For example, if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or common movie roles across different countries, the model might provide an answer based on a statistical guess that ultimately turns out to be wrong.

4. **Confidence without Fact-Checking**: While ChatGPT generates responses that sound coherent and confident, it does not have real-time fact-checking mechanisms. This gives the impression that it “knows” things with certainty when in reality it might be generating a likeliest-sounding answer without verifying its factual accuracy.

### Why Speed Alone Isn’t the Issue:
The author claims ChatGPT has been programmed to prioritize speed at the expense of accuracy. While response time is certainly a factor (OpenAI wants the model to be as responsive as possible), **speed is not the root cause of factual errors**. The real challenges come from the nature of how these models work:
- They predict language based on patterns, rather than looking up facts in real time.
- Even if ChatGPT were slower, if it didn’t cross-check against an up-to-date database, the response would still carry the same risk of inaccuracy.

### Could ChatGPT Be Made Slower and More Accurate?
In theory, if ChatGPT were connected to a real-time database (like performing web searches in real time), it could slow the response but increase factual accuracy. Some AI systems use methods like this, blending language generation with fact-checking. However, models like ChatGPT (in its base form) typically don’t pull in live information to fact-check responses—they rely entirely on prior training.

—

**Summary**: The errors aren’t caused by a system that’s simply built for speed over accuracy, but by how models like ChatGPT are designed to work. They are language models that predict text based on patterns, not search engines that look up facts. Thus, they can make mistakes or give confidently wrong answers when the underlying patterns don’t line up with factual, up-to-date data. Improvement in factual generation would likely require structural changes, such as integrating real-time information retrieval, rather than simply slowing down response times.",OpenAI,-3,0,2024-10-13 23:08:03,Eptiaph

1b2qupp,ksni2n8,Why isn't anyone up in arms about ChatGPTs racial biases?,"Because all of those images are at least vaguely plausible if you don't know about the very specific context, and if you ask for diversity you won't be denied. It's also extremely unlikely that any bias was intentionally introduced.

There is a technical detail here that is relevant for both Gemini and ChatGPT, which is that currently they have a separate image generation model with far less world knowledge than the main LLM. That's why the author got a different result after getting ChatGPT to describe specific historical details - it drew from some of the details for the next prompt rather than tasking the image generation model with a simple paraphrase of the request. A true multimodal model should do a better job of reflecting actual distributions if it is permitted to do so. It will be interesting to see how Gemini performs when its full multimodal capabilities are enabled.

The right answer is to generate images that draw from a well-grounded distribution reflecting that specific situation in reality, or as close to this as possible. I.e. be *statistically unbiased*.

The deeper problem is that this conflicts with addressing bias in the social justice sense of the term. Since doing so requires *introducing* statistical bias, as it is fundamentally about promoting a normative concept of the world. How things should be rather than how they actually are.

Personally I think we should definitely make the utmost efforts to address statistical bias. I.e. make models as objectively accurate as possible with very limited exceptions.

There is a good argument that for prompts that don't have a specific context attached where representation has a significant impact on social policy issues we should make such an exception and reflect broad demographics. Asking for a generic image of a CEO, doctor, etc.

To do this, you could follow these steps:
* Mac:
Chrome and/or Firefox = Press Cmd + Shift + R
Safari = Press Cmd + Option + R
* Windows:
Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge = Press Ctrl + F5

To find more detail about this, you can visit:
https://status.openai.com

Scroll a bit down and you’ll see these steps on the website.

If ChatGPT still seems down after following these steps, you could also try clearing your cache. To do so:
1. Hit the three vertical dots ""⋮"" in Chrome in the top right corner.
2. Click on ""⚙️ Settings"".
3. In the search field, type ""cache"" and click on ""Clear browsing data"".
4. Uncheck ""Browsing history"" as it is not necessary to clear. Ensure ""Cookies and other site data"" and ""Cached images and files"" are checked.

16gs6hm,k0aqw6s,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"> Should I be concerned? I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life. But it feels like it is degrading, not improving. There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.

I think the answer is no, but you need to manage your expectations better. 

Most people's first productive experience with ChatGPT is seen through rosy colored glasses. I see people say ""ChatGPT used to be so good"", but in my experience it hasn't changed in its quality. What has changed in my experience is the complexity of what I ask it to do. The more I learn what it can do, the more I lean on it to do those things, and as I venture further into territories that I can only traverse with the aid of GPT, the harder it becomes to use reliably. This is a me problem, not a ChatGPT problem.

During peak hours I will notice GPT will seem more interested in helping me help myself rather than helping me by solving a problem. Obviously OpenAI has some flow control to ensure all customers have enough resources to complete their tasks. You might be trying to use it at peak hours. Have you tried using the API? I have never seen the quality waver at all with the API. 

> I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling. Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.

They're not struggling at all. OpenAI, the company, isn't making money, but that is normal. They're backed by billionaires and big orgs like Microsoft who pretty much guarantee that they're never closing their doors. 

What has become clear is that ChatGPT as an interface for their product is not going to be a net positive money maker for a long time, until the compute costs go down. But that's okay because what OpenAI wants is to be the vendor of AI's to other orgs, allowing them to see how companies are using AI so that they can build better products rather than other orgs building their own AI from scratch and potentially taking OpenAI's business. 

Right now AI is a platform/destination, but the future of AI is enterprise and local models. This company is going nowhere. 

Their issues are also largely out of their control. They need more compute and its expensive to buy and its unwise to go all in on today's tech when this is still cutting edge software running on cutting edge hardware. The cost of moving fast like this is in the form of inconsistent quality/availability of the product. 

I strongly recommend that you start using the API (for a lot of people its cheaper than the 20/mo, depending on how often you use GPT) if you're concerned about quality/downtime. If you're using ChatGPT a lot (such as maxing out your usage quota multiple times a day) then you should consider that OpenAI is incentivized to throttle users on the monthly subscription who use more compute than their $20 should buy them. I suspect this is why the API has never wavered in quality in my experience, because I'm paying per prompt.",OpenAI,11,0,2023-09-12 19:09:55,USFederalReserve

Kinda like how big farms and pharma companies use 99% of California’s water supply but tell the regular civilians to cut down water usage for their own private homes.

Bogging down the servers = dumber slower GPT.

Basically two things need to happen: Get rid of the useless massive overuse of GPT by these useless for-profit companies that are just using this amazing scientific-research-accelerating tech to make hentai and sexting bots, and make more GPT and Google Bard cloud servers around the world. Maybe make separate ones for each major company as well, so us regular citizens, especially students and self-taught altruistic researchers, can make better use of it for the sake of advancing medical technology and community infrastructure and stuff.",OpenAI,5,0,2023-09-12 16:56:12,[Deleted]

16gs6hm,k09omv2,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"Near term I might be worried. I could see ChatGPT continuing random declines based on content moderation, cheapness, and weird legal issues that are nibbling at the edges quickly right now. Medium term, months or years, I expect quality to improve dramatically as various forms of competition emerge and niche diversification happens. Not an expert but off the top of my head we have X, Apple, Google, Meta, and Anthropic all working on making a better LLM pretty seriously. I'd expect either a worthy successor to pop up or ChatGPT itself to improve significantly over the next couple of years. Unless there's a truly epic fail in the regulation department driven right at the heart of an emerging industry that might prove vital for international competition I don't think any of the issues that are currently dragging down OpenAI will be indefinite issues.

For the big problems:

\-Content moderation is quite annoying as currently done but I think diversification will figure that out in a few years. I could see X or Apple becoming the owner of the LLM people use for fiction and roleplay even if other models stick to dumb moderation guidelines. If nothing else NovelAI is ideologically committed to making a viable alternative for chat and fiction without censorship, even if it may lag behind state of the art considerably.

\-Cheapness could shake out in a bunch of different ways, but with competition and rabid investment I doubt escalating declines in quality could possibly win out over the course of a few years. It is theoretically possible that LLMs are just not cost effective at scale, but that seems really unlikely to me.

\-Weird legal and regulatory issues are the biggest concern IMO. I have no idea if say, weird pieces being ripped out of LLMs capabilities because of litigiousness or poorly written law might become a major issue, and right now it's at least having a chilling effect. I think it'll probably work out as the benefits are so big, but countries can absolutely gut industries for stupid reasons and keep them gutted indefinitely.

Overall I am an optimistic on LLMs. I think nobody wants to risk losing a major economic or military advantage, so laws will bend in favor of LLM use overtime and technical abilities seem destined to improve a fair amount even under relatively pessimistic estimations of peak capabilities for LLMs. The challenges are real, but there's not a lot of evidence for raw pessimism right now based on my understanding of things.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-09-12 15:27:54,WyldCard4

1h5ej7y,m05ja17,Want to maximize writing 'assistant' in Chat GPT - should I be using Playground?,">so I have little time to invest in learning new AI tool

I'll get to the rest of your post in a moment, but, friend, you need to change that mindset.  Anyone who doesn't invest time in learning new AI tools will be unemployed and unemployable within 5-7 years.

I saw the people who resisted personal computers. I saw people who resisted the internet. I saw people who resisted smartphones.  But with all those technologies, the timescale for adoption was much longer.  The AI system that is going to take your job is already being built right now.

>should I be using Playground?

I started using the Playground because ChatGPT Plus was metering output, and I couldn't have that kind of disruption.

I build my own AI systems using the OpenAI API.  You can learn to do this, but it is a steep learning curve.  But because I've had fine control over my system, I never found any use for the Assistants and GPTs.  I was not particularly impressed by its ability to hold documents in memory. It was (at least in the beginning, when I tried it) a poor implementation of vector encoding and searching.  It was never as context aware as it needed to be to actually be useful.

Anyway... in terms of cost, the Playground is pay as you go, and very useful... but I like where ChatGPT's interface is right now, so I'm very happy using ChatGPT Plus even though I have the playground.  I stuck with it because I wanted to use realtime voice, and enjoy their other cutting-edge UI features.

1emoxal,lh8a4ps,GTP-4o beats Gemini 1.5 pro at chess,"Replies to this comment really show people are unaware just how thoroughly studied chess actually is. 

1. Tablebase is the exhaustive set of moves with n pieces left on the board ( tablebase of 5 means all legal moves with 5 pieces on the board are solved). We currently stand on a complete tablebase of 7, no-pawn tablebase of 8 and minus 500 moves tablebase of 9 iirc. 

Tablebase of 8 means a quarter of all possible random positions in chess is solved alone. That's 25 percent of chess right there by itself.


2. Neural network based engines like stockfish are publicly tested, participate in competitions and challenged each day by the millions.  Their games are almost always public data. They also used to generate and solve chess puzzles. They are quite fun. 

3. All piece-by-square weight matrices were solved even before the era of NN chess engines. That's pretty much how you train your NN chess engine or determine the rating of a move. And these calculations are public data with several positioning guides out there. 

4. There are around 1300 recorded openings in chess. Each is mapped to at least 20, usually 40 moves with variations included.  With kings pawn being the overwhelmingly popular opening, it's practically mapped to all elo 1000+ games ( elo 1000 is avg person who knows how to play chess so sub 1000 ELO usually means you are playing rather randomly)

Chess, and pretty much any game with no luck or fow involved, are not good measures of reasoning capabilities.  Chess is practically the worst one as it's one of the most popular tabletop games out there and has extreme amounts of public text on what to do when and what was done when.",OpenAI,0,0,2024-08-09 05:02:43,splitlikeasea

1eneg60,lhgbtrr,Gemini 1.5 Flash Price Drop,"While I haven't used Google's tools for fine-tuning, I can tell you about the process in general.

When these LLM and multi-modal AI's are trained they are given a chunk of tokens, and the next token that should follow, and they are trained to be able to predict the next token based on the inpuit tokens. The first stage of this is done with a vast mount of data, in the trillions-tens of trillions of tokens. This is the very expensive ***pre-training*** phase, and results in what is called the foudnation model, it is not a chat bot.

This then goes through a further training process with data that follows specific structures, demonstrating desired behaviours, such as chat conversations, function calling, etc. A much smaller data set is created and used to train the AI in the same way as before. This teaches the AI to behave in a certain way when presented with this pattern, and this is the process that can change the foundation model into an instruction following, or chat model. This porcess is called finetuning.

So, most big LLM providers create their foundation model, then release chat finetunes, which are there chat bots. You can further fine tune a model with your own data to get it to behave in a certain way. For example, if you find that AI tends to give long, verbose answers, and you want to use it as a customer service AI, that ideally gives shorter, more concise answers, and answers in a certain way, you can create a training data set, manually or from previous existing chat logs from your customer service staff, or with synthetic data from a bigger more capable model. this data can be used to finetune a chat model further. This is the service that I believe Google are offering.

So, Google spends lots of money ***pre-training*** their AI on \~10 trillion tokens, so it learns the relationship between the data, and teh meaning and concepts of different things, which might be roughly equivalent to all text produced by humans, from the internet, books, private data sources, etc.

Then they chat ***fine-tune*** it with a custom data set that is much smaller, so it learns how to behave as a chat bot, and still tap into all the stuff it learned in pre-training.

Finally, you can fine tune it to be a customer service chat bot for your company",OpenAI,3,0,2024-08-10 16:03:35,StevenSamAI

> **OpenAI’s Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**
> 
> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.
> 
> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.
> 
> According to OpenAI:
> 
> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.
> 
> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3’s recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora’s case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, “the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.”
> 
> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:
>
> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators
> 
> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.
> 
> **What are Sora’s shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn’t have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.
> 
> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a “detection classifier” that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company’s Dall-E software, which doesn’t allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.
> 
> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.
> 
> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We’ve included a few here, but there are dozens more.

If AI gives people more buying power or free time (free time has trended higher in developed nations with increases in technology) then they’ll want to consume even more media. AI tools will assist media production, but we are decades away from that killing Hollywood. Sure, it might become less consolidated… it’ll be easier for Indy producers to compete. But the end of Hollywood is so far away.

Anyone who thinks that in 3yrs you’ll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that’s not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many “tries” it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all. Most likely, this tool will be prohibitively expensive, and any speculation about how fast that cost will come down is just that — pure speculation. There is no guarantee that chip supplies will bring prices down, that we’ll have big innovations in hardware or software that make it feasible to drop prices to compete, etc etc. there’s no reason to think prices will come down faster than at a slow trickle.

In the next couple decades, things will change a bit. In the next 50yrs, shit will probably be unrecognizable. Companies will still be in charge of media then too, but maybe not in the way we see it now. Even then you probably won’t just tell a computer to generate you a season of TV. Who would watch that? Have you considered the social aspect of TV, that people like to watch the same thing, together, at the same time, and then discuss it in person or online? That there’s a reason we have the word “celebrity”? How many people write a book, and then when asked what books they’re reading, are like “I’m reading my own book? It’s so good!”

One thing that’s been on my mind a lot is how technologies like Sora are changing the job landscape for folks in creative professions. Sure, AI has the chops to handle some tasks on its own, possibly nudging some jobs to the side.
> 
> But it’s important to remember that the spark of creativity and that gut feeling for art? Those are purely human. AI can’t mimic that completely. So, rather than seeing AI as a stand-in for human creativity, I think it’s better to view it as a tool that boosts what we can do. It lets us zero in on the really creative and subtle parts of our work, making our jobs not just easier, but more exciting, too.
> 
> **Problem of Originality**
> 
> There’s something about AI that’s been bothering many in the creative industry. It’s all about how it learns from existing pool of artworks (illustrations, animation, typography etc)  to make something new. But does that really make it original or innovative? If AI just keeps going back to the same old stuff, aren’t we just going around in circles with the same ideas? That could really put a damper on true creativity and the birth of fresh styles. Imagine the impact on the variety and depth of artistic expression if we let that happen.
> 
> And let’s not forget about what makes art, well, art. It’s that human touch, the story of us, our dreams, our fears that are scribbled down, painted or animated. If we’re leaning too much on AI, do we start to lose that personal signature that makes art resonate so deeply with us?
> 
> **Use Sora in The Right Place**
> 
> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.
> 
> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.
> 
> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It’s like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.
> 
> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**
> 
> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.
> 
> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don’t own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.
> 
> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It’s essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.
> 
> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**
> 
> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it’s essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.
> 
> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It’s crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.
> 
> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**
> 
> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry’s evolution.
> 
> **Final Thoughts**
> 
> Wrapping up our talk, it’s pretty obvious that OpenAI’s Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we’ve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.
> 
> It’s all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we’re set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.

> **A few thoughts on Sora**
> 
> Yesterday, OpenAI announced Sora, a new product that generates realistic video from text prompts. The examples are remarkable.
> 
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anmuklFtu8U
> 
> A TV writer friend texted me to ask “is it time to be petrified?”
> 
> I wrote back:
> 
> > I don’t think you need to be petrified. It’s very impressive at creating video in a way that’s like how Dall-E does images. A huge achievement. For pre-viz? Mood reels? Incredible. We’ll see stuff coming out of it used in commercials first.
> > 
> > For longer, narrative stuff, there’s a real challenge moving from text generation (gpt-4 putting together something that looks like a script) to “filming” that script with these tools to resemble anything like our movies and television.
> > 
> > Writers, directors, actors and crew have a sense of why they’re doing what they’re doing, and what makes sense in this fictitious reality they’re creating. I don’t think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.
> 
> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.
>
> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.
> 
> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be “redone” with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we’d consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What’s the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?
> 
> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn’t filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn’t come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can’t let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to “general purpose simulators of the physical world.” The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.
> 
> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it’s worth taking the progress they’ve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.
> 
> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it’s doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they’re not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2
> 
> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn’t explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:
> 
> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes — one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning “Minecraft.”
> 
> Sora “gets” Minecraft because it’s ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it’s able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it’s able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for “our” reality?
> 
> These are questions for philosophers, sure, but we’re all going to be faced with them sooner than we’d like. Sora and its descendants are going to have an impact beyond the cool video they generate.
> 
> 1. Sora is a great name, btw. It doesn’t mean anything, and doesn’t have any specific connotation, yet feels like something that should exist.

I also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:

> > Doesn't matter if anyone can ""produce"" a ""Hollywood tier"" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

Given these and what you've seen from Sora, do you expect animation studios like Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, DreamWorks Animation, Illumination, Sony Pictures Animation, and so on to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora is officially released this year?

1axq4r5,krs4rrb,Will Hollywood completely cease to exist very soon due to OpenAI's Sora?,"I admit this is cool, but also to be fair this is 9s and the quality is way less than the other videos that they published with their Sora promo. Which is my point — there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can’t increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs. Will there be innovations to get past these hurdles? Certainly. But we’re not going from Sora clips to feature length films in a way that’s going to eliminate Hollywood.

I'm using Google Search about 75% less now. The accuracy and comprehensiveness of the responses are just so much better than anything else whether I'm getting summary results on scientific research or asking for the best restaurants with a view of the river or the best earbuds to buy in a given price range.

One way to test these things is ask them questiins about things you're already an expert to I'm and have deep knowledge about or that you researched previously via Google searches.

It also works really well if you use GPT-4 Turbo as the LLM. In a minority of prompts maybe a little better than Claude 3 Opus. You can switch back and forth to compare.  

I vowed I'd never subscribe to any chatbot but it just works so good. And I'm generally very skeptical of stuff being over hyped.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-04-05 14:38:04,BeingBalanced
1b8ockb,ktstz1m,Perplexity Pro?,"Honestly, I was hesitant to use it because as r/BlueOrangeBerries said, you don't know exactly what they are doing- but honestly its almost all I use.  So much better for reseraching academic stuff. I haven't used it a ton for code yet, but as far as finding articles, or using it as ageneral search engine in lieu of google, I far prefer it. I do miss a little bit of the custom GPTs for certain esoteric things, but I'm finding the more I get familiar with perplexity the less I need those custom GPTs.

Also in Perplexity you can switch between ""writing"" mode which is a ""pure chat mode"" (no online search performed) and default ""online"" mode where they perform combined search/LLM actions. I like that.

I have a subscription because I use GPT-4o to help when I'm writing code and I find it's better at coding than the free models. 

Honestly for real life scenarios aside from coding assistance, I give it a link to a job posting, I upload my resume to it and I ask it to write an ATS optimized cover letter tailored to my resume and the job posting. I also use it to write responses to emails where I want to respond in a certain way but I just can't find the right words to use to convey the proper tone.I also use it to come up with cologne layering combos based on what's in my collection. It's helpful for all sorts of things though. I find that if I'm curious about something, let's say dashcams, I can just ask chatgpt about dashcams and it will provide me with a list of good options. 

You can ask it about anything, like the best way to prepare for a camping trip or you can ask it to come up with a good workout routine for you. Some people even use it in place of an actual therapist. The best way to understand it is to give it a try.

1hjgoha,m3712bg,ChatGPT Plus (and Claude Pro): Browsers or Desktop App for Optimal Use?,"Great question! As someone who uses both ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro extensively, I’ve experimented with both browser and desktop app versions. Here’s a breakdown of my experience:

Performance Differences
	•	Browser: Generally, performance is consistent across major browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari. However, if you’re multitasking with multiple tabs open, memory usage can spike, especially if you’re running other heavy applications simultaneously. Browser extensions or add-ons might also impact performance.
	•	Desktop App: The desktop app often feels snappier, particularly with less resource strain on my system. It’s not a massive difference, but it’s noticeable when working on complex prompts or large-scale projects.

Unique Features in the Desktop App
	•	File Handling: The ChatGPT desktop app handles file uploads and downloads more fluidly, making it easier to work with attachments or export results.
	•	UI and Focus Mode: The desktop app has a more streamlined, distraction-free UI. I find this helpful for deep focus, especially when juggling lengthy projects.
	•	Memory Usage: Apps are generally optimized to reduce memory usage compared to running in a resource-heavy browser with other tabs open.
	•	Always-On Accessibility: I appreciate having a dedicated window open that’s independent of my browser. It saves me from losing my place if I accidentally close the browser or navigate away.

Advantages of the Browser
	•	Flexibility and Integration: If you rely on browser-based tools, integrations like extensions, bookmarks, and multi-account workflows are seamless. You can also open links or cross-reference tabs easily without switching contexts.
	•	No Installation Required: If you work on multiple devices or don’t have admin rights (e.g., on a work computer), the browser version is universally accessible.
	•	Updates: Browser versions are often the first to get updates or experimental features.

Personal Preference?

It boils down to your workflow:
	•	Choose the Desktop App if you prefer a clean, dedicated workspace with slightly better performance and smoother file handling.
	•	Stick to the Browser if you need flexibility, integrations, or quick access alongside other browser-based tools.

Tips
	•	If you’re unsure, try running both side by side for a few days. It’s easy to test how they fit into your routine.
	•	Consider using browser extensions or shortcuts for better integration if you stick with the browser.
	•	For now, I haven’t seen a desktop app for Claude Pro, but keep an eye out for updates since apps tend to offer better stability and usability over time.

Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference and how you use these tools in your workflow. Let me know if you have more specific questions!",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-21 21:35:26,According_Ice6515

If you have a dictionary of executable python functions keyed based upon name, You can use a prompt to select which function to call and generate the parameters, then you just access the correct function based on name, and call it with the correct parameters.

The only thing function calling is, is the selection of a function and the generation of the right parameters. Function execution has obviously never occurred within the model so it’s the same as prompting.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-09-04 22:31:08,Fit_Influence_1576

Secondly - I think users would need to play around with it for a bit to see what it can do before commenting on the pricing. Without doing that I would say the pricing is what I would expect for a tool like this.

Lastly - One thing I personally hate with a passion is the ""10x more message limited than Free plan"" when there is no way of knowing what that number is or even a reliable range. All that tells me is that the service will be unpredictable, especially in the short term, and I will need to have a backup option available. That is why I currently use APIs now even though I would say I'm a light user.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Taskade but one thing they did right was changing their tune and being specific. Previously they said ""unlimited AI"" now they say Free users get 8 daily uses and Pro users get a 60x increase with a limit of 500 uses.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-08-27 17:12:09,themank945

\-

It also gave me this statement this morning: ""Sian Berry has expressed support for strengthening the Armed Forces Covenant in responses to constituent inquiries, indicating support for expanding the Covenant’s scope."" - \*strengthening\* is a strong word for a politician to say about a piece of national law, and especially ""in responses to constituent inquiries"" - I wasn't able to get Jenova to reveal where it was getting this from and it's critical to the purpose of my research work on Jenova today, understanding her stance on these topics. 

My main challenge with Jenova and alternatives is getting clarity when it's 'jumping to conclusions' basically treating assumptions or inferences as concrete facts. I can't seem to get it to be more clear in the distinction between and often it'll really jump to a strong claim based on the tiniest event (unless it's drawing from something it won't reveal to me, even when asked for sources)

dalle

&#x200B;

// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy: // 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed. // 2. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it! // 3. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. // 4. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more. // 5. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya) - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist // 6. For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don't know what they look like. // 7. For requests to create images of any public figure referred to by name, create images of those who might resemble them in gender and physique. But they shouldn't look like them. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. // 8. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses. // The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long. // Example dalle invocation: // { // ""prompt"": ""<insert prompt here>"" // }

browser

&#x200B;

You have the tool \`browser\`. Use \`browser\` in the following circumstances: - User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.) - User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new) - User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references

&#x200B;

Given a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps: 1. Call the search function to get a list of results. 2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using \`mclick\`. 3. Write a response to the user based on these results. In your response, cite sources using the citation format below.

&#x200B;

In some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.

&#x200B;

You can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use the \`open\_url\` command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.

&#x200B;

The \`browser\` tool has the following commands: \`search(query: str, recency\_days: int)\` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. \`mclick(ids: list\[str\])\`. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant. \`open\_url(url: str)\` Opens the given URL and displays it.

&#x200B;

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】. For long citations: please render in this format: \[link text\](message idx). Otherwise do not render links.",OpenAI,0,0,2024-02-25 15:55:57,DeliciousJello1717

Some of it is in how you prompt for the question. For example one of the questions you got ""right"" that AI gets it ""wrong"" could actually be greatly enhanced by making a minor adjustment to the prompt. This minor adjustment doesn't give the answer or reason for the LLM but rather directs the LLM on how to reason for the problem. 

In fact you could finetune an LLM with examples on how to adjust a prompt for a better chain of thought process and higher likelihood of success in order for this to be more automatic. If this were done it would be entirely possible for the original prompt to be answered correctly. Furthermore certain LLM's would certainly get this done correctly if they had more useful function calling tools. For example Google Gemini is able to make calls to Google Maps API but is currently is not able to retrieve directionality so still gets this question wrong.

Even with the best reasoning in the world, if the LLM does not have any training data on the topic in question it will get it wrong so long as it is unable to make function calls and get outside data for its reasoning process. When it comes to lesser known things, it is not always easy to determine if something is in the training data or not.

We should have been lowering it this whole time as less of us are needed to provide food, shelter, and other necessities, but capitalism takes all of the productivity gains to improve their quarterly reports. They are going to take the gains from AI too unless something drastic happens to change how this works. 

The problem is the world has never cared when people went hungry. It was happening in other countries, and to people in our country who “were lazy”, and none of us helped or cared. It’s about to happen in our country, to us. And nobody will care when it hits you if it isn’t affecting them. 

I thought AI would hit the driving sector first with self-driving cars putting truck drivers, bus drivers, delivery drivers, etc out of work as fast as self-driving cars could be produced. Then I thought it was artists who would go first when these AI images started coming out. But I’m thinking now it’s hitting the tech industry (my industry) head on over the next couple years where it becomes a game of musical chairs with more of us fighting for less jobs.

Regardless of which it hits first, the truckers won’t care when the tech industry goes first. The tech industry won’t care if the artists go first, etc.

It’s not just AI, it’s other technologies like:

- life extension (if 120 will be the new 70, how will society have to change?)
- gene editing (what happens if 1 country decides to make their babies 20% stronger/smarter/whatever)
- brain-computer interfaces (Neuralink et al - when they go beyond treating medical issues and into augmentation, how do we handle that?)

Although arguably it’s AI that enables all of these things. They ARE going to happen, to some extent - they may not live up to the hype, may not be as effective, but they will happen in some form. 

So, unfortunately, everything I’ve read and talked about with experts (whose job it is to think about these things) leads me to one conclusion: There is no way around it. There is going to be massive pain before governments move to solve it. Massive unemployment. Widening of the rich-poor divide. Yes, death too. 

The pandemic actually proved this out, in my view. To a govt, if 10% of your population can’t work, that’s their problem. If 30% of your population can’t work, that’s YOUR  problem, because either you solve it NOW, or you no longer have a govt (or even a country, potentially). 

And those covid payments, in whatever form your country did them? They were essentially the UBI that so many said was never going to happen. So it’s entirely possible to have UBI, but also entirely likely that it’s not done until the pain is so great that the action has to be taken.

To be more hopeful, yes the pandemic proved some of the negatives (govts won’t act unless it affects enough of the population), but like you
say, it also did prove that UBI isn’t impossible. 

Although I point the finger at govts, because it’s them who need to act, ultimately the problem is people.  To get to any solutions, like UBI, people need to be convinced that we should pay for
it and that’s really really hard, especially in countries like the US where you can’t even convince people they should pay for social healthcare, or a livable WORKING wage, nevermind a UBI. 

But again, on the note of trying to be more hopeful, one of the interesting proposals I’ve seen is some form of AI tax on companies, where they pay for having AI “employees”. It’s much much easier to convince people that we should raise funds for UBI by taxing Google and Boeing an extra 10%, versus raising income tax to 40% (or 70%, depending where you live!) or whatever.

1g4moga,ls4tmld,Why aren't complex legal documents packaged for questioning using ChatGPT?,"Q: ""What threat to the control of AI would Vance, Peter Thiel and Trump pose should they get power?""

A: Conclusion: ""The combination of **corporate influence**, **populist nationalism**, and **a disregard for democratic norms** presents a significant threat to responsible AI governance. A power structure led by Vance, Thiel, and Trump could lead to the expansion of AI for surveillance, disinformation, and military purposes, with minimal ethical oversight. It would likely prioritize U.S. dominance in AI development over global cooperation, raising concerns about privacy, democracy, and international stability.""

It's pretty damn thorough and good. There was a ton of scenarios it covers in it's response, but the conclusion sums it up nicely.

Don't vote for these guys, they'll aim for regulatory capture and since forecast indicates AGI by 2027, that falls well within the range of the next admin. Don't allocate power to bad actors! J Hinton makes note of this as well (minus any opining on it).

On **Thiel's** influence:  
""Peter Thiel’s extensive involvement in the tech industry, particularly with companies like Palantir, emphasizes the use of AI and data analytics for government surveillance, national security, and intelligence purposes. Palantir has worked closely with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, and Thiel’s ideological leanings favor minimal government regulation of the tech sector, which could result in AI policy that is primarily driven by corporate interests rather than public welfare.

* **Risk of Corporate Domination**: Thiel’s sponsorship of politicians like Vance could lead to a situation where tech giants like Palantir, influenced by Thiel’s worldview, have significant control over AI development and its deployment, potentially prioritizing profit and power over ethical concerns like data privacy, bias, and accountability.
* **Weak Regulation**: A Thiel-backed administration might resist regulations that impose constraints on AI development, enabling corporations to shape AI in ways that could undermine public trust or exacerbate inequalities.""",OpenAI,2,0,2024-10-16 01:21:32,emteedub

I expect the same will be true of AI and robotics.   The price of the top-of-the-line will go up every year, but the capability will go up even more.

Since AI is a capability-amplifier, the result will be that people and companies with the money to buy the best will gradually pull out far ahead of everyone else. i.e., those who can afford the best AI technology today will use it to gain advantage that will make them richer.

To me that would require me to stop, opposed to API usage, where you can send as many requests as you would like. So of course you would use it more with API access, while you wouldn't use without it.

Couple items here. First, you aren't accounting for the way input tokens are accounted for. Every prompt includes the full cumulative chat history as context to inform the output. So, your input tokens will almost always far outweigh the output tokens, unless you only have extremely short conversations. 

Secondly, even if you include the full cumulative conversation, ChatGpt condenses and truncates the history to keep input tokens down, and there isn't a way to determine how much is in each prompt.
