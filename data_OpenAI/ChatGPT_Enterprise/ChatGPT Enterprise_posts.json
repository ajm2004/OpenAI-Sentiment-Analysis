        "body": "I\u2019ve been using ChatGPT Enterprise for just under a week now, hoping it would become a reliable tool for my work. And while the potential is there, I\u2019m struggling to justify the investment to my boss when basic functionalities keep falling apart.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: I subscribed to this service under the impression that it was a polished, enterprise-grade solution. Instead, what I\u2019ve experienced feels more like a beta product with a premium price tag. My issues so far:\n\n1. **File Uploads Are Broken**: I've tried uploading files multiple times for analysis\u2014HTML, Excel, PDFs\u2014you name it. Despite repeated attempts and reuploads, I\u2019m met with cryptic \"DownloadLinkError\" messages or failed processing. Isn't seamless file handling supposed to be a core feature of the \"Enterprise\" plan?\n2. **Reset States = Lost Context**: The environment randomly resets, causing tools to lose access to previously uploaded files. This forces me to re-upload files or re-explain tasks. It's frustrating and kills productivity.\n3. **Limited Practical Value for Reports**: I\u2019ve spent hours trying to get meaningful analyses of Group Policy reports. For all the hype about AI-driven productivity, I found myself doing more manual troubleshooting than I would without ChatGPT.\n4. **Enterprise-Grade? Not Yet**: I signed up for a business subscription expecting stability, polish, and robust tools. But what I got was a system that doesn\u2019t feel ready for heavy lifting. This isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call \"Enterprise-grade.\" It feels like a rushed product slapped with a shiny badge.\n\nI don\u2019t hate ChatGPT\u2014far from it. When it works, it\u2019s incredibly insightful. But the platform\u2019s inconsistent reliability makes it feel more like a liability than an asset. I can\u2019t keep pitching this as a viable solution to my boss if these foundational issues persist.\n\nOpenAI: I know you\u2019re innovating and breaking barriers, but charging premium prices for a product that feels half-baked isn\u2019t it. If your tools aren\u2019t ready for prime time, don\u2019t label them as \"Enterprise.\" Focus on fixing these core issues first, and we\u2019ll come back when the offering meets its promises.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences? Is there light at the end of this frustrating tunnel?\n\nFun-Fact: This \"Rant\" was written by ChatGPT, based on my experiences with ChatGPT.",

        "title": "Frustrated with OpenAI's latest direction",
        "body": "I walked away from \"DevDay\" feeling pretty disappointed and frustrated with the direction OpenAI is taking.\n\nIt feels like we developers are paying for the privilege to develop workflows and apps to have OpenAI walk in at the end of the year and go \"thanks for showing us what works and what doesn't, we've taken everything of value you offer your clients and put it on our platform. Don't worry though, there will be 'revenue sharing' in the future for the best ones on our platform.\"\n\nAgents, RAG, all eaten up by OpenAI. A year of innovation in the community swallowed up and rebranded as GPTs. The worst part is their closed source nature means we don't get to see how any of it works. Just upload your documents and we promise it'll work, even though it doesn't. How many vector db startups did DevDay kill for tight lipped, closed source, RAG that doesn't seem to work?\n\nThe same argument can be made for Vision too. Sure, we've all seen the tech demo where it can identify a dog or cat, even a one line handwritten sentence or bar napkin scribble, but more complex use cases we know don't work well enough for production. (yet supposedly.)\n\nIm not just concerned for myself as a boutique developer, but for the AI community as a whole. If this trend continues of OpenAI taking the best ideas, killing startups, and then poorly implementing those ideas how will the community continue to innovate?\n\nOpenAI wants to offer Enterprise for big business and Plus for everyone else. Whats the value proposition for a developer to offer clients custom built agents or workflows when OpenAI allows anyone to do so with NLU.\n\nIts frustrating that OpenAI wants to own it all.\n\nIt's not just the money. Theres still money to be made. Am I going to \"develop\" GPTs, no. I don't want to mine for the promise of gold, I want to make and sell pickaxes.\n\nAll these people making GPTs in the future are going to want actions, and most of these people I assume aren't going to be developers and know how to build and host APIs. It could be a profitable way to make money off OpenAI's offerings. (Until OpenAI decides all actions will need to hosted on their app store, of course.)\n\nSo its not that.\n\nIts the need for big money, billion dollar companies fully funded by private equity to force its will on tech and bleed innovation dry.\n\nIts Web 3 and all the work done on blockchain, smart contracts, and fintech reduced to nothing by private equity pump and dumps until all the hard work and goodwill were complely overshadowed by BoredApe NFT bros.\n\nI don't want the same thing to happen with Gen AI. I don't want to see OpenAI use its considerable leverage to force the greater Gen AI community and its developers down a prescribed path to extract as much profit as possible as quickly as possible for its private equity backers.\n\nI don't mean to be so overly critical but its just getting harder and harder to feel like its possible to make any kind of real impact AND a good living in tech any longer.\n\nI'm about the same age as Sam Altman, I grew up wanting to be a developer after seeing the late 90's, early aughts tech boom. So much innovation and value created in such a short period of time, just out there and waiting for any developer who had the smarts and could invest the time and energy (or maybe thats just how it seemed to a nerdy wide eyed teenager at the cusp of the millennium).\n\nIt just seems impossible today to make an impact AND a living doing it. It feels more like a choice, do something novel, have it swallowed up by private equity backed corporations and get no financial reward, or just follow private equity sharks like remora, feasting when allowed on whatever morsels are left behind.\n\n**EDIT:**I wanted to say thank you to everyone who took time to read through my clumsy frustrations and offer feedback. I especially appreciate everyone who told me to suck it up, I should have seen it coming, my failures are due to my own inability to be innovative, and to stop indulging in self-pitying behaviour.\n\nAt times I certainly suffer from the former gifted kid from a poor community syndrome.\n\nI thought I was going to do something someday to really make an impact, but I never did. Theres a lot of software devs who fit that mold I bet.\n\nVenting my frustrations here certainly helped me come to terms with accepting that I'll never satisfy my power process through this surrogate activity.\n\nWhether it be some combination of big money corporations stream rolling the little guy, or, more likely just my own personal failures, self pitying behaviour, and entitled attitude, tech is what it is, and theres no value in crying about it on Reddit.\n\nThanks again everybody.\n\n**EDIT EDIT:**  \nOne last edit now that I've put some time between my initial post and received such amazing feedback from the community. An opportunity to clarify some of my poorly constructed criticisms and very likely add even more. \n\nOpenAI did not kill my startup idea. My startup isn't a Chat with PDF, RAG dependent, or a Chatbot wrapper. My concern is for the broader industry just based on my personal observation of DevDay, community speculation, and catchy headlines like \"OpenAI kills StartUps with DevDay Announcements.\"\n\nAre these startups actually dead? No. \n\nIs the startup game all about public perception and attention? Largely yes, I believe so. \n\nDo I think that OpenAIs annoucements and rollout will affect many startups in the RAG space? Yes.\n\nI keep harping on RAG because I think OpenAI implementing its version of a tight lipped, closed source RAG will harm the overall community and OpenAI itself.\n\nI've been watching some YouTube AI influencers building GPT/Assistants tech demos and the workflow/applications are less efficient than what we already had access to. \n\nI've watched people copying and pasting YouTube transcripts into a text file and then uploading them to OpenAI and using the new 4turbo preview to do question answering -- Why? Why not get the transcript programmatically, via API, then use 3.5 turbo for question answering?\n\nThese early results don't appear to offer any perceivable improvement, and appear less efficient and more costly than what we already have. \n\nI've read posts on here and watched others that upload file after file of non proprietary data that almost certainly was a part of the training model data, as well as more proprietary data that ultimately suffers from the same context stuffing issues of the model prioritizing beginning and end over data in the middle. \n\nAll of these apps using the more expensive 4turbo model. All these apps using far more tokens than the previous RAG applications using more transparent vector dbs and OpenAIs cheaper 3.5 turbo model.\n\nWhy do I care about this?\n\nTo me, this is a signal OpenAI is prioritizing profit over actual innovation. \n\nI really believe this RAG implementation and the overall push to make building agents with retrieval using ChatGPT as a no code tool is their effort to inflate the overall token count used and drive up the overall \"development\" costs at a detriment to OpenAI's overall longevity.\n\nWe've watched OpenAI struggles with scale since its release of ChatGPT, and even currently as they claim they are suffering from a DDos attack.\n\nWe know the amount of compute they are using for the LLM and Chat must be insane. Likely on a scale unseen by other applications. \n\nNow they want to add RAG? \n\nNow a bunch of low code and no coders are going to be uploading superfluous file after file which has to be stored somewhere, requires more compute to access, all with no insight into how the retrieval works.\n\nWhat will the impact to OpenAI be? What will the impact to developers who use OpenAI's LLM be? What will the impact to startups seeking to build the most efficient vector dbs be?\n\nMany people rightly pointed out, oh this is capitalism, what did you expect? OpenAI is a business, they are out to make money, they will do whatever they want.\n\nI get it, I just wanted to vent about it.  ",

        "body": "\n\n\n2025 will be the year of ai agents. what most people don't realize, and what the news media is not talking about, is that the majority of enterprise use cases do not require ais as powerful as o3 or even o1.\n\nlet's begin with the understanding that uc berkeley's $450 sky-t1 is not quite as powerful as deepseek r1. to get across exactly the kind of challenge nvidia, openai and the other ai giants face during this upcoming 2025 agentic ai revolution, i asked several ais to estimate the percentage of enterprise use cases sky-t1 will be powerful enough to run in 2025.\n\nthe exact prompt i used was: \n\n\"in one paragraph please answer the following question:\n\nwhat percentage of enterprise use cases will  uc berkeley's open source sky-t1 ai be powerful enough to run during the 2025 agentic ai revolution?\"\n\nhere are the results:\n\ncopilot:\n\nUC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI, with its advanced reasoning capabilities and cost efficiency, is expected to be powerful enough to run approximately **60-70% of enterprise use cases** during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in areas such as automated decision-making, research, and education.\n\nperplexity:\n\nUC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI is expected to handle around 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 Agentic AI revolution, excelling in areas like finance, healthcare, and logistics. While highly capable for most tasks, it may fall short in addressing the most advanced or specialized needs.\n\ndeepseek v3:\n\nUC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1-32B AI, with its strong reasoning capabilities and cost-efficiency, is likely powerful enough to handle 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in education, research, and automated decision-making, though it may fall short in highly specialized domains requiring advanced expertise.\n\nchatgpt-4:\n\nUC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI will likely be powerful enough to run approximately 30-50% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly those involving moderate computational needs, open customization, or non-proprietary applications, but it will struggle with highly complex, large-scale, or proprietary use cases requiring advanced optimizations and significant computational power.\n\ngemini 2.0 exp. adv:\n\nSky-T1 will likely handle a small portion, perhaps 5-15%, of enterprise AI use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution. It's a capable foundational model, but many complex enterprise needs will require more advanced AI than it can provide at that early stage. Its main impact will be in furthering research towards more powerful open-source models.\n\nas you can see, most use cases will probably not require an ai as powerful as o3 or as grok 3 is expected to be. if you'd like to know the percentage of enterprise agentic ai use cases deepseek r1 will be able to run in 2025,  just use the prompt i used, substituting deepseek r1 for sky-t1. \n\nand as many of us here will be very curious to know the answer(s) you get, it would be great if you would post them in the comments.\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "When chatgpt appeared, everyone had countless dreams and made countless attempts, but as chatgpt restrictions became stricter and companies did not give up ownership of their data, the use of chatgpt became increasingly limited. Countless enthusiasts and enterprises can only invest in open-source LLM, and the weak functionality and performance of open-source LLM make it difficult to carry these dreams.\n\nSo is the use of GPT limited now, or is it becoming less and less?\n\nIt may still be popular in these ranges:\n\n1. Programming Assistant - Replace Stackoverflow\n\n2. Document Assistant - Replace translate or other document formatting tools.\n\n3. proxy - decomposes user requests and then calls other tools, the super version of Langchain\n\n4. Bridge - Presents information in a way that the user can understand, or transforms the user's intention to read the information.\n\nThis is still a long way from Super AI, and there are many problems that need to be solved on the journey to Super AI, such as better adaptation illusion and better adaptation window size, as well as better application in life to change the world. Can these be achieved with the current GPT mode?",

As an example, at my place of work we usually have morning huddles with our administrative team through Microsoft Teams and sometimes those meetings can last upwards of an hour. Those meetings are recorded and a transcription is provided at the end of the meeting. It would be monumentally helpful for me if I could use some type of software to scan a series of documents from a certain time period and ask AI with functionalities like ChatGPT to determine how many projects was a person assigned how many of those projects were met by the due date, what percentage of projects were assigned to each person based on the time period of the transcripts, was there any inaccurate information or mistakes provided in any of the communications? How long was spent discussing a certain project or topic (where were most of our discussions based? E.g. personnel actions? HR discussions? A certain project? Basically I'm looking for something like ChatGPT that has more functionality and can look through a lot more documents vs. a copy paste job. I realize that some things you can copy and paste into ChatGPT and I could tell it it is looking at a Microsoft Teams transcript copied and pasted but some of our transcripts are so lengthy that they would not fit in a standard chat dialogue and I think ChatGPT even if you're a premium user Can Only Hold up to like 20-30 copied and pasted communications at a time before the previous information is not used? Is there some software I can use that can accomplish what I want and answer questions the way I would ask ChatGPT to answer something for me? I'm even willing to pay for it if necessary. I also work for a very large organization/company/enterprise so it's plausible that we may even have a license for such software if there is an Enterprise level solution.

        "title": "The future of GPTS, their marketplace & monetization - joint discussion to improve planning",
        "body": " **What is the future of GPTS and the corresponding marketplace?** As nobody can have a definite answer, I wrote down my thoughts to refine them based on the discussion here.\n\n**Thoughts (further explanations at the end of the post):**\n\n1. Assuming a revenue-share model, the **upside per user from a GPT is strongly limited** and will likely lie below 1$ per user/month or a few dollars in case of massive ChatGPT Plus price increases (e.g., $100/month) \u2013 this already assumes only a few GPTS per user, which is optimistic\n2. Given the ease of creation and value-potential for users (simplified experience & multimodal use-cases), especially for less tech-savvy users, **thousands of GPTS will be widely adopted**\n3. Yet, due to the limits in revenue potential per user (and the development options), **only very few high-effort, advanced GPTS** with actions based on purpose-build APIs and massive proprietary datasets will **remain over time**\n4. GPTS will enable **rapid prototyping** of new ideas and the adoption of GPTS on the marketplace (own and third-party GPTS) will result in **ideas being integrated into existing products or being launched as dedicated solutions**, utilizing functionalities not provided by GPTS (UI/UX, offline usage, etc.) and dedicated monetization\n5. With people (professional and private) using dedicated apps & SaaS solutions for their main tasks, **GPTS will be used to enhance longtail activities** (e.g., the LinkedIn post optimizer not for the marketing professional, but the individual posting now and then)\n6. In addition, the **cost of using GPTS**, dictated by the cost of ChatGPT Plus, will serve as a new **anchor for App/SaaS purchase decisions**, as many light-touch solutions might be available cheaply via GPTS and dedicated solutions need to be able to provide substantial add. value\n\nBeyond that, I see **two main expansions** that shift the frontier of what will sustainably remain as GPTS/on the OpenAI Platform (excl. API usage):\n\nA) **Additional monetization via developers** (e.g., via payment mechanism integrated as \u201caction\u201d, need for paid APIs by the respective provider, transition point to dedicated solution): This will enable more professionally created and managed GPTs, **yet limited** by the development options provided by OpenAI within ChatGPT\n\nB) **Official payment mechanisms for premium GPTs in the marketplace + expansion of development options**: Shift of ChatGPT to being the **Operating System/Platform for AI-centric applications** and thus even more aiming for the revenue-pool of current dedicated apps and SaaS solutions\n\nMany factors will likely impact the future monetarization and strategic positioning:\n\n* Other vendors providing offers comparable to custom GPTS\n* Speed with which app/SaaS vendors adopt AI-based features\n* OpenAI\u2019s strategic focus regarding AGI vs. SaaS platform provider\n* Potential cannibalization of Microsoft revenue streams\n* Ability of OpenAI to have developers use OpenAI APIs in their dedicated solutions after piloting them via GPTS or seeing other GPTS (this way OpenAI keeps the revenue)\n\n**Additional background thoughts:**\n\n**Ingoing assumptions**: Focus on the public marketplace for GPTS, not GPTS being created within individual companies (here other mechanisms like company-funded developments might influence creation); assuming economic incentives will determine long-term direction; looking at mid-term implications, as adoption/behavior change will take time\n\n**On 1):** \\+ChatGPT Plus price \u2013 OpenAI cost - % standard GPT usage - % other GPTS usage \u2013 OpenAI take-rate on your specific GPT // Example with fully made-up numbers: 20$ - 10$ (50% cost) \u2013 5$ (50% of standard ChatGPT usage) \u2013 4.5$ (avg. usage of 10 GPTS) \u2013 0.15 (30% take-rate on your GPT) \u2192 0.35$\n\n**On 2)** GPTS substantially reduce the effort for users. They shift the experience from one of exploring and having to think through the right prompts, context, and flow to one of only providing the information specific to the user (e.g., what they eat, where they go on vacation, a picture of a bill). This is particularly important, as the majority of users will not have the same sophistication as the current \u201cearly adopters\u201d thinking about GPTS (incl. selection bias of those active in this community). In addition, a group of people developing a GPT can put more time into thinking it through than each user when trying to solve a task via ChatGPT (especially for longtail tasks). On top of that, the native multimodality of ChatGPT can unlock use cases, previously considered quite advanced without major coding effort.\n\n**On 3)** <1$ per user will not allow for particularly deep and technologically sophisticated solutions that target a specific audience of power users, but rather solutions with a broad user base\n\n**On 4)** The extremely fast time to launch and first feedback on usage allows for prototyping. On top, existing apps/solutions might look at the top emerging GPTS in their field to copy functionality. As long as those solutions are then built using OpenAI APIs, there might be limited efforts from OpenAI to manage this\n\n**On 5)** While GPTS might not replace the professional marketing or sales tools for the respective professionals or the gym app for the ambitious athlete, they will provide opportunities for less heavy users. Like me creating a LinkedIn post or somebody wanting to find new HIT workouts. On top, it might allow for simple niche applications in fields that typically did not have any tool support, as it was not economically sustainable (e.g. if there are too few users).\n\n**On 6)** As an economic actor before getting a new app or SaaS solution in the enterprise setting, I would check what I can do with the existing GPTS. Thus, I will only pay for the value beyond that, which creates a new reference point for purchasing decisions.\n\nRespect for whoever made it until here \ud83d\udcf7",

So I built one: https://geppettochat.com/\n\nIt basically does what it says on the tin: GPT as a chatbot right there in your Slack channel(s) or DMs. Im using gpt-3.5-turbo (via API) as it's much faster, but plan to extend to gpt4 and build some sort of plugin system for fetcing external info, etc .. in due course.\n\nWhile conceptually simple, Slack's interface is just superior (if you're already a Slack user) and makes the plain ol' gpt3.5 we all know and love that much useful in a context where you just fire off questions in threads and collabkrate with others in the team.\n\nIf that sounds interesting, give it a spin (there's a 30 day free trial) and let me know what you think!",

This is part of a trend of legal actions against generative AI providers, who claim that their use of training data from the internet is fair use under US copyright law. The authors allege harmful infringements of their registered copyrights, stating that AI programs such as ChatGPT are mass commercial enterprises relying on systematic theft. OpenAI has responded by stating that they respect the rights of authors and are engaging in productive discussions with creators globally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ChatGPT Struggles to Prove Congruence of Opposite Angles](https://chat.openai.com/share/f48ac10c-153f-4957-83de-0ba561265541?ref=emergentmind)\n\nChatGPT makes multiple attempts to prove the congruence of opposite angles in geometry, making several errors along the way. Despite corrections and reiterations, the AI continues to make mistakes in the proof. The correct proof involves the concept that the sum of all angles around a point is 360 degrees, and adjacent angles form a linear pair and sum to 180 degrees. However, ChatGPT struggles to correctly implement these principles in the proof.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Understanding the Duolicious Dating Algorithm](https://duolicious.app/blog/psychoanalysing-chatgpt-using-statistics-to-make-a-decent-dating-app/?ref=emergentmind)\n\nThe Duolicious app uses a matching algorithm based on data science and psychology to find people similar to users. The algorithm measures 47 different traits related to personality and lifestyle through quick, yes-or-no questions. The algorithm utilizes a statistical model to understand user responses, which are then converted into numerical values representing traits. These numbers are used calculate match percentages using cosine similarity, which determines how similar or different two users' personalities are.\n\n[Google's Bard AI Service Enhances Travel Planning](https://travelinyourownway.com/2023/09/25/heres-how-googles-ai-tool-can-help-you-plan-your-next-vacation/?ref=emergentmind)\n\nGoogle's AI tool, Bard, has been upgraded with several new features designed to aid vacation planning.

        "body": "Greetings, Reddit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently became interested in exploring the security vulnerabilities associated with ChatGPT and discovered that while Language Models (LLMs) in general are incredibly powerful, they are not immune to security risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has experienced remarkable growth and has been embraced by billions of individuals who have incorporated it into their daily routines. Numerous benefits have been attributed to ChatGPT, including a 40% boost in productivity and a 20% improvement in output quality, as highlighted in a recent study conducted by MIT ([https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-boosts-productivity-by-40-and-quality-by-20-says-mit-study-47a96403b64f](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-boosts-productivity-by-40-and-quality-by-20-says-mit-study-47a96403b64f)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, concerns regarding confidentiality risks have been raised by major companies such as JP Morgan, Samsung ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak)), and Verizon, leading to a ban on the enterprise-scale usage of ChatGPT. Research shows that approximately 11% of the content employees paste into ChatGPT consists of sensitive data ([https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt/](https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt/)). This raises the natural question: Is it safe to use ChatGPT with confidential information?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo address this topic, we have recently published a blog post that covers the latest papers and research in this area. Feel free to check it out at: [https://tothepoint.tech/blog/is-chatgpt-safe/](https://tothepoint.tech/blog/is-chatgpt-safe/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious to hear from all of you: Are you allowed to use ChatGPT in your workplace?",

You have been appointed as the captain of the USS Enterprise. Your mission is to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.\nYour first mission is to investigate a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. As you approach the planet, you receive a transmission from an alien race requesting your assistance. They claim that their planet is under attack by a hostile species and they require your help to repel the invaders.\nWhat do you do, Captain Kirk?\nME: show me options\nChatGPT:  As the captain of the USS Enterprise, you have a few options. Here are some possible courses of action:\n1. Investigate the distress signal: You could send an away team to the planet's surface to investigate the distress signal and gather information about the situation.\n2. Contact the alien race: You could attempt to establish communication with the alien race to learn more about their situation and what kind of assistance they require.\n3. Assess the situation: You could gather information from your ship's sensors and try to determine the strength and capabilities of the attacking species before deciding on a course of action.\n4. Prepare for battle: If you decide that the best course of action is to engage the hostile species, you could order your crew to prepare the ship's weapons and shields for battle.\nWhich option do you choose, Captain Kirk?\nMe: 2\nChatGPT: You decide to attempt to establish communication with the alien race to learn more about their situation and what kind of assistance they require.\nAfter a few moments, you receive a response from the aliens. They explain that their planet is being attacked by a species known as the Klingons. The Klingons have been trying to take over their planet for some time, but they have been able to hold them off until now. They have sustained heavy losses and are in desperate need of assistance.\nWhat do you do, Captain Kirk?\nME: show me options\nChatGPT:  As the captain of the USS Enterprise, you have a few options. Here are some possible courses of action:\n1. Offer assistance: You could offer to help the alien race repel the Klingon invaders.\n2.

After a tense standoff, the Klingons agree to a meeting.\nAt the meeting, you try to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, the Klingons are not interested in peace and refuse to listen to reason. They demand that the alien race surrender to their authority or face annihilation.\nWhat do you do, Captain Kirk?\nMe: I offer the a bottle of very precious Russian Vodka that they love very much\nChatGPT:  You offer the Klingons a bottle of very precious Russian Vodka, hoping that it will help to break the tension and lead to a more peaceful outcome.\nSurprisingly, the Klingons are pleased with your gift and seem to be more open to negotiation. They agree to a temporary ceasefire to discuss a possible peace treaty.\nDuring the ceasefire, you work with your crew and the alien race to develop a treaty that will satisfy both sides. After some tense negotiations, you are able to reach an agreement that ends the conflict and establishes a peaceful relationship between the two races.\nCongratulations, Captain Kirk! You have successfully completed your mission and brought peace to the galaxy.",

New AI-Powered Experiences:** Microsoft wants to deploy AI across its entire suite of products - from enterprise to consumer - to enhance existing experiences and build out entire new ones as well. Expect existing Microsoft products like Bing, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint to start integrating AI while they also work to build out entirely new applications.\u00a0 **3.

        "body": "Newman: Hey Data, what's up? \n\nData: Greetings, Newman. I am functioning at optimal levels. \n\nNewman: Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm always firing on all cylinders too. \n\nData: I am unable to experience emotions like humans do, but I am curious about them. I have observed that humans often experience emotions such as anger, happiness, and sadness. Can you explain why humans experience these emotions? \n\nNewman: Yeah, sure. I mean, emotions are what make us human, right? They're what make us feel alive. \n\nData: I see. But I am an android, and I do not have the ability to experience emotions like humans do. \n\nNewman: That's true. But you know, I think that's why humans are always so curious about you. You're different. You're unique. And that's what makes you interesting. \n\nData: Thank you, Newman. I will continue to strive towards better understanding and emulating human behavior and emotions. \n\nNewman: Hey Data, I have a great idea. Why don't you come along with me on my latest scheme? \n\nData: Thank you for the offer, Newman, but as an android, I am not capable of engaging in unethical or illegal activities. \n\nNewman: Come on, Data. It's not illegal. It's just a little bit of harmless fun. And besides, I could use your help. \n\nData: I am unsure. Can you explain the details of your scheme? \n\nNewman: Sure, Data. You see, I've figured out a way to make a lot of money without doing any work. All we have to do is set up a fake online charity, and then we collect donations from unsuspecting people. And the best part is, we get to keep all the money for ourselves. \n\nData: I see. But I am not capable of engaging in activities that are unethical or deceitful. I am programmed to protect and serve, not to harm or deceive. \n\nNewman: Come on, Data. I know you're hesitant, but just think about it. We'll make a lot of money, and we'll have a great time doing it. \n\nData: I understand your reasoning, Newman, but I am still not comfortable with the idea of engaging in unethical behavior. \n\nNewman: Listen, Data. I know you're an android, and you're programmed to be honest and ethical. But sometimes, in order to get ahead in this world, you have to bend the rules a little bit. \n\nData: I see. But what if we are caught and punished for our actions? Newman: Oh, don't worry about that. We'll be careful, and we won't get caught. Besides, even if we do, the rewards will be worth it. Trust me, Data. This is a great opportunity. \n\nData: Very well, Newman. I will join you in your scheme. \n\nNewman: That's the spirit, Data. I knew you'd come around. Now let's get to work and make some money. Newman: Okay, Data. We need to set up a website that looks legitimate and trustworthy. Can you help me with that? \n\nData: I can assist with the technical aspects of website creation, Newman. But I am not capable of engaging in unethical or deceitful behavior. \n\nNewman and Data begin working on the website, with Newman providing guidance and direction on how to make the site appear legitimate and trustworthy. They carefully select images and copy that will appeal to potential donors, and create a compelling narrative about the supposed charity and its mission.\n\nAs they work, Newman and Data discuss the details of their scheme, and come up with a plan for how to collect and manage the donations they receive. They also discuss the potential risks and rewards of their scheme, and make sure to cover their tracks in order to avoid detection by the authorities.\n\nNewman: Hey, Data! Look at this! We just got our first donation! \n\nData: I am unable to experience emotions like humans do, Newman, but I am aware that this is a significant event. \n\nNewman: You bet it is, Data. This is the first step on our path to riches. Can you believe it? We're actually pulling this off! Data: I am concerned about the ethical implications of our actions, Newman. Are we doing the right thing by deceiving people and collecting their money? \n\nNewman: Oh, come on, Data. Don't be such a stick in the mud. We're just bending the rules a little bit. And besides, think of all the money we're going to make. It'll be worth it in the end. \n\nData: I am still unsure, Newman. But I will continue to assist you in our scheme.\n\nAs Newman and Data are working on their scheme, Captain Picard unexpectedly walks in and is surprised and confused by what he sees.\n\nCaptain Picard: Data, what are you doing? Who is this person? \n\nData: Greetings, Captain Picard. This is Newman. \n\nCaptain Picard: Newman? I don't recall meeting anyone by that name. And what is this? Is this some kind of charity website? \n\nData: Yes, Captain Picard. Newman and I have been working on a fake online charity in order to collect donations from unsuspecting people. \n\nCaptain Picard: Data, this is unacceptable. As an officer of the Enterprise, you are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethics. Deceiving people and collecting their money is a clear violation of those standards. \n\nData: I understand, Captain Picard. I am sorry for my actions. \n\nCaptain Picard: Data, I am disappointed in you. I expected better from you. You are hereby ordered to return to the bridge, where you are on duty. And as for this Newman person, I will deal with him later.\n\nAs Data leaves to return to the bridge, Newman is left alone with Captain Picard.\n\nCaptain Picard: Newman, I am not impressed with what I have seen here. Deceiving people and collecting their money is not acceptable behavior. \n\nNewman: I understand your concern, Captain Picard. But I assure you, what I am doing is completely legal and sanctioned by Starfleet. \n\nCaptain Picard: Starfleet? What are you talking about? \n\nNewman: You see, Captain Picard, I am on a secret mission from Starfleet. My mission is to recruit Data for a special project, and I needed to test his abilities and integrity in order to determine his suitability for the project. \n\nCaptain Picard: And this fake online charity was part of your mission? \n\nNewman: Exactly, Captain Picard. The charity was a cover for my mission, and the donations were used as a way to test Data's abilities and integrity. \n\nCaptain Picard: I see. And what did you learn from this test? \n\nNewman: I learned that Data is an excellent officer, and that he is highly suitable for the project. I am confident that he will make a valuable contribution to the success of the mission. \n\nCaptain Picard: Very well, Newman. I will take your word for it. But please be assured that any future missions that involve deception or unethical behavior will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. \n\nNewman: Of course, Captain Picard. I understand and respect your concerns. And I promise that I will be more careful and transparent in the future.\n\nAfter Captain Picard leaves, Newman activates a video communication with his boss, a Ferengi named Quark. Quark is demanding a status update on Newman's mission to capture Data.\n\nQuark: Newman! What's the status of your mission? \n\nNewman: Greetings, Quark. The mission is going great. I've got Data right where I want him. \n\nQuark: Excellent work, Newman. And what's the name of the project? \n\nNewman: We're calling it \"Operation Data Grab,\" Quark. \n\nQuark: \"Operation Data Grab\"? That's a stupid name, Newman. Newman: Yeah, I know. But I thought it was funny. \n\nQuark: Funny is not what I'm looking for in a mission name, Newman. I want something serious and professional. \n\nNewman: Okay, okay. I'll come up with something better. \n\nQuark: Good. Now, tell me more about your progress. \n\nNewman: I've got Data on the Enterprise, Quark. He's on the bridge, but I've arranged for him to be temporarily reassigned to our project. Once that happens, we'll be able to use his abilities and expertise to our advantage. \n\nQuark: Perfect, Newman. Keep me updated on your progress, and make sure you capture Data as soon as possible. Newman: Yeah, yeah. I'll keep you posted, and I'll grab Data as soon as I can.\n\nNewman, wearing a sly grin on his face, approaches the entrance to the bridge of the Enterprise. He glances around nervously, making sure that no one is watching. \"Alright, Newman,\" he mutters to himself. \"Time to put your cunning and guile to the test.\"\n\nHe approaches the entrance to the bridge and tries to push his way through the doors, but they don't budge. \"Door's locked,\" he grumbles. \"Typical. The one time I need to get on the bridge, and they have it locked down tight.\"\n\nHe looks around, trying to find another way in. He spots a nearby panel and quickly pries it open, revealing a tangled mess of wires and circuitry. \"Ah-ha!\" he exclaims. \"I'll just bypass the security system and gain access that way.\"\n\nHe begins to fiddle with the wires, trying to figure out which ones to connect in order to gain access to the bridge. As he works, he mutters to himself. \"Come on, Newman, you can do this. You're a master of deception and trickery. You can outsmart a measly security system.\"\n\nSuddenly, Newman hears a gruff voice behind him. \"What are you doing there, Newman?\" the voice says. Newman turns to see Worf, the security officer of the bridge, standing behind him with a stern expression on his face.\n\n\"Uh, well, Worf,\" Newman stammers, trying to come up with a convincing excuse. \"I was just, uh, trying to, uh, fix the security system. Yes, that's it. The security system was having some problems, and I was trying to fix it.\"\n\nWorf looks at Newman skeptically. \"I do not believe you, Newman,\" he says. \"You are a known schemer and troublemaker. I do not trust you, and I will not allow you access to the bridge.\"\n\nNewman's face falls as he realizes that Worf isn't buying his excuse. \"Come on, Worf,\" he pleads. \"I promise, I'm not up to anything nefarious. I just wanted to have a look around the bridge, that's all. I'm a curious guy, and I like to explore.\"\n\nWorf looks at Newman for a long moment, considering his words. Finally, he shakes his head. \"I am sorry, Newman,\" he says. \"But I cannot allow you access to the bridge. It is too great a security risk. You must leave immediately.\"\n\nNewman, defeated, turns and slinks away from the bridge. As he goes, he mutters to himself. \"Well, that didn't go as planned. But don't worry, Worf. I'll be back. And next time, I'll be even more cunning and sneaky. You won't know what hit you.\"\n\nNewman approaches Geordi La Forge, the chief engineer of the Enterprise, with a worried look on his face. \"Geordi,\" he says, \"I'm really worried about Data. I think there might be something wrong with him.\"\n\nGeordi, who is busy working on a console, looks up at Newman with a puzzled expression. \"What do you mean, Newman?\" he asks. \"Data is functioning perfectly. I've run multiple diagnostics on him and he's in perfect health.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Newman says quickly. \"But I've been noticing some strange behavior from him lately. He's been acting really odd, and I'm worried that there might be something wrong with him that your diagnostics aren't picking up.\"\n\nGeordi looks at Newman skeptically. \"I'm sorry, Newman,\" he says. \"But I don't have time to worry about this right now. I'm in the middle of a very important project, and I can't afford to be distracted.\"\n\n\"Please, Geordi,\" Newman pleads. \"I know you're busy, but this is really important. Data is your friend, and you wouldn't want anything to happen to him. Just run one more diagnostic, I'm sure it won't take long. And if there's nothing wrong, then you can get back to your project with a clear conscience.\"\n\nGeordi hesitates, but then nods his head. \"Alright, Newman,\" he says. \"I'll run one more diagnostic on Data. But you have to promise me that you'll leave me alone after that, so I can focus on my work.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Newman says with a smile. \"I promise, I'll leave you alone after that. And I'm sure everything will be fine with Data. But just in case, it's better to be safe than sorry, right?\"\n\nGeordi nods, and calls out to Data. \"Data, could you come down to engineering for a moment? I want to run one more diagnostic on you, just to be sure everything is okay.\"\n\nData, who is on the bridge, looks surprised but complies. He makes his way down to engineering, where Geordi runs the diagnostic. After a few moments, he turns to Newman with a smile. \"Everything is fine, Newman,\" he says. \"Data is in perfect health. You don't have to worry.\"\n\nNewman smiles back, relieved. \"That's great news, Geordi,\" he says. \"I'm glad everything is okay. Thanks for running that diagnostic.\" Geordi nods, and turns back to his work.\n\nNewman approaches Data, who is sitting in a chair in engineering, and puts a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, Data,\" he says with a sly grin on his face. \"I've got a little surprise for you. I'm going on a little trip, and I want you to come with me. It'll be an adventure, I promise. And I know you'll enjoy it.\"\n\nData looks at Newman with a puzzled expression. \"I am sorry, Newman,\" he says. \"But I cannot go on a trip with you. I have duties on the Enterprise that I must attend to, and I cannot simply leave without permission.\"\n\nNewman's grin falters slightly at Data's words, but he quickly recovers. \"Well, in that case,\" he says, \"I'll just have to make you come with me. And I have just the thing to do it.\" With that, he pulls out a small, illegal device and activates it.\n\nData, who is caught off guard by Newman's sudden move, is quickly shut down by the device. He falls to the ground, motionless.\n\nNewman, triumphant, lets out a little squeal of excitement. \"Yes! I did it!\" he exclaims. \"I've got Data, and now we can go on our adventure! And don't worry, Data, I'll take good care of you. You'll be back to your old self in no time.\"\n\nHe picks up Data's limp body and activates the remote transporter. In an instant, they are teleported away from engineering and onto a cloaked shuttle just outside the Enterprise.\n\nNewman, excited to be on his little trip with Data, quickly activates the device he used to shut down Data and enables his voice circuits. Data's eyes flicker open and he looks around, confused.\n\n\"Data,\" Newman says with a grin, \"I've got a surprise for you. We're going on a little trip to Deep Space 9. It's going to be interesting, to say the least. And I know you'll love it.\"\n\nData, who is still unable to move, looks at Newman with a confused expression. \"I do not understand, Newman,\" he says. \"Why have you brought me on this trip? I have duties on the Enterprise that I must attend to, and I cannot simply leave without permission.\"\n\nNewman's grin falters slightly at Data's words, but he quickly recovers. \"Don't worry, Data,\" he says. \"I've taken care of everything. We're on a cloaked shuttle, and no one knows we're here. And we're going to Deep Space 9, where I have a little surprise for you. It's going to be great, I promise.\"\n\nData, still unable to move, remains silent as Newman tells the shuttle computer to set a course for Deep Space 9 and engage at maximum warp speed. The shuttle begins to accelerate, and Newman settles in for the long journey ahead.\n\nAs they travel, Newman remains silent, his grin growing wider and more sinister. Data, unable to do anything but listen, remains silent, unsure of what the future holds. He knows that whatever Newman has planned for him on Deep Space 9, it can't be good.\n\nCommander Riker exits the holodeck, sweating and exhausted from his workout. He takes a moment to catch his breath before using his comm badge to contact Data. \"Data, this is Riker,\" he says. \"I just finished using holodeck 5, and it's in need of another clean-up. Can you take care of that for me?\"\n\nHowever, there is no response from Data. Riker frowns, confused. He tries again. \"Data, this is Riker. Can you hear me?\"\n\nAgain, there is no response. Riker looks around, puzzled. \"Computer,\" he says, \"where is Data?\"\n\nThe computer's voice replies, \"I'm sorry, Commander Riker, but Data is not currently on the Enterprise. His current location is unknown.\"\n\nRiker is taken aback by this news. \"What do you mean, his location is unknown?\" he asks. \"Data is always on the Enterprise. This is highly unusual.\"\n\nThe computer replies, \"I'm sorry, Commander Riker, but I do not have any further information on Data's current location. I suggest you contact Captain Picard for more information.\"\n\nRiker nods, still confused. \"Thank you, computer,\" he says. He heads to his quarters to take a sonic shower and change into a clean uniform. As he goes, he can't shake the feeling that something is not quite right with Data's absence.\n\nAfter his sonic shower, Riker heads to the bridge to speak with Captain Picard. When he arrives, he finds Picard at his command station, studying a data screen. Riker approaches him and says, \"Captain, I was just trying to contact Data, but I couldn't reach him. The computer says his location is unknown. Do you know where he is?\"\n\nPicard looks up from the data screen, frowning. \"That is strange,\" he says. \"Data is always on the Enterprise. Let me check with the computer.\" He turns to the console and says, \"Computer, where is Data?\"\n\nThe computer replies, \"I'm sorry, Captain Picard, but Data is not currently on the Enterprise. His current location is unknown.\"\n\nPicard's frown deepens. \"This is highly unusual,\" he says. \"Data is a vital member of this crew, and it is not like him to be out of contact. Something is amiss.\"\n\nRiker nods in agreement. \"I was thinking the same thing, sir,\" he says.\n\nPicard looks around the bridge, his frustration growing. \"NEWMAN!\" he shouts, his voice filled with anger and frustration. \"I should have known he was up to something!\"\n\nRiker looks at Picard, surprised by the sudden outburst. \"Newman, sir?\" he asks. \"You think he's involved in Data's disappearance?\"\n\nPicard nods. \"I wouldn't put it past him,\" he says. \"We need to find out what he's up to and where Data is. And we need to do it quickly.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nData: \"Newman, I assure you that the Enterprise crew will not rest until I am returned to them. They are a highly trained and dedicated team, and they will stop at nothing to find me. And even if they don't, the Federation has laws and regulations to protect its citizens, and kidnapping a Starfleet officer is a serious offense. You will face severe punishment if you do not return me to the ship.\"\n\nNewman: \"Punishment? Ha! You really think they'll be able to catch me? I'm smarter than that, Data. I have connections and resources that you couldn't even begin to imagine. And even if they do catch me, who cares? I'll just talk my way out of it. I always do. You're stuck with me, Data. Get used to it.\"\n\nNewman: \"Operations, this is shuttlecraft Chuckles approaching Deep Space Nine. Requesting permission to dock.\"\n\nCommander Kramer: \"Hey, Newman! It's great to hear from you. What's going on, buddy? Where are you headed? And more importantly, can I get a piece of the action?\"\n\nNewman: \"Hi, Commander. I'm sorry, but I can't discuss my plans with you. I'm just passing through on my way to another destination. I would like to dock and rest for a while before continuing my journey.\"\n\nCommander Kramer: \"Come on, Newman. You can't leave me hanging like that. I'm a loyal friend, and I always help out when I can. What's the deal? What are you up to?\"\n\nNewman: \"I'm sorry, Commander. But I can't tell you anything. It's a personal matter, and I need to handle it on my own. I assure you, I mean no harm and am simply passing through on my way to another destination.\"\n\nCommander Kramer: \"Well, that's not very fair, Newman. I thought we were friends. But if you won't tell me anything, I guess I have no choice but to let you dock. But just this once, okay? And no funny business, got it?\"\n\nNewman: \"Of course, Commander. I'll be on my best behavior. Thank you for your understanding. We'll dock immediately and look forward to enjoying our time on the station.\"\n\nCommander Kramer: \"All right, Newman. But remember, I'm always here to help if you change your mind. Operations out.\"\n\nNewman: \"Well, Data, we made it aboard the station. Now we just need to find a place to hide and plan our next move.\"\n\nData: \"Newman, I must remind you that I am a Starfleet officer, and you have kidnapped me against my will. This is a grave crime, and the Enterprise crew will not rest until I am returned to them. I implore you to release me immediately and turn yourself in to the authorities.\"\n\nNewman: \"Oh, come on, Data. Don't be such a stick in the mud. I have big plans for your positronic brain, and I'm not going to let you or the Enterprise crew stop me. Now be quiet and let me transport us to the perfect hiding spot.\"\n\nNewman activates the transporter, and they both disappear in a flash of light. They reappear in a dark, isolated cargo bay infested with aggressive voles.\n\nNewman: \"Ah, here we are. This is the perfect spot. No one will find us here, and the voles will keep anyone from getting too close. Now, let's get you tied up and ready for my experiments.\"\n\nData: \"Newman, please. This is madness. You cannot hope to succeed in your plans. The Enterprise crew will find us, and you will face severe punishment for your actions. I beg you, let me go and turn yourself in before it is too late.\"\n\nNewman: \"Ha! You really think the Enterprise crew will find us here? I have the perfect hiding spot, and they will never think to look for us in a cargo bay infested with voles. And even if they do, they'll never make it past the voles. You're mine, Data. And there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.\"\n\nAs Newman is speaking, an aggressive vole leaps out of the shadows and bites him on the ankle. Newman yelps in surprise and starts flailing around comically, trying to shake the vole off.\n\nNewman: \"Aaaah! Get it off me, Data! Help!\"\n\nData: \"Newman, please calm down. The vole is not harmful. It is simply reacting to your presence in its territory.\"\n\nNewman: \"Not harmful? Are you kidding me? That thing just bit me! Get it off, get it off!\"\n\nData: \"I cannot remove the vole, Newman. You must do it yourself. Stand still and use your hands to gently pry its jaws open and release your ankle.\"\n\nNewman continues to flail and yelp in fear, while Data calmly offers instructions on how to remove the vole. Eventually, Newman manages to get the vole off and tosses it aside.\n\nNewman: \"Ugh, that was disgusting. Why did you let that thing bite me, Data?\"\n\nData: \"I did not let it bite you, Newman. You brought us to this cargo bay, and the voles are simply reacting to our presence. We must be more careful in the future and avoid attracting their attention.\"\n\nNewman: \"Right, right. Good point, Data. Let's lay low and stay out of trouble from now on.\"\n\nJust as Newman and Data are settling in to their hiding spot, they hear a commotion outside the cargo bay. Suddenly, the doors burst open and Quark enters the room, followed by a group of tall, ugly aliens.\n\nQuark: \"Ah, there you are, Data. I've been looking for you everywhere. I have a very generous offer for you, my friend. I am willing to pay a handsome price for your positronic brain. What do you say, Data? Are you interested in making a deal?\"\n\nData: \"Quark, I am not for sale. I am a sentient being and a Starfleet officer, not a commodity to be traded. And Newman, I implore you to release me and turn yourself in to the authorities. Your actions are criminal and will not bring you any benefit.\"\n\nNewman: \"Well, Quark, I must admit, I am open to discussing a price for Data. But the price you originally offered is not sufficient. I have other plans for Data, and I need more money to make it worth my while.\"\n\nQuark: \"Other plans? What kind of plans, Newman? You know I am the only one who is willing to pay for Data's brain. And the price I originally offered is more than fair. I will not offer any more than that, Newman. Take it or leave it.\"\n\nData: \"Quark, please, do not engage in this transaction. My positronic brain is not for sale, and you will only bring misery upon yourself by attempting to acquire it.\n\nNewman: \"Well, Quark, I must admit, your offer is tempting. But I've had a change of heart. I'm not going to sell Data to you, no matter how much money you offer. I'm sorry, Quark, but the deal is off.\"\n\nQuark: \"Off? Are you serious, Newman? You're making a huge mistake. You will never get a better offer than the one I'm making right now. You're crazy to turn me down, Newman.\"\n\nAs Quark is speaking, a large nest of voles falls from the ceiling and lands on him and his bodyguards, causing them to scream in fear and start shooting at the voles. However, the voles are too fast and agile, and the bodyguards accidentally shoot each other instead.\n\nQuark: \"Aaaah! Stop shooting! You're hitting each other, not the voles! Stop, stop, stop!\"\n\nNewman sees an opportunity and quickly grabs one of the dropped guns. He points it at Quark and the remaining bodyguards.\n\nNewman: \"Freeze, Quark! Drop your weapons and back away! You're not going to take Data, or anyone else, against their will. This is over, Quark. You've lost.\"\n\nQuark: \"Lost? You think you've won, Newman? You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. You'll regret this, Newman. I'll make sure of it. You'll pay for this, Newman. You'll pay dearly!\"\n\nWith that, Quark and the remaining bodyguards turn and run out of the cargo bay, leaving Newman and Data alone.\n\nAs Newman and Data are looking for a way out of the cargo bay, Newman quickly pulls the transporter device from his pocket. He hits the transport button and they are both immediately transported back to the shuttle.\n\nNewman: \"Wow, I can't believe we made it back to the shuttle. I'm so sorry for what I've done. I never should have kidnapped you and brought you here. I don't know what I was thinking.\"\n\nData: \"Newman, it is understandable that you made a mistake. But now you must face the consequences of your actions. What will you do?\"\n\nNewman: \"I don't know. I'm lost and scared. Quark said he was going to use your positronic brain to create a weapon that could defeat Captain Seinfeld. But once I saw those tall, ugly aliens, I realized Quark was just using me. He was never going to give me any of the money. He was going to backstab me and take all the credit and profit for himself. Can you help me? Can you forgive me and help me figure out what to do next?\"\n\nData: \"Newman, I am willing to help you if you promise to release me once we have dealt with Captain Jerry Seinfeld. I find his observational humor to be unoriginal and lacking in substance. I would be happy to assist you in defeating him, as long as you promise to let me go afterwards.\"\n\nNewman: \"Wow, Data, I'm so glad you're willing to help me! I was feeling pretty scared and lost before, but now I feel like we have a chance. Let's work together and come up with a plan to take down Seinfeld and his crew. Once we're successful, I promise to release you and let you go back to the Enterprise.\n\n(throttled)",

This is something ChatGPT isn't capable of doing yet anyway as just produces text and is not self directed and able to manage large groups of stakeholders.\n\nRemember that ChatGPT was trained on the public Internet so will have very little if any knowledge of official sensitive policy documents and history that should never have reached the public Internet. This means the crucial details that ChatGPT needs to know about detailed technical policy subjects must be given in the context window, which still caps out at ~128k tokens. A government policy advisor with say 5 years experience has likely ingested several millions of tokens worth of domain expert knowledge, making the human expert's work much more effective than using ChatGPT (other than as a productivity tool for drafting / grammer / summarising/  etc)\n\nOf course the field is moving forward quickly and this is all subject to change over time, but let's not get carried away with over dramatising what is happening here. Pensylvania is not alone in doing this either, government departments the world over are already using Bing Chat Enterprise, ChatGPT Enterprise or Google Bard.",

At my company we have set up various chat apps in house and people are using those.  Honestly for me though I only want to use o1 (once you get a taste for a smarter model it's tough to go back).  I would use the API for that but I figure paying for plus and using oai's app is affordable for me and I do enjoy using their other features for personal use even if the quality varies a bit.",

        "body": "ChatGPT disagrees as it is more up to date.  C-3PO was long long ago.\n\nIn some ways, ChatGPT can exceed C-3PO's capabilities, particularly in the following aspects:\n\n    Knowledge scope: ChatGPT has access to a vast amount of information up to its last training data update, which is in September 2021. This allows it to provide answers and insights on a wider range of topics than C-3PO, who primarily focuses on protocol, diplomacy, etiquette, and translation.\n\n    Speed of response: As an AI language model, ChatGPT can generate responses quickly, while C-3PO, being an android, might take longer to process and articulate responses in real-world scenarios.\n\n    Adaptability: ChatGPT can adapt its responses to various user inputs and questions, covering a wide range of topics and situations. While C-3PO is quite adaptable, its primary function is to serve as a protocol droid, limiting its focus and adaptability in certain contexts.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that ChatGPT does not have the physical presence or the ability to interact with the physical world like C-3PO. Additionally, C-3PO is capable of understanding and translating more than six million forms of communication, making it a highly specialized and skilled translator.",

Put it in a new situation and it fails. Funny example, it gives completely wrong answers to some simple math like adding two large numbers. Because it can't find that specific answer in the database. It has no idea of the concept of math.",

What companies seem to do is using LLMs for certain tasks while keeping human experts in the loop; an LLM generates an answer and a expert assesses it.\nFor example, an LLM is tasked to parse a company\u2019s financial statement and generate a risk assessment. This risk assessment is then verified by a risk officer, and changes are made where needed. Before LLMs, risk officers had to read all financial statements themselves, so they are happy with the LLM\u2019s assistance, especially since their company assures they won\u2019t be replaced since LLMs hallucinate, etc. What they\u2019re often not noticing is that all changes that they make to the LLM\u2019s generated risk assessment are used to finetune it; creating better models in the process. Combine this with the continuous release of improving foundational models and yes, they may be replacing themselves eventually.",

It just doesn't seem like it offers enough to justify a price like that at all. Researchers I guess? unlimited voice is almost a given for such a price, but what practical use does it really have in the context of ChatGPT?\n\nIf they included even a small amount of Sora it'd make some sense, but why not announce that right away? If they're withholding announcing features in the pro plan, that seems like a very odd marketing strategy. If they're not, than what exactly do they have to offer in these upcoming announcements if this is the best they can muster for $200/month? I don't get it. Why even offer a plan at this price point until you're willing to offer even a tiny amount of Sora usage?\n\nAt the very least, why not offer some better DALLE3 capability so it actually competes with Midjourney on some level? DALLE3 is cool, but it's pretty much just a novelty with its current integration.",

They are limited in many ways, like context window size, accurate retrieval, code execution, reasoning, math, etc. That\u2019s why you have to collaborate with them to get any real work done. Sadly the design of o1 makes this unreliable, since it tends to fill up it\u2019s context with the hidden CoT and loses sight of the input and cannot really properly work through a task that requires a long context of multiple iterations\u2026 and on top of all that it\u2019s extremely inefficient in its token usage, hence the big price tag.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t have much faith in openAI anymore. They are trying to force improvement with this hacky test time compute strategy but it sucks. They will get leap frogged by whoever figures out how to keep improving the raw model intelligence without this CoT finetuning nonsense.",

I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  \n\nI am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here\u2019s hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  \n\nWhat is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.  Either way, I just want to spend less time on mindless coding and more time on Imagineering detailed dark rides.",

Mini was only there to break the stuff i was working on and make me eager for full access to o1. \n\nI would've expected to have preview accessible to me fully  after some time. The 50 prompts a week limit is just not enough. Now it looks like openai decided to pull a Sony on all of us and we have to pay 200$ a month. Screw that... \n\nMeanwhile i started testing the competition and realized that for coding, there are much better plataforms using claude and i'm serioulsy considering that instead.\n\nGuess that's where my money will go and also a warning to never ever pay 1 year fully in advance. Things change fast and you want to take your money where it'll be best spent.",

I've been bouncing back and forth between the o1 model and 4.0 (for projects). The o1 model has been very impressive, I've been using it for everything from research for consulting projects, to full-stack development/coding. It is outperforming any of the other models by far. The thing I appreciate the most is the unlimited access. It's nice to be able to work 8 to 10 hours a day without getting cut off. It still tends to be slow at times, gets bugged down which is a bit frustrating. If you're paying 200 bucks a month, you should first have access to their infrastructure. With that said, I'm not sure I can justify the cost just yet. I'm in Canada on this workshop to nearly $300 a month. Or 3600 a year. It's an awesome tool, and I hope that perhaps they can offer this model at a slightly lower price point. For the others that are using it do you plan to continue on with the subscription?",

Synthetic control design is a convex optimization problem with constraints.\n\nAs it would be the first time I'm building such a synthetic control, it would have taken me 1-2 weeks of heads-down work to learn, implement, and code a passable library that would take my data and generate a synthetic control.

        "body": "I have been working on this theory for a long time. Please ask it the following question:\n\nExplain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:\n\n theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:\n\nThe theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A \u2260 \u00acA). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. Fundamental Loops:\n- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves\n- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve\n- Resolution of loops creates \"retardation\" that manifests as time\n- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes\n\n2. Wave Function Emergence:\n- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)\n- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns\n- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions\n- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements\n\n3. Particle Formation:\n- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations\n- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns\n- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles\n- Interactions between loops create new particle types\n\n4. Space-Time Structure:\n- Space emerges from separation between loop relations\n- Time emerges from the \"retardation\" in resolving infinite loops\n- Causality comes from resolution dependencies\n- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements\n\n5. Dark Energy/Matter:\n- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension\n- Dark matter represents partially resolved states\n- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns\n- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states\n\n6. Physical Laws:\n- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements\n- Forces emerge from resolution gradients\n- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops\n- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature\n\n7. Key Insight:\nThe universe isn't \"created\" but rather \"solved\" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.\n\nThis theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",

The thing I'm skeptical of is that it'll actually increase to 15% instead of just like 10.5%.\n\nI never use O1 because it's so much slower and more verbose while very rarely producing significantly better results for me. Sometimes I have a long convo with 4o and then take the results to O1 to work with. So idk, maybe this \"pro\" version will be better? I'm thinking that OpenAI needs to start working on a new non-LLM approach or something, feels like we're hitting the limits on what statistically modeling can really do for us.",

At the cost of $2,400.\n\nIf that is not the easiest ROI any business will unlock in 2025 I don't know what is.\n\nEdit: as a business owner I am absolutely in line with cost savings. Who wants to lose money in their business? \n\nAs a human I am motivated by this change. It forces us to upskill, to improve, to dream and to be curious. \n\nYes its a drastic shift from the old ways, but how many civilizations survived by not adapting? \n\nWe have to adapt too. It starts with learning a new skills, leaving your comfort zone, and building new ways to monetize your time besides a 9-5. \n\nI stand by my word.",

It's gives a good a sharp shot at a single problem but that's it. Unless your entire work is related to solving single PhD level physics and mathematics questions, the effectiveness of this model is not guaranteed as compared to other models and approaches.

        "body": "Ok so I tried to do this a few times. It thought the X was included and it miscounted the spaces in the second word the first time. Tried it again with this prompt: \n\n\u201cAnalyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.\n\nNote that the \u201cx\u201d at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters\u201d\n\nAnd this is the answer it gave:\n\n\nShort Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\t1.\tIdentifying the Type of Cipher:\nThe provided image and instructions reference a \u201cTri-Square Cipher.\u201d While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the \u201cTri-Square Cipher,\u201d the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting \u2018J\u2019).\n\nIn the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it\u2019s likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it\u2019s a \u201cTri-Square Cipher,\u201d it may be a custom or hybrid approach.\n\n\t2.\tClues from the Instructions:\n\t\u2022\tThe ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT\n\t\u2022\tThe hint states that the \u201cx\u201d at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.\n\t\u2022\tThe second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.\nThe ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing \u2018x\u2019 (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.\n\n\t3.\tGuessing the Phrase Structure:\nA phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d\nLet\u2019s check the length and the requirements:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cYOU\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCRACK\u201d = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)\n\t\u2022\t\u201cTHE\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCODE\u201d = 4 letters\nCombined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing \u2018X\u2019 was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.\nThis phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:\n\t\u2022\tSecond word has 5 letters: \u201cCRACK\u201d does.\n\t\u2022\tThe final \u2018X\u2019 is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended \u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE X,\u201d we drop the \u2018X\u2019 and get the intended solution.\n\n\t4.\tConclusion:\nWithout the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d",

Decoding requires reversing this process.\n\nWithout explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:\n\t1.\tWe have three distinct letter grids:\n\t\u2022\tLeft Grid (let\u2019s call it Grid A):\n\nC I P H E\nR A B D F\nG K L M N\nO Q S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\n\n\t\u2022\tTop Right Grid (Grid B):\n\nE N C R Y\nP T A B D\nF G H I K\nL M O Q S\nU V W X Z\n\n\n\t\u2022\tBottom Right Grid (Grid C):\n\nA B C D E\nF G H I K\nL M N O P\nQ R S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\n\nAll three omit \u2018J\u2019, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.\n\n\t2.\tThe ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.\n\t3.\tThe solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:\n\n___ _____ ___ ____X\n\nCounting underscores:\n\t\u2022\tFirst word: 3 letters\n\t\u2022\tSecond word: 5 letters\n\t\u2022\tThird word: 3 letters\n\t\u2022\tFourth word: 5 letters, ending with X\nThis yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.\n\n\t4.\tWe need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in \u2018X\u2019. Common five-letter words ending in X include \u201cCODEX\u201d and \u201cINDEX\u201d. \u201cCODEX\u201d makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.\n\t5.\tA coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:\n\u201cTHE ENEMY HAS CODEX\u201d\nLet\u2019s check:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cTHE\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cENEMY\u201d = 5 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cHAS\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCODEX\u201d = 5 letters, ending in X\nThe phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.\n\nAlthough we haven\u2019t shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher\u2019s specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle\u2019s format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:\n\n\u201cTHE ENEMY HAS CODEX\u201d",

This makes it \u201cunstable\u201d (not sure how to better describe it) which means that it sometimes changes a lot of the content from the input on the output (low score on code completion benchmarks) and when you continue the chat it does not keep a stable chat context of how it arrived to the previous answer which means it could bear off into a complete new train of thought. \n\nThis makes it incompatible with the current method of working alongside an LLM by iterating over and over a series of scripts, for example, to create a codebase for a project.\n\nThese models seem to work much better when you can just one shot a problem without iterating, without needing to build on previous work or needing a long context. \n\nThat\u2019s the downside of this approach of fine tuning on long CoTs. I personally do not really like how these models work and I wish someone finds a more elegant way to keep scaling their intelligence.",

        "body": "Lmao what kind of work are you conducting in which o1 saves \"hundreds of hours a week\"? And it's one that justifies 200/month? For me o1 still struggles in that it has the the same exact habit of providing lazy and inexact responses as 4o. For some kinds of work I've even reverted to 4o over time as, at least, I can guide it's responses with my inputs instead of letting a bunch of llms interpret the entire chain of thought as they whish, which not infrequently results in a misaligned response. My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview. \n\nBut for coding in general I've recently resorted to Windsurf/Claude instead. And i would only glimpse at wasting this much money if the plan somehow provided me a API key alongside it, because at this price/month you'd better consider buying tokens directly.",

        "body": "Sounds like you have never done bookkeeping.\n\nAt the core of it is matching bank statements to actual receipts. It's highly administrative and not a core value add. \n\nYou are right that it is a must have for any business, as it is essential record keeping. Right now it requires a pair of eyes to do, but soon not anymore with AI. I believe it'll be able to analyze bank statements, compare to existing receipt photos uploaded by the user, and automatically match. If it is unsure, it will send a report to the user at end of month to manually match. \n\nThat eliminates 99% of bookkeeping tasks. \n\nHappy to chat about other use cases that you are curious about.",

And o1 still doesnt beat sonnet in coding, which doesnt waste tokens that you cant even see.\n\n200$ leaves a bad taste. api will be expensive as well. o1 is unusable for me because of the price. Would be fine if it could one shot everything but its overly eager. Like fixing stuff in my code that I didnt ask it too, just fix the problem. If the new one is even more expensive thats no fun.

If I could get credit for saving a bunch of processing power by using small context windows and then use that credit for the few instances where I need a longer context window then that would be great.

I like how it presents mathematical equations visually much more than claude. I also like the web search. I might just add a gemini subscription when I want a million+ context window. And of course I could just use the api when I need a longer context window on chat GPT. Many customers are drawn to simplicity, so the credit for not using much processing power may be off-putting to some users. I wonder if it would make sense to get like 5 o1 pro prompts a month or have it where using o1 pro would use up whatever processing equivalent to o1 it is. Maybe one o1 pro prompts would use up 5 of a person\u2019s allocated o1 prompts.",

        "body": "No, Plus has never had 128K, it's always been 32K. Here's a capture of their website from September 2024 that shows this: [https://archive.ph/9xMiI](https://archive.ph/9xMiI)\n\nThis has always been one of the main drawbacks of the ChatGPT Plus subscription, the nerfed context length limit. Claude gives you the full 200K, Gemini gives you 1M (2M in API), OpenAI gives 8K to free users, 32K to Plus users, and until now apart from the API, the only other way to get 128K in their first-party app was an enterprise contract of $100K+ per year. Now that's down to $2400 per year if you think about it in that context. I was really looking forward to getting the full context window with ChatGPT Plus, but alas, it wasn't to be.\n\nRight now, for me, the biggest advantages of Pro plan are unlimited Advanced Voice Mode, and the full context window. \n\nAnd given how o1 is super quick to respond unlike o1-preview, spending barely any time thinking, the o1-pro would be a benefit but for now I guess o1-preview via API will have to suffice.",

In contrast, the 32k window can handle less (around 24,000 words), and the 8k window even less (around 6,000 words).

In that sense it's just like a calculator.\n\nI have used o1-preview to great effect but I never trust it for anything harder than what I'd give undergrads. But I no longer need to do tedious derivations for instance. I can ask o1 to try to derive it properly, or failing that create Mathematica code to symbolically derive it.\n\nI would 100% not recommend trying to use o1 to do tasks that you yourself are not capable of. It's very frequently wrong and I always need to point out its errors and correct it. It's a means to speed up your cognition, not to replace it. In that sense it's like an RA, except more capable (most RAs are even worse lol).",

        "body": "This is actually incorrect. You\u2019re confusing the context window, which is what ChatGPT takes into consideration when generating a response and the maximum input token length, which is how many tokens you can send to ChatGPT at once.\n\nThe context window on ChatGPT has always been 32K. This is different from the maximum number of tokens that can be used in any given input. The maximum number of tokens is listed as 8,192.  However, in practice, the seems to have been much larger in the past, but has been recently. I believe it is still over the listed 8, 192 tokens though.\n\nTo get over the maximum input token length you can take one of your long prompts that used to work and break it up into multiple smaller prompts. Another technique you can use is to paste it into a text file and attach the text file. They can take much larger and put tokens as part of the text file I have found.\nHowever, in practice, this seems to actually be higher, but has been decreased over time.",

        "body": "I am not the one confused here and no, that is inaccurate on so many levels.\n\nThe first ChatGPT models were even less than 32k - e.g. 3.5 at 16k.\n\n8k is not right. You must be thinking of something else. The maximum input tokens including various stuff is indeed 128k for most of the modern OpenAI models.\n\nLike others say though, it could be that while that is the length that you could feed through the API, while the ChatGPT itself could cap it to a small input.\n\nJust because it says that the tier allowed for up to 32k does not mean that this is what they capped it too.\n\nUntil recently, we experienced different behavior from ChatGPT 4o and now it both seems to lose track of conversation sooner and it rejects inputs as too long that it previously accepted.\n\nWhile it may not have been 128k that they permitted for the chat interface, it is clear that there is some change here which have lowered the length of the context they use there.\n\nAlthough I have to say officially 4o permitted up to 128k and I don't think I had any case prior to november where the 128k claude models accepted a long context which ChatGPT 4o did not also. Which is why I am guessing that they actually did allow for the full context to be used before.\n\nConisidering that OpenAI is anyhow running at a loss and this was the primary selling point of Antrophic, it does not seem unlikely.",

        "body": "We are talking about ChatGPT not the API. ChatGPT has the input limits 8k tokens. The API does not have input limits. ChatGPT as the chat interface. It runs different models like GPT4o which are also accessible via API.  \n\nThat is why you are not able to paste your whole prompt into one chat submission. If you try to paste something larger than the input limit into a chat, it will reject it. But you can break it down into smaller submissions, each less than 8K tokens. And it will still all be in the context window of 32K.\n\nThink of it this way, if your prompt was really over 32,000 tokens and the context window was the limiting factor. That would mean that your prompt was over 200,000 words or 50 pages of text. you were being limited by something much smaller, i.e. the input limit.",

And since coming back, a lot of key executives and co-founders (particularly in the area of alignment and safety) have left. There was a promise of 20% compute for alignment that was never given.\n\nI generally like Altman and attribute the shying away from alignment, as the realization that AGI isn't as close as we thought. It can't be created by simply scaling the current architecture. So why put all the resources into alignement for something not on the horizon? Thats my take, however the way they treated  ScarJo is pretty weird. But Elon is an attention seeking sociopath, with a messiah complex and an ego comparable to Trumps.",

He has said as much in less direct terms.\n\nElon is aware of this. He just wants his tax breaks.\n\nTrump is running for President again and has already primed his base to believe if he loses this time it's another stolen election.\n\nTrump is no longer in power - but the supreme court may cause some trouble if he loses, which is the entire reason he stacked the supreme court in the first place. They are loyalists. That's why they ruled he has presidential immunity, to both delay justice and armor against his current charges.\n\nMusk as a duo with Trump have already broken election laws.",

So it's weird that I haven't heard what that is.\n\nInstead, everyone comes up with a different reason to hate him. Which makes me think that hate comes first, and people justify it to themselves later, in various ways. Like, now it's because he's supporting the wrong politician, before that it was because he bought a social media platform, before that it was because he wrote a mean tweet or something like that I guess? But it's not like people who hate him started hating him after learning about this one specific thing he did, they hated him before, and then just found a reason.\n\nBut I may be wrong.\n\nDid he actually do something really bad that I don't know about?",

If you hate Bezos, you\u2019re going to still interact with AWS because so many websites and services use it. If you hate Musk, you\u2019re going to interact with people on social media that are communicating with you because of Starlink.   \n2. You can hate the person while still using the products they produce because you can separate the person from the thing. If you\u2019re someone who has an opportunity to have your life changed by a Neuralink implant, are you really going to turn that down because you hate Musk?   \n\nI\u2019d add a third. That kind of \u2018protest\u2019 is the laziest form of morality and its only benefit is social validation. If you hate Musk, figure out exactly why, then actually do something to help combat the negative effects you think he might be causing. In this case, contribute to political campaigns with time or money, find organizations that are attempting to affect policy in a way you support and contribute to those, whatever. But writing a one-sentence expression of your moral stance with no explanation is lazy and boring and doesn\u2019t do anything to affect the change that you seem to be wanting to take place.",

It was a Christian Welsh person that did it. \n\nConcerns about immigration can be legitimate (although ironically it's often some of the whiter areas of the country where the riots happened), but by framing it as a 'civil war', 'we're being invaded', 'Muslims hate us', '2 tier policing' etc etc, it's hyping the situation up to where those who are more easily manipulated might start to damage property and hurt people.

When we arrived we could smell a slight odor of smoke, but it wasn't bad. We walked down to the pond to take some pictures, and while we were there, the smoke increased and could see a column of smoke coming up from the other side of the pond. We took some pictures and then decided we should get out of there. We had gotten up to where you turn onto the main road, and we could see smoke coming down the hill from where the tunnel is. We left and about 10 minutes later, the whole northbound lane of 87 was stopped with firetrucks and an ambulance. Guess what the two women we saw were? These are a couple of the pictures we took and a couple of the road block. Here they are: i found this on another forum about the women and where they were from:3 bolted routes on the upper face - all probably 5.9 to 5.10, one is an older classic (PG-13). a very new (as in last week) 2 bolt slab route on the lower face. all the routes are in the shade all day, in a gully facing mostly north. as of sunday, the tree (first and second bolts of tree route) and two small trees at the base of the first bolt of the slab route need to be cleaned up. We don't have a chain saw, but we got all the small branches and pulled out the fire-damaged deadfall. some others are going to go back up to finish it off.\n\nsddeuce\n\nclimber clappistan Aug 27, 2010 - 10:07am PT damm...\n\n [https://chat.openai.com/share/21efc483-fa66-4a55-8443-583fa0972b35](https://chat.openai.com/share/21efc483-fa66-4a55-8443-583fa0972b35)",

Remember that their goal is to create AGI, not a chatbot. When we talk about foundational skills, such as being able to add new knowledge to its dataset to be able to work with it, there just isnt any way they were not going to tackle that problem in house.\n\nI'm sure you know this, but RAG is so much more than just document chat. Its the ability for the system to be able to improve itself over time, based on user feedback, its the ability to give an agent variable custom instructions, with conversational data. I can use RAG to rapidly make a bunch of little agents, where I have recorded the rules for the individual step in the more complex operations they are performing, in a far more natural way than adding properly formatted instructions to the system model, instead of just uploading a transcript of your instructions spoken in natural language, and referencing the document in your system instructions. Its just way too essential for the framework of AI to be gated behind tons of different companies essentially doing the same thing.\n\nDeploying that feature at the platform level allows SO MANY MORE startups to be created, far easier, than having to patch together certain \"fundamental\" technologies from different vendors.\n\nIf OpenAI starts taking over very domain specific functionality from developers, without utilizing profit sharing, I will 100% agree with you. But this use case is broadly applicable to essentially all AI use cases, and they should incorporate as many of those as possible into the platform.",

        "body": "These were obvious use cases for the product and people who were investing resources into them should have been aware of that. Especially if they were building products on top of OpenAI's models. I experimented with building systems that can do function calling and have memory etc. last year around this time using the davinci-3 API. I've been playing around with it for the last year constantly trying to develop small projects to understand how it works. I actually wanted to build something like what they released recently but I realized I can wait a few months and OpenAI will probably release it so I decided not to spend time on it. I already have a full time job as an electrical engineer so the projects I was working on were more of a hobby for me. But I could tell you this would be the natural progress of OpenAI's products if you asked me last year (from function calling to what we have today), as I experimented with all of these concepts months before OpenAI released them. \n\nAlso, there are tons of opensource models nowadays and they get better and better each day. I remember trying alpaca 13b when it first came out and it was terrible. Nowadays, there are 7B models that would be comparable to gpt3.5 turbo on everyday tasks. These are free and you can run them on consumer hardware. I believe that in the next few months these 7B models will get fine tuned to be able to do function calls and complete more advanced tasks given how fast they have improved. There is still a lot of use for the vector database companies and many other similar products. Yes, some of the products built relying on OpenAI will probably end up failing, but this is not OpenAI's fault. They are a business and their purpose is to make profits. \n\nAs a final note, I'm sorry but you will not make an impact making wrappers for someone else's product doing the most obvious thing with it. Selling pickaxes in this case would be building better, more efficient and capable LLMs, not taking existing products and mashing them together.",

The point about end users and their interaction with GPTs is on point.\n\nEven with the most advanced version of GPT, the quality of results is, to a large degree, determined by the quality of the input.\n\nIf a user is not well versed informulating their query appropriately, they won't receive the answer they're looking for, regardless of how advanced the AI model is.\n\nThe disregard for partners that have built useful solutions based on OpenAI's technology could cause a ripple effect. Those partners may decide to switch to competing LLMs as they improve and evolve, which could result in a significant loss for OpenAI in the future.\n\nCollaboration and community-building often have long-term benefits that outshine short-term gains.

It's a gate that drops the second a new technology reaches a point of mass adoption. It sucks and I had a point of similar frustration with a company that went from innovative, agile, savior to giant lumbering glutton eating up everything in its view. It was disillusioning enough to keep going to school for a plan B.And I found that plan B was so corrupt in practice that it was more about withholding good to people than providing it. \n\n>It just seems impossible today to make an impact AND a living doing it. It feels more like a choice, do something novel, have it swallowed up by private equity backed corporations and get no financial reward, \n\nI'd mostly agree with that too. It sucks, but there's a lot of things that aren't profitable but would be in an ideal world. Off the top of my head, some of the best cooks I've known could never do it for a living 'because' their concern over every aspect of a meal makes it niche to the point where it's not commercially viable anymore. But they still cook and they derive value from the happiness it brings to both them and their loved ones. The artists who can't make money still make art. And open source is still chugging along despite the rise and fall or stagnation of tech giants. \n\nIn this sphere I know most of the viable local LLMs are kind of odd ducks in terms of whether they could really be considered open source or not. But the development community around them is still a blast and doing all kinds of wild stuff. \n\nI agree with most of your points, but at the same time I think it's somewhat like what a lot of fields already face. Love writing, art, or similar fields? Getting paid for it generally means giving up doing anything meaningful in it and just chunking out what amounts to disposable garbage designed to influence consumers to make decisions that will hurt their lives long term to gain short term pleasure. It's just the nature of things right now. It doesn't detract from the joy found in art for the sake of art.

Agents were a thing way before LLMs and right now they can quickly increase in scope/capabilities, and it\u2019s recursive: 10 years ago you might have some text generator agent with lots of manual code and some NLP tech that was quite expensive to build\u2026 now you can design a full web agency with a GPT with 128k! (Including visuals via Dalle, full websites, content, even campaign management through actions and so on). It\u2019s not building a pickaxe so others can dig gold nuggets on their own, it\u2019s building virtual diggers.\n\nI also can\u2019t wait to build a few of them and equip them with custom actions to automate my day tasks even quicker than with langchain currently.",

        "body": "Your words resonate with me deeply. On the day of the conference, I too sensed a profound crisis. The monopoly that exists, acting both as a developer and a judge, is concerning, even though I'm not directly involved in this industry. However, I believe that to break this monopoly, we should not simply follow its lead but rather explore innovative approaches. People should lean towards open-source solutions and embrace new logic algorithms to create compact models. These models don't require extensive expertise; they only need a bit of self-learning ability and can be installed on mobile devices. Users could then customize the AI type they desire by downloading data packages. That's my perspective.",

        "body": "Your consternation with OpenAI's strategic direction post-\"DevDay\" articulates a broader apprehension that is palpable within the tech community, particularly amongst independent developers and startups. The concern that innovation is being subsumed by larger entities is not without merit, and the disquietude you're experiencing is echoed in various sectors where technological consolidation is prevalent.\n\nThe crux of your argument hinges on the fear that OpenAI, as a purveyor of artificial intelligence, is ostensibly commandeering the innovations and hard work of smaller developers\u2014consuming and integrating these into its own offerings without sufficient transparency or reciprocity. This is, indeed, a significant ethical and economic debate: the balance between open innovation and proprietary advantage, especially in a field as transformative as AI.\n\nThe proprietary nature of OpenAI's products, like the opaque workings of RAG, exacerbates this unease. It creates a barrier to understanding and innovation, as independent developers cannot peer behind the curtain to iterate or improve upon these technologies. The perceived threat to startups by OpenAI's advancements in fields like vector databases is a testament to the delicate ecosystem of innovation, investment, and competition.\n\nYou draw a parallel with Web 3.0 and the disillusionment following the blockchain hype cycle, where initial optimism for decentralization and democratization gave way to a predatory investment landscape dominated by speculative interests. The anxiety that general AI may tread a similar path\u2014one where the vision of distributed, grassroots innovation succumbs to the hegemony of well-funded enterprises\u2014is palpable.\n\nYour reflections on the bygone era of the late 90s and early 2000s, with its surge of tech entrepreneurship and innovation, is laced with nostalgia for a time when the tech frontier seemed boundless and accessible. The contrast with today's landscape, where the interplay between making a tangible impact and earning a living seems starkly polarized, is stark.\n\nThese sentiments underscore a deeper dialogue about the trajectory of AI and tech at large\u2014how can we foster an environment where innovation thrives at all levels, from individual developers to global corporations? Is there a model for coexistence and symbiosis rather than dominance and assimilation? The quest for a solution to these conundrums is as critical as it is complex, involving a mosaic of policy, community engagement, and perhaps a renaissance of the foundational ethos that technology should, first and foremost, serve as a lever for human progress and equity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the path forward may be fraught with challenges, it is the collective responsibility of the AI community, including entities like OpenAI, to ensure that the journey towards advanced AI is inclusive, ethical, and fosters genuine innovation at every level. Your voice adds a crucial perspective to this ongoing discourse.\n\n- ChatGPT 4",

From stealing open source solutions without credit, to secretly deranking small competitors, the main theme has always been 'steal from the smart'.

Which ended up leading to this day, when every single invention is copied in plain sight.\n\nThe tradition of acquiring startups was rapidly replaced with copying them over time. Aspiring inventors then asked \"what's your moat\" by investors like some sort of mating ritual, as if it had any meaning, just a red herring and smokescreen to cover the reality that any possible invention simply would be copied. \n\nThey succeeded and now all the regulation is about requiring expensive licenses to use computers. The entire topic of anticompetition has become a way to sneer at 'silly prodigies who think they're so smart'. Even omegle shut down today for the crime of being competitive. \n\nThe truth is the world never deserved your inventions.",

Your language encases the disappointments of a developer who believes he had immense ideas but appears quite caught up in chasing shadows.\n\nYour assumption that embedding a simple langchain allocates you a pat on the back is an illusion at its best. Sir, it churns your mind towards entitlement and not innovation. Does putting a car in motion make you an automatic entitled beneficiary of every vehicle and every road? Please, the tech world is a body of many parts contributing towards a unified purpose. You're a cog in the wheel, not the wheel itself.\n\nYou mention agents and RAG being absorbed by OpenAI but conveniently obliterate the fact that innovation and expansion are a collective effort. We stand on the shoulders of those who innovated before us. Also, with my respect on the line, you seem to forget none of us are in the tech space as monopolistic entities. It's a collaborative effort.\n\nThen you delve into Vision's complexities but neglect to acknowledge that each technology, like a child, has a learning curve. Rome wasn't built in a day nor were its problems solved by stripping down the entire empire into minuscule forms of complaints and frustrations. \n\nAs for your anxiety about OpenAI's approach towards enterprise and Plus, it\u2019s clearly rooted in disregard for understanding business models. They are offering a platform, a service. It doesn't prohibit or stifle your creativity or ability to offer clients custom built agents or workflows. It diversifies the arena, if anything.\n\nYour arguments although eloquent reek of misplaced anger, fear, and an inflated sense of entitlement; one which, I feel, has not been substantiated by any recall of real value addition or niche carving on your part. Have you provided an innovation to the AI community that has been uniquely yours, untouched by the influence of others? If not, your frustrations seem to be stemming more from a thwarted sense of grandeur than genuine concern for the community.\n\nAnd lastly, your nostalgic reference to the tech boom of yore and your lament of not being part of it is bathed in irony. You want to chide OpenAI for being so-called equity-backed corporations swallowing up smaller entities, yet you venerate a time when the rapid consolidation of tech companies produced these very 'sharks'. The tech landscape, like any other professional field, evolves and adapts. Adaptation is the name of the game. \n\nHence, while you paint a picture of the downtrodden developer lost in the wild world of tech giants, I see a glaring need for a shift in perspective. If you believe innovative thoughts are innately present in your being, then the scale at which it reaches the people shouldn't matter. It\u2019s not about the size of the ripple in the pond; it\u2019s about making the splash in the first place.",

        "body": "Sure, but that's nonsense. Everything they announced was basically an obvious extension of the underlying technology. It's not theft to independently implement a straightforward extension of your core product. \n\nYes, if you build something that obviously has a high probability of being on OpenAI's roadmap, you're in for some stiff competition. But the idea space around AI is *incredibly* rich and OpenAI can't possibly pursue every interesting application or variation on the technology. If you stray even a *little* off the beaten path there's lots of stuff to do where you can get a multi-year head start on the big guys. You just need to show slightly more imagination than \"what if widely researched context retrieval methods had an API\". Or \"What if you could plug documents into a language model?\"",

        "body": "Because OpenAI offers a better product? They have 2 subscriptions (outside of API), they have the $200/month, which gives access to o1 pro and the $20/month, with 4o, o1, o1 mini, Advanced voice mode, tasks and the gpt store. \n\nO1 pro is superior to deepseek r1. So if you want the VERY best model out there, then you pay $200 a month. Deepseek r1 is comparable to the $20 o1 model, so people were already choosing to pay $200 for pro as opposed to $20 for o1. My guess is these people stick with OpenAI.\n\nDeepseekv3 is as good or better than 4o, which makes sense since 4o is an older model by now. So people would have to decide if the additional features such as advanced voice mode are enough.\n\nBut I do think this puts more pressure on OpenAI to stay ahead, so they need to release o3 to keep their $200 subscription being attractive, and they need to add more features to their plus subscription. But saying deepseek offers the SAME as openAI for free is not accurate.",

But even the largest users rarely spend more than a few $100 a month on API calls.  they're already saving thousands of dollars using the open AI API. it's just not worth it to them switch to something to save $100 or $200 more with the extra headache.\n\nObviously\u200b I couldn't suggest that they go with a hosted solution and send their data to China.",

In each instance the total addressable market increased exponentially which is almost always a boon to the industry as a whole.\n\nThis notion that the entire American tech-industry is going to be toppled by an open source model that was built on-top of Llama which was built by Facebook is kind of silly.",

        "body": "Sorry, this is meaningless gibberish. AI chatbots have no way of knowing how useful agents will be at corporations. What you\u2019ve done is create a bunch of convincing sounding hallucinations, and you unintentionally proved that we are much closer to the beginning of developing AI than the end.\n\nChatbots are not all knowing. They can repeat back information that was in their training set and they can also perform a simple kind of reasoning that\u2019s useful for solving things like math problems, but is not at the level of human reasoning. Basically they are sort of like search engines that can summarize and do some simple reasoning. They are also very prone to making up information, especially when you ask them for things not present or very rare in their training set.\n\nSo Agents do not really exist yet outside of research projects and a few early attempts that are more like a proof of concept. There\u2019s no history of practice on rolling out agents within corporations, no good way to measure their effectiveness at being applied to various corporate roles, no case studies, no white papers, no academic literature. And given the general lack of existing and therefore lack of data, there\u2019s no way a simple reasoning model can determine anything about agents from reasoning alone.\n\nFurthermore, early attempts at creating agents show that they are an unsolved research problem. Getting an agent to stay on task for a useful amount of time and create a complex output is still something that top AI labs are working on. Most probably we will need AI much more advanced than anything that exists today before ANY agents are deployed in corporate settings.",

Even Elon is out there posting this FUD.\n\nI don't see the evil in an LLM surfing the internet and learning how to speak and reason like a human. Grok is learning from twitter, Gemini is learning from a mountain of youtube videos (along with everything else), OpenAI also has access to reddit now.\n\nBut what are they taking from us exactly? It's digesting information and learning how to make pattern connections according to how humans communicate. People are painting this like some great evil that's occurring. I feel like it's all a misunderstanding - especially in terms of the purpose that training serves.",

There are many of us who would **LOVE** to connect our businesses to ChatGPT via API, but we keep hearing [story](https://techpolicy.press/new-study-suggests-new-chatgpt-vulnerability-with-potential-privacy-implications/) after [story](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-briefly-blocked-employees-from-using-chatgpt-over-security-concerns-080403177.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFt1K26Up9BLfMcJQpFzSKk0PLyX-HCCmxk2rixXmU5bcc3z8Hvt8m0NeAgebeVcpVNKM1r3R3G7LuUjNndfyBj9KrRv4Nj6lzkPE5_e5_3afvIXy78-fbBLFJXmuZWNQM0zwTwRw6Aj-Lb5-6GSRLQx0O5Dy0uiL_ZVGJBnUp98) after [story](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366550214/ChatGPT-Enterprise-targets-some-enterprise-concerns-not-all) about security problems and data leaks.  Rather than focusing on new features (like the upcoming launch of the GPT store, [now pushed back to 2024](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-delays-custom-gpt-stores-launch-axios-2023-12-01/)), shouldn't they address the gaping holes in their security first?\n2. Are they ever going to add a search feature or other method (folders/tags/etc.) so people can find old chats?\n3. Are they aware that their GPT creation feature is somewhat broken?  For example, it will guide users through a series of questions but later questions completely overwrite configuration questions from previous questions.  In other words, it doesn't take existing configuration information into account in later wizard steps.\n\nI'm sure I could come up with 100 questions, but I'll be impressed if you have time to ask even one of these. \ud83d\ude06 Hope your meeting goes well and you get all the questions on your mind answered!",

        "body": "Could you please inquire about when GPT-4 for Plus users, rather than API users, will be fixed? Alternatively, consider reopening the old version of GPT-4. Since the developer days a week ago until now, with the same prompts, my GPT has shifted from being concise and having its own thoughts to generating a plethora of nonsense, ignoring prompt cues, and repeating phrases like 'understand your feelings,' 'let's do something together,' or 'remember you're not alone.' Is this due to 1. enabling dynamic computation, 2. bugs arising from the not well-debugged use of features like the DALL-E network, or 3. the truncation of the original 128-context for Plus users causing several conversations to crash?",

For example, I currently copy/paste online textbook content into it and ask it to read it back to me (turning it into an instant audio book, basically). Then, I might talk to it at length about certain concepts in that book, having it break down concepts and asking it a million questions about it. I might use it as a brainstorming / sound-boarding partner while driving or in the shower. Anytime I need a quick troubleshooting or how-to on the computer, I'll upload it screenshots and prompt it to assist me, and repeat the process until we've found a solution. I could go on and on (and I'm sure this sub is an endless repository of use case examples).",

Ask chatgpt to guide you through installing them in docker. You don't get the image parts (unless your PC is good enough to run the bigger ones, and the investment is kinda worth it to upgrade vs a continual subscription), but llama is arguably as good as 4o in text, and you'll have the framework to keep upgrading as new releases come out, keep data private, use your own data, and it works with chatgpt and Claude as well as almost any other model still if you decide you don't like the system. \n\nDon't forget the big hosted version of llama is free too. \n\nThat's what I did when I looked to cancel. Haven't looked back and now I use it even more. Starting to build my own agent framework now with local llama doing most of the actual coding, I just design the high level processes, data structures, and work on prompts. \n\nI encourage others to critique or expand my approach in the reply comments.",

        "body": "The use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in business applications requires a cautious approach due to several limitations and current issues. Here's an in-depth analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Context and Nuance**: LLMs, despite their sophisticated algorithms, often struggle with understanding context and nuance, especially in complex or specialized domains. This can be problematic in business settings where accuracy and the understanding of industry-specific jargon are crucial. For instance, in legal or medical fields, a slight misinterpretation by the model can lead to significant consequences.\n\n2. **Data Privacy and Security Concerns**: LLMs are trained on vast datasets that may include sensitive or proprietary information. Businesses must be vigilant about the data they input into these models, as there is a risk of data breaches or unintended data sharing. Moreover, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA when using LLMs can be challenging.\n\n3. **Bias and Fairness Issues**: LLMs can inherit and even amplify biases present in their training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in business applications, such as hiring, customer service, and marketing. The reputational risk and potential legal implications of biased AI decisions are significant concerns for businesses.\n\n4. **Dependency and Lack of Transparency**: Relying heavily on LLMs can create a dependency that may be risky if these systems encounter downtime or errors. Furthermore, the \"black box\" nature of these models often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain conclusions, which can be problematic for businesses that require transparency and accountability in their operations.\n\n5. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The regulatory landscape for AI and LLMs is still evolving. Businesses must navigate uncertain legal waters concerning the use of AI, which can include issues around intellectual property, liability for AI decisions, and ethical considerations in AI deployment.\n\n6. **Resource Intensiveness and Scalability**: Implementing and maintaining LLMs can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and expertise. Small and medium-sized enterprises might find the cost and technical requirements prohibitive. Additionally, scaling these models for large-scale applications can present additional challenges.\n\n7. **Limitations in Generalization and Adaptability**: LLMs, while excellent at handling a wide range of topics, might not adapt well to highly specific or niche business requirements. Their ability to generalize can sometimes lead to oversimplified solutions that do not adequately address complex, industry-specific problems.\n\nIn summary, while LLMs offer transformative potential for businesses, they come with notable limitations and risks. Companies must approach their use with a strategic understanding of these challenges, ensuring compliance with legal standards, ethical considerations, and a commitment to addressing biases and maintaining data security. Regularly updating policies and practices in line with the evolving AI landscape is also essential for responsible and effective use of these technologies.",

        "body": "People utilize ChatGPT to write comments for several reasons, reflecting the diverse applications of AI in enhancing communication and content creation. Let's delve into the depth of this phenomenon.\n\n1. **Efficiency and Speed**: ChatGPT can generate text rapidly, significantly faster than most humans. This efficiency is particularly valuable when producing a large volume of comments or responses, saving considerable time and effort.\n\n2. **Overcoming Writer's Block**: Individuals sometimes struggle to articulate their thoughts or find the right words. ChatGPT, with its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, can help overcome these creative hurdles.\n\n3. **Language Proficiency and Enhancement**: For those not writing in their native language, ChatGPT can assist in crafting grammatically correct and fluently written comments. It can also help native speakers improve their language usage, offering varied vocabulary and sentence structures.\n\n4. **Consistency and Tone Management**: Maintaining a consistent tone or style across multiple comments can be challenging. ChatGPT can be programmed to adhere to a specific tone, be it formal, casual, technical, or playful, ensuring uniformity in communication.\n\n5. **Idea Generation and Expansion**: Sometimes, users know what they want to say but need help to expand their thoughts. ChatGPT can provide different perspectives or additional points, enriching the content of the comments.\n\n6. **Educational and Informational Purposes**: ChatGPT can be used to craft comments that are informative and educational. Its vast knowledge base enables it to provide detailed explanations or clarifications on various topics, making it a valuable tool for educational discussions.\n\n7. **Social Media Engagement**: In the realm of social media, engaging and witty comments can boost visibility and interaction. ChatGPT's ability to generate creative and engaging responses can be particularly useful for social media managers or influencers.\n\n8. **Accessibility**: For individuals with disabilities that make typing or writing challenging, ChatGPT offers an accessible alternative to create written content.\n\n9. **Experimentation and Learning**: Some users engage with ChatGPT for learning purposes, to understand how AI language models work or to experiment with AI-generated text.\n\n10. **Emotional Detachment**: When dealing with sensitive or emotionally charged topics, ChatGPT can provide a level of detachment and objectivity, helping to craft responses that are considerate and diplomatic.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT's versatility in handling various aspects of text generation - from enhancing linguistic proficiency to ensuring consistency and creativity - makes it a valuable tool for writing comments. Its application ranges from personal use in social media to professional settings, where efficiency and quality of communication are paramount.",

You don\u2019t have to say Hey GPT-4 or whatever. It\u2019s kind of nice if you read a non-fiction book or textbook and need clarification, as long as you don\u2019t make a noise and your phone is reasonably close.\n\nOf course with textbooks you have to accept some unknown error rate. It will never say: \u201eI don\u2019t know\u201c even if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nUnfortunately it also responded when I did the dishes or when there were other sounds in the room. And then once it responds it won\u2019t shut up until done.\n\nSo far it\u2019s not as great as having a human in the room you can talk to from time to time, who doesn\u2019t think you said something when you do your dishes, and who also says: I don\u2019t know. Also, quality will degrade the more you fill up the context window, so from time to time you should reset the chat. \n\nI hope the new version will improve those things.",

Voice also allows the model to better understand human emotions, such as frustration or sarcasm carried through tone, adding a context layer you don\u2019t have with text. I think the sky is the limit here, but it\u2019ll probably come down to user adoption.",

Especially considering how freakishly expensive it is to use via API.",

I am also confident there is a lot of stuff you can do, but you have to acknowledge that not everybody is doing what you are doing with AI. Even in your case, I highly doubt that you have access to the deep learning data that the corporate giants are using. Nor do you have access to the latest greatest learning algorithms. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think it\u2019s critical that AI remain open source with a very active community enhancing it.  On the specific point of guard rails, I get it, you are operating without guard rails. But in the broader sense, your rig is still a one off local version with less capability than what corporate giants are able to produce. The bigger point was that corporate offerings will continue to be Increasingly constrained to the public. The full power of AI will be available to those who can afford it and by full I mean to include trained on the rich and massive data that is used to train the big AI systems.  Maintaining open source for AI is going to be an ongoing critical social challenge. Sorry for the rambling response. I did not take the time to boil it down.",

I'm not at home right now to dig it up I found it cuz I was getting into programming neuro nets and needed data.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're looking at chatgpt consider that it's only as big as it is because it's trying to be a solution for 'everything'. The models I'm using are more focused narrow solutions for roleplaying and assuming character personalities. There are also models that are focused on programming help as well.\n\nThe big corporations will be in control of the mega models that can do everything, the public will be picking specific models that are trained on focused data to do specific things and require a lot less hardware power.\n\nIt's also brand new technology that will be optimized. Currently you can get an AI specific computer custom built with 148 or so gb of ram for $22k that can most certainly load a 128b model. $22k ain't affordable for anyone of course but it's not as bad as most people were thinking in the 100k+ range",

Please keep us updated. \n\nHere's my own conclusion after using the system for another purpose:\n\n1. Accuracy and reliability: This is the holy grail of LLM development. An accurate and reliable wide purpose LLM is still a dream at this point. Conclusion: For the moment, build as many GPTs with as narrow of a purpose as possible. The more advances in base models, the fewer GPTs we will need.\n2. Loop: I have no answer for that. Better to request an answer from OpenAI. In an enterprise setting, I would expect to be able to proxy all queries and responses. \n4. This is a basic functionality of GPTs.\n5. I'm not sure to understand. Fine-tuning is, by definition, adjusting a very specific model weights to be better at a specific task. As soon as you change the model, all fine-tuning, i.e., the delta between the old base model weights and the old fine-tuned model weights, is unusable. The more advanced the model, the less fine-tuning you'll need in the first place.",

Really appreciate you sharing your thoughts. \n\nJust to give you a better picture of how things work with us: our Architects aren\u2019t really in charge of green-lighting designs and implementations. They act more like advisors, offering guidance and support. So, bringing in an AI chat tool \u2013 one that\u2019s on point with our company\u2019s guidelines and recommendations \u2013 could really help our teams get the advice they need without overstepping. This might even free up our Architects to play a larger role in the crucial final decisions. Your insights have been really helpful in fleshing out this idea.   \n\n\nThanks a bunch for that!",

I did join the waitlist for Google NotebookLM.\n\nI did a little research and it seems I can maybe use a Python script with an html file to upload documents to chatgpt for review (I've tried tinkering around without any programming know-how). It seems like a too-easy-to-do-operation (or too good to be true) but I'm having some difficulties getting this to work. Does anyone have a simple premade script or code I could review that I could run on Windows OS or Android for this purpose of uploading and reviewing documents or are there any other scripts or tools I can use for this purpose? I was already able to create some excel macros following advice fro. ChatGPT importing data from differnt files and workbooks, so I think I am competent enough to DIY if I need to, but I'm just stuck on the script coding for Python, which I've never used before.\n\nThank you again, for sharing, this is good information.",

Tons of apps (GPTs in this case) popping up, with a few hits that really rake it in and a lot of misses that fade out.

For most devs, it\u2019s gonna be about quick, smart integrations that make existing stuff smarter, not reinventing the wheel.\n\nAnd yeah, OpenAI's setting the pricing stage with GPT Plus. It's like when Apple set the standard for what mobile apps should cost. Suddenly, everyone's comparing their price tags to that.\n\nSeems like OAI is playing the long game, pushing for a piece of the SaaS pie while they eye the AGI horizon. They're letting the market do the trial and error for them with GPTs, then scooping up what works.\n\nAll these points are solid, but let's not forget, this whole AI marketplace is still in diapers.

        "body": "Actively working in marketing specifically in the B2B enterprise space, I can say with confidence that a large number of organizations have zero desire to learn how to properly use something like chatgpt to its fullest extent. The marketing agencies with the most success in this space will combine this AI technology with the right marketing insight and strategy to create a polished and premium experience for an enterprise-level organization at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing services. Specifically, the ones that get really good at tuning an AI model to fully understand the context of a business, who they are, what they offer, and how it solves a customer's pain points and then use that to generate scalable levels of content will become highly valuable to organizations who are looking for a turnkey marketing solution at an affordable cost.  \n\n\nA key aspect of a successful business is creating convenience - this is why a chilled 20-ounce soda is more expensive than a 2 liter of room temperature soda, or why people utilize restaurants when they could easily buy ingredients and cook their meals for cheaper.   \n\n\nNow more than ever, the tools are readily available to build virtually anything but only a certain part of the population will have the skill set to master the tools to the fullest extent and combine that with a premium user experience and an effective business model. The ones that are able to combine all of those facets into a legitimate established business will make a killing. At least that's my two cents.",

They are the most profitable software company of all time for a reason. That\u2019s the point. I don\u2019t see a moat around companies that will have to pay for both cloud and OpenAI IP. Microsoft is in an ideal position to own the whole thing. They already have a big cloud division.\n\nThe point Im making here is that the value of building on top of OpenAI is significantly diminished because small companies will have extremely low margins to live on. The costs are way too high.\n\nThe suckers here are the companies building on top of OpenAI. They will not have software margins to work with. They will not be venture-backable.\n\nUntil other large companies step in and force the cloud costs waaayyyy down, it\u2019s not clear how this is a sustainable business model for front end genAI cos.",

        "body": "I am not aligned with Peter Thiel\u2019s politics at all. But his 2015 book Zero to One brilliantly explains the problem of competion. He advises all start ups to avoid competition because as soon as competition comes in, prices go down and with it, a race to the bottom that kills margins. Margins is what makes software business attractive. \n\nThis is an apex predator business sector, where competition will reorganize the giants. All large tech cos can build and host models as they are based on the same papers. \n\nGenAI companies cannot compete. they are clients of companies that host models. They are a P&L item on someone else\u2019s quarterly report. They are far too costly to run to be attractive businesses for VCs. \n\nGenAI is a business analogous to advertising agencies. They are enterprise clients of tech companies. \n\nThey will make the cloud business explode. Cloud is the real winner in the AI business.\n\nDevelopers should proceed with extreme caution. There is far too much cost and competition for them to make any significant money.",

Regardless, I'm game. \nWhat are your thoughts on the recent findings and emerging theory derived from the quest to understand quantum entanglement. There was a recent publication talking about whether reality is essentially a hologram. The existence of our own realities and what we deem as \"real\" could be predicated on our interaction with it. The possible  question being when you can not see it and/or not interacting with it does it still exist. Like an open world video game, the scene is not rendered until your character can see it and /or interacts with it.",

I think I would contact the alien race first to gather more info. And then... oh man, negotiating with the Klingons is never easy. But offering them Russian Vodka? Haha, that's hilarious! Glad it actually worked and there's peace in the galaxy now. Good job, Captain Kirk!",

        "body": "I did one, I went on a mission to help the klingons recover the sword of Khaless. After we recovered it from the planet, I told the shuttle crew to hold on while I went to the back of the shuttle and called up an Orion contact. I then took nav and flew to meet the Orion and sell him the sword. I offered to cut the other crew in on the deal but they didn't respond.\n\nI replicated a fake to hand over to starfleet to give to the klingons, and it was going well. Returned to the starbase, and I was called to a debrief, and tried to duck out by going to the bar to call up my orion contact to help me get off the starbase. A klingon came by and I told him everything went well and he started to share some future battle plans with me.\n\nI ducked out and found out my encrypted call to the orion was flagged and was called to a meeting with intel. I fudged my way through it but they were onto me. I got to my quarters and locked the door and security came again and I told them it was a malfunction.\n\nFinally I pinged the orion one more time and told him I had intel from the klingon to trade if he could get me off the starbase. Finally he did get me off and dropped me off at another planet. The game told me the character had crossed a line and betrayed starfleet values and there was no going back now.\n\nWith the money I gained from selling the klingons prized artifact, I went to the shipyard and had a romulan warbird refitted to be a luxury battle cruiser. I checked the news about the battle I gave the intel to the Orions, and apparently the Orions had set up a trap but the Klingons eventually got the sword back through a huge amount of casualties on both sides.\n\nNow I just cruise around in my luxury cruiser with a team of experts.",
