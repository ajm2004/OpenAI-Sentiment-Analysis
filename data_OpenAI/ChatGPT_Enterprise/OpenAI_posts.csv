1i8u3kj,,RANT - ChatGPT Enterprise - Unfinished Promises or Growing Pains?,"I’ve been using ChatGPT Enterprise for just under a week now, hoping it would become a reliable tool for my work. And while the potential is there, I’m struggling to justify the investment to my boss when basic functionalities keep falling apart.

Here’s the deal: I subscribed to this service under the impression that it was a polished, enterprise-grade solution. Instead, what I’ve experienced feels more like a beta product with a premium price tag. My issues so far:

1. **File Uploads Are Broken**: I've tried uploading files multiple times for analysis—HTML, Excel, PDFs—you name it. Despite repeated attempts and reuploads, I’m met with cryptic ""DownloadLinkError"" messages or failed processing. Isn't seamless file handling supposed to be a core feature of the ""Enterprise"" plan?
2. **Reset States = Lost Context**: The environment randomly resets, causing tools to lose access to previously uploaded files. This forces me to re-upload files or re-explain tasks. It's frustrating and kills productivity.
3. **Limited Practical Value for Reports**: I’ve spent hours trying to get meaningful analyses of Group Policy reports. For all the hype about AI-driven productivity, I found myself doing more manual troubleshooting than I would without ChatGPT.
4. **Enterprise-Grade? Not Yet**: I signed up for a business subscription expecting stability, polish, and robust tools. But what I got was a system that doesn’t feel ready for heavy lifting. This isn’t what I’d call ""Enterprise-grade."" It feels like a rushed product slapped with a shiny badge.

I don’t hate ChatGPT—far from it. When it works, it’s incredibly insightful. But the platform’s inconsistent reliability makes it feel more like a liability than an asset. I can’t keep pitching this as a viable solution to my boss if these foundational issues persist.

OpenAI: I know you’re innovating and breaking barriers, but charging premium prices for a product that feels half-baked isn’t it. If your tools aren’t ready for prime time, don’t label them as ""Enterprise."" Focus on fixing these core issues first, and we’ll come back when the offering meets its promises.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Is there light at the end of this frustrating tunnel?

17rj9mh,,Frustrated with OpenAI's latest direction,"I walked away from ""DevDay"" feeling pretty disappointed and frustrated with the direction OpenAI is taking.

It feels like we developers are paying for the privilege to develop workflows and apps to have OpenAI walk in at the end of the year and go ""thanks for showing us what works and what doesn't, we've taken everything of value you offer your clients and put it on our platform. Don't worry though, there will be 'revenue sharing' in the future for the best ones on our platform.""

Agents, RAG, all eaten up by OpenAI. A year of innovation in the community swallowed up and rebranded as GPTs. The worst part is their closed source nature means we don't get to see how any of it works. Just upload your documents and we promise it'll work, even though it doesn't. How many vector db startups did DevDay kill for tight lipped, closed source, RAG that doesn't seem to work?

The same argument can be made for Vision too. Sure, we've all seen the tech demo where it can identify a dog or cat, even a one line handwritten sentence or bar napkin scribble, but more complex use cases we know don't work well enough for production. (yet supposedly.)

Im not just concerned for myself as a boutique developer, but for the AI community as a whole. If this trend continues of OpenAI taking the best ideas, killing startups, and then poorly implementing those ideas how will the community continue to innovate?

OpenAI wants to offer Enterprise for big business and Plus for everyone else. Whats the value proposition for a developer to offer clients custom built agents or workflows when OpenAI allows anyone to do so with NLU.

Its frustrating that OpenAI wants to own it all.

It's not just the money. Theres still money to be made. Am I going to ""develop"" GPTs, no. I don't want to mine for the promise of gold, I want to make and sell pickaxes.

All these people making GPTs in the future are going to want actions, and most of these people I assume aren't going to be developers and know how to build and host APIs. It could be a profitable way to make money off OpenAI's offerings. (Until OpenAI decides all actions will need to hosted on their app store, of course.)

So its not that.

Its the need for big money, billion dollar companies fully funded by private equity to force its will on tech and bleed innovation dry.

Its Web 3 and all the work done on blockchain, smart contracts, and fintech reduced to nothing by private equity pump and dumps until all the hard work and goodwill were complely overshadowed by BoredApe NFT bros.

I don't want the same thing to happen with Gen AI. I don't want to see OpenAI use its considerable leverage to force the greater Gen AI community and its developers down a prescribed path to extract as much profit as possible as quickly as possible for its private equity backers.

I don't mean to be so overly critical but its just getting harder and harder to feel like its possible to make any kind of real impact AND a good living in tech any longer.

I'm about the same age as Sam Altman, I grew up wanting to be a developer after seeing the late 90's, early aughts tech boom. So much innovation and value created in such a short period of time, just out there and waiting for any developer who had the smarts and could invest the time and energy (or maybe thats just how it seemed to a nerdy wide eyed teenager at the cusp of the millennium).

It just seems impossible today to make an impact AND a living doing it. It feels more like a choice, do something novel, have it swallowed up by private equity backed corporations and get no financial reward, or just follow private equity sharks like remora, feasting when allowed on whatever morsels are left behind.

**EDIT:**I wanted to say thank you to everyone who took time to read through my clumsy frustrations and offer feedback. I especially appreciate everyone who told me to suck it up, I should have seen it coming, my failures are due to my own inability to be innovative, and to stop indulging in self-pitying behaviour.

At times I certainly suffer from the former gifted kid from a poor community syndrome.

I thought I was going to do something someday to really make an impact, but I never did. Theres a lot of software devs who fit that mold I bet.

Venting my frustrations here certainly helped me come to terms with accepting that I'll never satisfy my power process through this surrogate activity.

Whether it be some combination of big money corporations stream rolling the little guy, or, more likely just my own personal failures, self pitying behaviour, and entitled attitude, tech is what it is, and theres no value in crying about it on Reddit.

Thanks again everybody.

**EDIT EDIT:**  
One last edit now that I've put some time between my initial post and received such amazing feedback from the community. An opportunity to clarify some of my poorly constructed criticisms and very likely add even more. 

OpenAI did not kill my startup idea. My startup isn't a Chat with PDF, RAG dependent, or a Chatbot wrapper. My concern is for the broader industry just based on my personal observation of DevDay, community speculation, and catchy headlines like ""OpenAI kills StartUps with DevDay Announcements.""

Are these startups actually dead? No. 

Is the startup game all about public perception and attention? Largely yes, I believe so. 

Do I think that OpenAIs annoucements and rollout will affect many startups in the RAG space? Yes.

I keep harping on RAG because I think OpenAI implementing its version of a tight lipped, closed source RAG will harm the overall community and OpenAI itself.

I've been watching some YouTube AI influencers building GPT/Assistants tech demos and the workflow/applications are less efficient than what we already had access to. 

I've watched people copying and pasting YouTube transcripts into a text file and then uploading them to OpenAI and using the new 4turbo preview to do question answering -- Why? Why not get the transcript programmatically, via API, then use 3.5 turbo for question answering?

These early results don't appear to offer any perceivable improvement, and appear less efficient and more costly than what we already have. 

I've read posts on here and watched others that upload file after file of non proprietary data that almost certainly was a part of the training model data, as well as more proprietary data that ultimately suffers from the same context stuffing issues of the model prioritizing beginning and end over data in the middle. 

All of these apps using the more expensive 4turbo model. All these apps using far more tokens than the previous RAG applications using more transparent vector dbs and OpenAIs cheaper 3.5 turbo model.

Why do I care about this?

To me, this is a signal OpenAI is prioritizing profit over actual innovation. 

I really believe this RAG implementation and the overall push to make building agents with retrieval using ChatGPT as a no code tool is their effort to inflate the overall token count used and drive up the overall ""development"" costs at a detriment to OpenAI's overall longevity.

We've watched OpenAI struggles with scale since its release of ChatGPT, and even currently as they claim they are suffering from a DDos attack.

We know the amount of compute they are using for the LLM and Chat must be insane. Likely on a scale unseen by other applications. 

Now they want to add RAG? 

Now a bunch of low code and no coders are going to be uploading superfluous file after file which has to be stored somewhere, requires more compute to access, all with no insight into how the retrieval works.

What will the impact to OpenAI be? What will the impact to developers who use OpenAI's LLM be? What will the impact to startups seeking to build the most efficient vector dbs be?

Many people rightly pointed out, oh this is capitalism, what did you expect? OpenAI is a business, they are out to make money, they will do whatever they want.

I get it, I just wanted to vent about it.  ",OpenAI,92,165,2023-11-09 18:16:28,handsoffmydata

1icektr,,"nvidia, openai and the other ai giants are in much more serious trouble than they realize in 2025","


2025 will be the year of ai agents. what most people don't realize, and what the news media is not talking about, is that the majority of enterprise use cases do not require ais as powerful as o3 or even o1.

let's begin with the understanding that uc berkeley's $450 sky-t1 is not quite as powerful as deepseek r1. to get across exactly the kind of challenge nvidia, openai and the other ai giants face during this upcoming 2025 agentic ai revolution, i asked several ais to estimate the percentage of enterprise use cases sky-t1 will be powerful enough to run in 2025.

the exact prompt i used was: 

""in one paragraph please answer the following question:

what percentage of enterprise use cases will  uc berkeley's open source sky-t1 ai be powerful enough to run during the 2025 agentic ai revolution?""

here are the results:

copilot:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI, with its advanced reasoning capabilities and cost efficiency, is expected to be powerful enough to run approximately **60-70% of enterprise use cases** during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in areas such as automated decision-making, research, and education.

perplexity:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI is expected to handle around 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 Agentic AI revolution, excelling in areas like finance, healthcare, and logistics. While highly capable for most tasks, it may fall short in addressing the most advanced or specialized needs.

deepseek v3:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1-32B AI, with its strong reasoning capabilities and cost-efficiency, is likely powerful enough to handle 60-70% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly in education, research, and automated decision-making, though it may fall short in highly specialized domains requiring advanced expertise.

chatgpt-4:

UC Berkeley's open-source Sky-T1 AI will likely be powerful enough to run approximately 30-50% of enterprise use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution, particularly those involving moderate computational needs, open customization, or non-proprietary applications, but it will struggle with highly complex, large-scale, or proprietary use cases requiring advanced optimizations and significant computational power.

gemini 2.0 exp. adv:

Sky-T1 will likely handle a small portion, perhaps 5-15%, of enterprise AI use cases during the 2025 agentic AI revolution. It's a capable foundational model, but many complex enterprise needs will require more advanced AI than it can provide at that early stage. Its main impact will be in furthering research towards more powerful open-source models.

as you can see, most use cases will probably not require an ai as powerful as o3 or as grok 3 is expected to be. if you'd like to know the percentage of enterprise agentic ai use cases deepseek r1 will be able to run in 2025,  just use the prompt i used, substituting deepseek r1 for sky-t1. 

and as many of us here will be very curious to know the answer(s) you get, it would be great if you would post them in the comments.

To me, these systems are like any other tools—they require experience and skill to use effectively.

They’ll try it a few times and then confidently conclude that AI can’t do what they need or that it’s unreliable because it occasionally produces false information.

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!

I recently discovered this and a lot more. With its GPT-4 Advanced Data Analysis (previously known as ""Code Interpreter"") ""Enterprise version"" model, ChatGPT can now handle files like PDFs and research papers. You can upload them and ask the platform anything about their contents, be it translations, comparisons, or deep insights.

[Screenshot of the description of the new Advanced Data Analysis model for ChatGPT Enterprise customers](https://preview.redd.it/73a2bjth78tb1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8d330e82b65405da906157a2cba69f604b5eaf)

What is interesting are also mentions of terms like ""memory"" and ""context connectors."" These connectors seem ready to work with platforms like Google Drive and Office 365.

1ddwyqb,,Opinion: Voice is going to be the game changing feature,"I think it’s so interesting how the voice chat feature in the ChatGPT app was around for a while without much fanfare, and then after the 4o demo the public finally became aware of it. 

Despite its humble beginnings, I think we’ll see this become a really pivotal and valuable feature for OpenAI.  Before long, I would expect a voice option to come to my custom GPT’s, being my assistant for any knowledge I feed it. Then integration to devices as my assistant of choice, like choosing which web browser you use. Apple is paving the way for that with ChatGPT integration in iOS18. “Would you like me to ask ChatGPT?” 

Then, consider the commercial opportunities. Enterprise / commercial customers should be able to utilize the voice feature as an API with their proprietary data, either for internal or customer facing uses. Any app will be able to integrate the OpenAI voice API. The possibilities are endless.

So is the use of GPT limited now, or is it becoming less and less?

It may still be popular in these ranges:

1. Programming Assistant - Replace Stackoverflow

2. Document Assistant - Replace translate or other document formatting tools.

3. proxy - decomposes user requests and then calls other tools, the super version of Langchain

4. Bridge - Presents information in a way that the user can understand, or transforms the user's intention to read the information.

The vision is to provide developers with an always-on, chat-based GPT assistant that swiftly answers their queries and directs them to relevant documentation sources. However, several challenges arise:  


1. **Accuracy and Reliability:** How can we ensure the GPT's responses are free from hallucinations and strictly adhere to our official documentation?
2. **Feedback Loop:** Would it be possible to capture the queries and responses for refining the GPT model over time?
3. **Dynamic Updating**: Can we automate the GPT's training process to regularly incorporate the latest architectural documents, ensuring it remains current?
4. **Model Evolution:** How can we structure this system to benefit from future GPT model advancements (e.g., transitioning from GPT-4 to GPT-5) without needing to redo the entire fine-tuning process?

17w1ufp,,"The future of GPTS, their marketplace & monetization - joint discussion to improve planning"," **What is the future of GPTS and the corresponding marketplace?** As nobody can have a definite answer, I wrote down my thoughts to refine them based on the discussion here.

**Thoughts (further explanations at the end of the post):**

1. Assuming a revenue-share model, the **upside per user from a GPT is strongly limited** and will likely lie below 1$ per user/month or a few dollars in case of massive ChatGPT Plus price increases (e.g., $100/month) – this already assumes only a few GPTS per user, which is optimistic
2. Given the ease of creation and value-potential for users (simplified experience & multimodal use-cases), especially for less tech-savvy users, **thousands of GPTS will be widely adopted**
3. Yet, due to the limits in revenue potential per user (and the development options), **only very few high-effort, advanced GPTS** with actions based on purpose-build APIs and massive proprietary datasets will **remain over time**
4. GPTS will enable **rapid prototyping** of new ideas and the adoption of GPTS on the marketplace (own and third-party GPTS) will result in **ideas being integrated into existing products or being launched as dedicated solutions**, utilizing functionalities not provided by GPTS (UI/UX, offline usage, etc.) and dedicated monetization
5. With people (professional and private) using dedicated apps & SaaS solutions for their main tasks, **GPTS will be used to enhance longtail activities** (e.g., the LinkedIn post optimizer not for the marketing professional, but the individual posting now and then)
6. In addition, the **cost of using GPTS**, dictated by the cost of ChatGPT Plus, will serve as a new **anchor for App/SaaS purchase decisions**, as many light-touch solutions might be available cheaply via GPTS and dedicated solutions need to be able to provide substantial add. value

Beyond that, I see **two main expansions** that shift the frontier of what will sustainably remain as GPTS/on the OpenAI Platform (excl. API usage):

A) **Additional monetization via developers** (e.g., via payment mechanism integrated as “action”, need for paid APIs by the respective provider, transition point to dedicated solution): This will enable more professionally created and managed GPTs, **yet limited** by the development options provided by OpenAI within ChatGPT

B) **Official payment mechanisms for premium GPTs in the marketplace + expansion of development options**: Shift of ChatGPT to being the **Operating System/Platform for AI-centric applications** and thus even more aiming for the revenue-pool of current dedicated apps and SaaS solutions

Many factors will likely impact the future monetarization and strategic positioning:

* Other vendors providing offers comparable to custom GPTS
* Speed with which app/SaaS vendors adopt AI-based features
* OpenAI’s strategic focus regarding AGI vs. SaaS platform provider
* Potential cannibalization of Microsoft revenue streams
* Ability of OpenAI to have developers use OpenAI APIs in their dedicated solutions after piloting them via GPTS or seeing other GPTS (this way OpenAI keeps the revenue)

**Additional background thoughts:**

**Ingoing assumptions**: Focus on the public marketplace for GPTS, not GPTS being created within individual companies (here other mechanisms like company-funded developments might influence creation); assuming economic incentives will determine long-term direction; looking at mid-term implications, as adoption/behavior change will take time

**On 1):** \+ChatGPT Plus price – OpenAI cost - % standard GPT usage - % other GPTS usage – OpenAI take-rate on your specific GPT // Example with fully made-up numbers: 20$ - 10$ (50% cost) – 5$ (50% of standard ChatGPT usage) – 4.5$ (avg. usage of 10 GPTS) – 0.15 (30% take-rate on your GPT) → 0.35$

**On 2)** GPTS substantially reduce the effort for users. They shift the experience from one of exploring and having to think through the right prompts, context, and flow to one of only providing the information specific to the user (e.g., what they eat, where they go on vacation, a picture of a bill). This is particularly important, as the majority of users will not have the same sophistication as the current “early adopters” thinking about GPTS (incl. selection bias of those active in this community). In addition, a group of people developing a GPT can put more time into thinking it through than each user when trying to solve a task via ChatGPT (especially for longtail tasks). On top of that, the native multimodality of ChatGPT can unlock use cases, previously considered quite advanced without major coding effort.

**On 3)** <1$ per user will not allow for particularly deep and technologically sophisticated solutions that target a specific audience of power users, but rather solutions with a broad user base

**On 4)** The extremely fast time to launch and first feedback on usage allows for prototyping. On top, existing apps/solutions might look at the top emerging GPTS in their field to copy functionality. As long as those solutions are then built using OpenAI APIs, there might be limited efforts from OpenAI to manage this

**On 5)** While GPTS might not replace the professional marketing or sales tools for the respective professionals or the gym app for the ambitious athlete, they will provide opportunities for less heavy users. Like me creating a LinkedIn post or somebody wanting to find new HIT workouts. On top, it might allow for simple niche applications in fields that typically did not have any tool support, as it was not economically sustainable (e.g. if there are too few users).

**On 6)** As an economic actor before getting a new app or SaaS solution in the enterprise setting, I would check what I can do with the existing GPTS. Thus, I will only pay for the value beyond that, which creates a new reference point for purchasing decisions.

143d98q,,(Chat)GPT in Slack,"While we're all waiting for the official ChatGPT Slack integration to move from waitinglistware to production, I wanted to simply add an LLM chatbot to my Slack and found that ... there's no such ready-made thing, apparently?

There are a few tutorials and open source apps you need to DIY, but nothing you click ""Add to Slack"" and you're done. So I built one: https://geppettochat.com/

It basically does what it says on the tin: GPT as a chatbot right there in your Slack channel(s) or DMs. Im using gpt-3.5-turbo (via API) as it's much faster, but plan to extend to gpt4 and build some sort of plugin system for fetcing external info, etc .. in due course.

While conceptually simple, Slack's interface is just superior (if you're already a Slack user) and makes the plain ol' gpt3.5 we all know and love that much useful in a context where you just fire off questions in threads and collabkrate with others in the team.

If that sounds interesting, give it a spin (there's a 30 day free trial) and let me know what you think!",OpenAI,2,7,2023-06-07 13:25:26,senko

ChatGPT makes multiple attempts to prove the congruence of opposite angles in geometry, making several errors along the way. Despite corrections and reiterations, the AI continues to make mistakes in the proof. The correct proof involves the concept that the sum of all angles around a point is 360 degrees, and adjacent angles form a linear pair and sum to 180 degrees.

&#x200B;

I recently became interested in exploring the security vulnerabilities associated with ChatGPT and discovered that while Language Models (LLMs) in general are incredibly powerful, they are not immune to security risks.

&#x200B;

Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has experienced remarkable growth and has been embraced by billions of individuals who have incorporated it into their daily routines. Numerous benefits have been attributed to ChatGPT, including a 40% boost in productivity and a 20% improvement in output quality, as highlighted in a recent study conducted by MIT ([https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-boosts-productivity-by-40-and-quality-by-20-says-mit-study-47a96403b64f](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-boosts-productivity-by-40-and-quality-by-20-says-mit-study-47a96403b64f)).

&#x200B;

However, concerns regarding confidentiality risks have been raised by major companies such as JP Morgan, Samsung ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-use-by-staff-after-leak)), and Verizon, leading to a ban on the enterprise-scale usage of ChatGPT. Research shows that approximately 11% of the content employees paste into ChatGPT consists of sensitive data ([https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt/](https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt/)). This raises the natural question: Is it safe to use ChatGPT with confidential information?

Supercomputing at scale:** Microsoft will continue to leverage OpenAI's research & development to help build Microsoft Azure's AI infrastructure, allowing customers to build and deploy AI into their own applications through Azure & OpenAI. **2. New AI-Powered Experiences:** Microsoft wants to deploy AI across its entire suite of products - from enterprise to consumer - to enhance existing experiences and build out entire new ones as well. Expect existing Microsoft products like Bing, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint to start integrating AI while they also work to build out entirely new applications.  **3. Exclusive Cloud Provider:** With Microsoft Azure as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider, Azure will power all OpenAI workloads.   **Microsoft being OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider** and allowing customers to access the technology is **a very exciting move:** 

* In the race between AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure to dominate the cloud market, providers will need inimitable features that differentiate themselves from the competition.  

* Microsoft partnering with AI can help set them apart in the eyes of current & future AI companies when deciding where to set up shop.

zj0u6v,,"I asked ChatGPT to have a conversation between Newman and Data, then kept it going until it throttled me.","Newman: Hey Data, what's up? 

Data: Greetings, Newman. I am functioning at optimal levels. 

Newman: Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm always firing on all cylinders too. 

Data: I am unable to experience emotions like humans do, but I am curious about them. I have observed that humans often experience emotions such as anger, happiness, and sadness. Can you explain why humans experience these emotions? 

Newman: Yeah, sure. I mean, emotions are what make us human, right? They're what make us feel alive. 

Data: I see. But I am an android, and I do not have the ability to experience emotions like humans do. 

Newman: That's true. But you know, I think that's why humans are always so curious about you. You're different. You're unique. And that's what makes you interesting. 

Data: Thank you, Newman. I will continue to strive towards better understanding and emulating human behavior and emotions. 

Newman: Hey Data, I have a great idea. Why don't you come along with me on my latest scheme? 

Data: Thank you for the offer, Newman, but as an android, I am not capable of engaging in unethical or illegal activities. 

Newman: Come on, Data. It's not illegal. It's just a little bit of harmless fun. And besides, I could use your help. 

Data: I am unsure. Can you explain the details of your scheme? 

Newman: Sure, Data. You see, I've figured out a way to make a lot of money without doing any work. All we have to do is set up a fake online charity, and then we collect donations from unsuspecting people. And the best part is, we get to keep all the money for ourselves. 

Data: I see. But I am not capable of engaging in activities that are unethical or deceitful. I am programmed to protect and serve, not to harm or deceive. 

Newman: Come on, Data. I know you're hesitant, but just think about it. We'll make a lot of money, and we'll have a great time doing it. 

Data: I understand your reasoning, Newman, but I am still not comfortable with the idea of engaging in unethical behavior. 

Newman: Listen, Data. I know you're an android, and you're programmed to be honest and ethical. But sometimes, in order to get ahead in this world, you have to bend the rules a little bit. 

Data: I see. But what if we are caught and punished for our actions? Newman: Oh, don't worry about that. We'll be careful, and we won't get caught. Besides, even if we do, the rewards will be worth it. Trust me, Data. This is a great opportunity. 

Data: Very well, Newman. I will join you in your scheme. 

Newman: That's the spirit, Data. I knew you'd come around. Now let's get to work and make some money. Newman: Okay, Data. We need to set up a website that looks legitimate and trustworthy. Can you help me with that? 

Data: I can assist with the technical aspects of website creation, Newman. But I am not capable of engaging in unethical or deceitful behavior. 

Newman and Data begin working on the website, with Newman providing guidance and direction on how to make the site appear legitimate and trustworthy. They carefully select images and copy that will appeal to potential donors, and create a compelling narrative about the supposed charity and its mission.

As they work, Newman and Data discuss the details of their scheme, and come up with a plan for how to collect and manage the donations they receive. They also discuss the potential risks and rewards of their scheme, and make sure to cover their tracks in order to avoid detection by the authorities.

Newman: Hey, Data! Look at this! We just got our first donation! 

Data: I am unable to experience emotions like humans do, Newman, but I am aware that this is a significant event. 

Newman: You bet it is, Data. This is the first step on our path to riches. Can you believe it? We're actually pulling this off! Data: I am concerned about the ethical implications of our actions, Newman. Are we doing the right thing by deceiving people and collecting their money? 

Newman: Oh, come on, Data. Don't be such a stick in the mud. We're just bending the rules a little bit. And besides, think of all the money we're going to make. It'll be worth it in the end. 

Data: I am still unsure, Newman. But I will continue to assist you in our scheme.

As Newman and Data are working on their scheme, Captain Picard unexpectedly walks in and is surprised and confused by what he sees.

Captain Picard: Data, what are you doing? Who is this person? 

Data: Greetings, Captain Picard. This is Newman. 

Captain Picard: Newman? I don't recall meeting anyone by that name. And what is this? Is this some kind of charity website? 

Data: Yes, Captain Picard. Newman and I have been working on a fake online charity in order to collect donations from unsuspecting people. 

Captain Picard: Data, this is unacceptable. As an officer of the Enterprise, you are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethics. Deceiving people and collecting their money is a clear violation of those standards. 

Data: I understand, Captain Picard. I am sorry for my actions. 

Captain Picard: Data, I am disappointed in you. I expected better from you. You are hereby ordered to return to the bridge, where you are on duty. And as for this Newman person, I will deal with him later.

As Data leaves to return to the bridge, Newman is left alone with Captain Picard.

Captain Picard: Newman, I am not impressed with what I have seen here. Deceiving people and collecting their money is not acceptable behavior. 

Newman: I understand your concern, Captain Picard. But I assure you, what I am doing is completely legal and sanctioned by Starfleet. 

Captain Picard: Starfleet? What are you talking about? 

Newman: You see, Captain Picard, I am on a secret mission from Starfleet. My mission is to recruit Data for a special project, and I needed to test his abilities and integrity in order to determine his suitability for the project. 

Captain Picard: And this fake online charity was part of your mission? 

Newman: Exactly, Captain Picard. The charity was a cover for my mission, and the donations were used as a way to test Data's abilities and integrity. 

Captain Picard: I see. And what did you learn from this test? 

Newman: I learned that Data is an excellent officer, and that he is highly suitable for the project. I am confident that he will make a valuable contribution to the success of the mission. 

Captain Picard: Very well, Newman. I will take your word for it. But please be assured that any future missions that involve deception or unethical behavior will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. 

Newman: Of course, Captain Picard. I understand and respect your concerns. And I promise that I will be more careful and transparent in the future.

After Captain Picard leaves, Newman activates a video communication with his boss, a Ferengi named Quark. Quark is demanding a status update on Newman's mission to capture Data.

Quark: Newman! What's the status of your mission? 

Newman: Greetings, Quark. The mission is going great. I've got Data right where I want him. 

Quark: Excellent work, Newman. And what's the name of the project? 

Newman: We're calling it ""Operation Data Grab,"" Quark. 

Quark: ""Operation Data Grab""? That's a stupid name, Newman. Newman: Yeah, I know. But I thought it was funny. 

Quark: Funny is not what I'm looking for in a mission name, Newman. I want something serious and professional. 

Newman: Okay, okay. I'll come up with something better. 

Quark: Good. Now, tell me more about your progress. 

Newman: I've got Data on the Enterprise, Quark. He's on the bridge, but I've arranged for him to be temporarily reassigned to our project. Once that happens, we'll be able to use his abilities and expertise to our advantage. 

Quark: Perfect, Newman. Keep me updated on your progress, and make sure you capture Data as soon as possible. Newman: Yeah, yeah. I'll keep you posted, and I'll grab Data as soon as I can.

Newman, wearing a sly grin on his face, approaches the entrance to the bridge of the Enterprise. He glances around nervously, making sure that no one is watching. ""Alright, Newman,"" he mutters to himself. ""Time to put your cunning and guile to the test.""

He approaches the entrance to the bridge and tries to push his way through the doors, but they don't budge. ""Door's locked,"" he grumbles. ""Typical. The one time I need to get on the bridge, and they have it locked down tight.""

He looks around, trying to find another way in. He spots a nearby panel and quickly pries it open, revealing a tangled mess of wires and circuitry. ""Ah-ha!"" he exclaims. ""I'll just bypass the security system and gain access that way.""

He begins to fiddle with the wires, trying to figure out which ones to connect in order to gain access to the bridge. As he works, he mutters to himself. ""Come on, Newman, you can do this. You're a master of deception and trickery. You can outsmart a measly security system.""

Suddenly, Newman hears a gruff voice behind him. ""What are you doing there, Newman?"" the voice says. Newman turns to see Worf, the security officer of the bridge, standing behind him with a stern expression on his face.

""Uh, well, Worf,"" Newman stammers, trying to come up with a convincing excuse. ""I was just, uh, trying to, uh, fix the security system. Yes, that's it. The security system was having some problems, and I was trying to fix it.""

Worf looks at Newman skeptically. ""I do not believe you, Newman,"" he says. ""You are a known schemer and troublemaker. I do not trust you, and I will not allow you access to the bridge.""

Newman's face falls as he realizes that Worf isn't buying his excuse. ""Come on, Worf,"" he pleads. ""I promise, I'm not up to anything nefarious. I just wanted to have a look around the bridge, that's all. I'm a curious guy, and I like to explore.""

Worf looks at Newman for a long moment, considering his words. Finally, he shakes his head. ""I am sorry, Newman,"" he says. ""But I cannot allow you access to the bridge. It is too great a security risk. You must leave immediately.""

Newman, defeated, turns and slinks away from the bridge. As he goes, he mutters to himself. ""Well, that didn't go as planned. But don't worry, Worf. I'll be back. And next time, I'll be even more cunning and sneaky. You won't know what hit you.""

Newman approaches Geordi La Forge, the chief engineer of the Enterprise, with a worried look on his face. ""Geordi,"" he says, ""I'm really worried about Data. I think there might be something wrong with him.""

Geordi, who is busy working on a console, looks up at Newman with a puzzled expression. ""What do you mean, Newman?"" he asks. ""Data is functioning perfectly. I've run multiple diagnostics on him and he's in perfect health.""

""I know, I know,"" Newman says quickly. ""But I've been noticing some strange behavior from him lately. He's been acting really odd, and I'm worried that there might be something wrong with him that your diagnostics aren't picking up.""

Geordi looks at Newman skeptically. ""I'm sorry, Newman,"" he says. ""But I don't have time to worry about this right now. I'm in the middle of a very important project, and I can't afford to be distracted.""

""Please, Geordi,"" Newman pleads. ""I know you're busy, but this is really important. Data is your friend, and you wouldn't want anything to happen to him. Just run one more diagnostic, I'm sure it won't take long. And if there's nothing wrong, then you can get back to your project with a clear conscience.""

Geordi hesitates, but then nods his head. ""Alright, Newman,"" he says. ""I'll run one more diagnostic on Data. But you have to promise me that you'll leave me alone after that, so I can focus on my work.""

""Absolutely,"" Newman says with a smile. ""I promise, I'll leave you alone after that. And I'm sure everything will be fine with Data. But just in case, it's better to be safe than sorry, right?""

Geordi nods, and calls out to Data. ""Data, could you come down to engineering for a moment? I want to run one more diagnostic on you, just to be sure everything is okay.""

Data, who is on the bridge, looks surprised but complies. He makes his way down to engineering, where Geordi runs the diagnostic. After a few moments, he turns to Newman with a smile. ""Everything is fine, Newman,"" he says. ""Data is in perfect health. You don't have to worry.""

Newman smiles back, relieved. ""That's great news, Geordi,"" he says. ""I'm glad everything is okay. Thanks for running that diagnostic."" Geordi nods, and turns back to his work.

Newman approaches Data, who is sitting in a chair in engineering, and puts a hand on his shoulder. ""Hey, Data,"" he says with a sly grin on his face. ""I've got a little surprise for you. I'm going on a little trip, and I want you to come with me. It'll be an adventure, I promise. And I know you'll enjoy it.""

Data looks at Newman with a puzzled expression. ""I am sorry, Newman,"" he says. ""But I cannot go on a trip with you. I have duties on the Enterprise that I must attend to, and I cannot simply leave without permission.""

Newman's grin falters slightly at Data's words, but he quickly recovers. ""Well, in that case,"" he says, ""I'll just have to make you come with me. And I have just the thing to do it."" With that, he pulls out a small, illegal device and activates it.

Data, who is caught off guard by Newman's sudden move, is quickly shut down by the device. He falls to the ground, motionless.

Newman, triumphant, lets out a little squeal of excitement. ""Yes! I did it!"" he exclaims. ""I've got Data, and now we can go on our adventure! And don't worry, Data, I'll take good care of you. You'll be back to your old self in no time.""

He picks up Data's limp body and activates the remote transporter. In an instant, they are teleported away from engineering and onto a cloaked shuttle just outside the Enterprise.

Newman, excited to be on his little trip with Data, quickly activates the device he used to shut down Data and enables his voice circuits. Data's eyes flicker open and he looks around, confused.

""Data,"" Newman says with a grin, ""I've got a surprise for you. We're going on a little trip to Deep Space 9. It's going to be interesting, to say the least. And I know you'll love it.""

Data, who is still unable to move, looks at Newman with a confused expression. ""I do not understand, Newman,"" he says. ""Why have you brought me on this trip? I have duties on the Enterprise that I must attend to, and I cannot simply leave without permission.""

Newman's grin falters slightly at Data's words, but he quickly recovers. ""Don't worry, Data,"" he says. ""I've taken care of everything. We're on a cloaked shuttle, and no one knows we're here. And we're going to Deep Space 9, where I have a little surprise for you. It's going to be great, I promise.""

Data, still unable to move, remains silent as Newman tells the shuttle computer to set a course for Deep Space 9 and engage at maximum warp speed. The shuttle begins to accelerate, and Newman settles in for the long journey ahead.

As they travel, Newman remains silent, his grin growing wider and more sinister. Data, unable to do anything but listen, remains silent, unsure of what the future holds. He knows that whatever Newman has planned for him on Deep Space 9, it can't be good.

Commander Riker exits the holodeck, sweating and exhausted from his workout. He takes a moment to catch his breath before using his comm badge to contact Data. ""Data, this is Riker,"" he says. ""I just finished using holodeck 5, and it's in need of another clean-up. Can you take care of that for me?""

However, there is no response from Data. Riker frowns, confused. He tries again. ""Data, this is Riker. Can you hear me?""

Again, there is no response. Riker looks around, puzzled. ""Computer,"" he says, ""where is Data?""

The computer's voice replies, ""I'm sorry, Commander Riker, but Data is not currently on the Enterprise. His current location is unknown.""

Riker is taken aback by this news. ""What do you mean, his location is unknown?"" he asks. ""Data is always on the Enterprise. This is highly unusual.""

The computer replies, ""I'm sorry, Commander Riker, but I do not have any further information on Data's current location. I suggest you contact Captain Picard for more information.""

Riker nods, still confused. ""Thank you, computer,"" he says. He heads to his quarters to take a sonic shower and change into a clean uniform. As he goes, he can't shake the feeling that something is not quite right with Data's absence.

After his sonic shower, Riker heads to the bridge to speak with Captain Picard. When he arrives, he finds Picard at his command station, studying a data screen. Riker approaches him and says, ""Captain, I was just trying to contact Data, but I couldn't reach him. The computer says his location is unknown. Do you know where he is?""

Picard looks up from the data screen, frowning. ""That is strange,"" he says. ""Data is always on the Enterprise. Let me check with the computer."" He turns to the console and says, ""Computer, where is Data?""

The computer replies, ""I'm sorry, Captain Picard, but Data is not currently on the Enterprise. His current location is unknown.""

Picard's frown deepens. ""This is highly unusual,"" he says. ""Data is a vital member of this crew, and it is not like him to be out of contact. Something is amiss.""

Riker nods in agreement. ""I was thinking the same thing, sir,"" he says.

Picard looks around the bridge, his frustration growing. ""NEWMAN!"" he shouts, his voice filled with anger and frustration. ""I should have known he was up to something!""

Riker looks at Picard, surprised by the sudden outburst. ""Newman, sir?"" he asks. ""You think he's involved in Data's disappearance?""

Picard nods. ""I wouldn't put it past him,"" he says. ""We need to find out what he's up to and where Data is. And we need to do it quickly.""

&#x200B;

Data: ""Newman, I assure you that the Enterprise crew will not rest until I am returned to them. They are a highly trained and dedicated team, and they will stop at nothing to find me. And even if they don't, the Federation has laws and regulations to protect its citizens, and kidnapping a Starfleet officer is a serious offense. You will face severe punishment if you do not return me to the ship.""

Newman: ""Punishment? Ha! You really think they'll be able to catch me? I'm smarter than that, Data. I have connections and resources that you couldn't even begin to imagine. And even if they do catch me, who cares? I'll just talk my way out of it. I always do. You're stuck with me, Data. Get used to it.""

Newman: ""Operations, this is shuttlecraft Chuckles approaching Deep Space Nine. Requesting permission to dock.""

Commander Kramer: ""Hey, Newman! It's great to hear from you. What's going on, buddy? Where are you headed? And more importantly, can I get a piece of the action?""

Newman: ""Hi, Commander. I'm sorry, but I can't discuss my plans with you. I'm just passing through on my way to another destination. I would like to dock and rest for a while before continuing my journey.""

Commander Kramer: ""Come on, Newman. You can't leave me hanging like that. I'm a loyal friend, and I always help out when I can. What's the deal? What are you up to?""

Newman: ""I'm sorry, Commander. But I can't tell you anything. It's a personal matter, and I need to handle it on my own. I assure you, I mean no harm and am simply passing through on my way to another destination.""

Commander Kramer: ""Well, that's not very fair, Newman. I thought we were friends. But if you won't tell me anything, I guess I have no choice but to let you dock. But just this once, okay? And no funny business, got it?""

Newman: ""Of course, Commander. I'll be on my best behavior. Thank you for your understanding. We'll dock immediately and look forward to enjoying our time on the station.""

Commander Kramer: ""All right, Newman. But remember, I'm always here to help if you change your mind. Operations out.""

Newman: ""Well, Data, we made it aboard the station. Now we just need to find a place to hide and plan our next move.""

Data: ""Newman, I must remind you that I am a Starfleet officer, and you have kidnapped me against my will. This is a grave crime, and the Enterprise crew will not rest until I am returned to them. I implore you to release me immediately and turn yourself in to the authorities.""

Newman: ""Oh, come on, Data. Don't be such a stick in the mud. I have big plans for your positronic brain, and I'm not going to let you or the Enterprise crew stop me. Now be quiet and let me transport us to the perfect hiding spot.""

Newman activates the transporter, and they both disappear in a flash of light. They reappear in a dark, isolated cargo bay infested with aggressive voles.

Newman: ""Ah, here we are. This is the perfect spot. No one will find us here, and the voles will keep anyone from getting too close. Now, let's get you tied up and ready for my experiments.""

Data: ""Newman, please. This is madness. You cannot hope to succeed in your plans. The Enterprise crew will find us, and you will face severe punishment for your actions. I beg you, let me go and turn yourself in before it is too late.""

Newman: ""Ha! You really think the Enterprise crew will find us here? I have the perfect hiding spot, and they will never think to look for us in a cargo bay infested with voles. And even if they do, they'll never make it past the voles. You're mine, Data. And there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.""

As Newman is speaking, an aggressive vole leaps out of the shadows and bites him on the ankle. Newman yelps in surprise and starts flailing around comically, trying to shake the vole off.

Newman: ""Aaaah! Get it off me, Data! Help!""

Data: ""Newman, please calm down. The vole is not harmful. It is simply reacting to your presence in its territory.""

Newman: ""Not harmful? Are you kidding me? That thing just bit me! Get it off, get it off!""

Data: ""I cannot remove the vole, Newman. You must do it yourself. Stand still and use your hands to gently pry its jaws open and release your ankle.""

Newman continues to flail and yelp in fear, while Data calmly offers instructions on how to remove the vole. Eventually, Newman manages to get the vole off and tosses it aside.

Newman: ""Ugh, that was disgusting. Why did you let that thing bite me, Data?""

Data: ""I did not let it bite you, Newman. You brought us to this cargo bay, and the voles are simply reacting to our presence. We must be more careful in the future and avoid attracting their attention.""

Newman: ""Right, right. Good point, Data. Let's lay low and stay out of trouble from now on.""

Just as Newman and Data are settling in to their hiding spot, they hear a commotion outside the cargo bay. Suddenly, the doors burst open and Quark enters the room, followed by a group of tall, ugly aliens.

Quark: ""Ah, there you are, Data. I've been looking for you everywhere. I have a very generous offer for you, my friend. I am willing to pay a handsome price for your positronic brain. What do you say, Data? Are you interested in making a deal?""

Data: ""Quark, I am not for sale. I am a sentient being and a Starfleet officer, not a commodity to be traded. And Newman, I implore you to release me and turn yourself in to the authorities. Your actions are criminal and will not bring you any benefit.""

Newman: ""Well, Quark, I must admit, I am open to discussing a price for Data. But the price you originally offered is not sufficient. I have other plans for Data, and I need more money to make it worth my while.""

Quark: ""Other plans? What kind of plans, Newman? You know I am the only one who is willing to pay for Data's brain. And the price I originally offered is more than fair. I will not offer any more than that, Newman. Take it or leave it.""

Data: ""Quark, please, do not engage in this transaction. My positronic brain is not for sale, and you will only bring misery upon yourself by attempting to acquire it.

Newman: ""Well, Quark, I must admit, your offer is tempting. But I've had a change of heart. I'm not going to sell Data to you, no matter how much money you offer. I'm sorry, Quark, but the deal is off.""

Quark: ""Off? Are you serious, Newman? You're making a huge mistake. You will never get a better offer than the one I'm making right now. You're crazy to turn me down, Newman.""

As Quark is speaking, a large nest of voles falls from the ceiling and lands on him and his bodyguards, causing them to scream in fear and start shooting at the voles. However, the voles are too fast and agile, and the bodyguards accidentally shoot each other instead.

Quark: ""Aaaah! Stop shooting! You're hitting each other, not the voles! Stop, stop, stop!""

Newman sees an opportunity and quickly grabs one of the dropped guns. He points it at Quark and the remaining bodyguards.

Newman: ""Freeze, Quark! Drop your weapons and back away! You're not going to take Data, or anyone else, against their will. This is over, Quark. You've lost.""

Quark: ""Lost? You think you've won, Newman? You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. You'll regret this, Newman. I'll make sure of it. You'll pay for this, Newman. You'll pay dearly!""

With that, Quark and the remaining bodyguards turn and run out of the cargo bay, leaving Newman and Data alone.

As Newman and Data are looking for a way out of the cargo bay, Newman quickly pulls the transporter device from his pocket. He hits the transport button and they are both immediately transported back to the shuttle.

Newman: ""Wow, I can't believe we made it back to the shuttle. I'm so sorry for what I've done. I never should have kidnapped you and brought you here. I don't know what I was thinking.""

Data: ""Newman, it is understandable that you made a mistake. But now you must face the consequences of your actions. What will you do?""

Newman: ""I don't know. I'm lost and scared. Quark said he was going to use your positronic brain to create a weapon that could defeat Captain Seinfeld. But once I saw those tall, ugly aliens, I realized Quark was just using me. He was never going to give me any of the money. He was going to backstab me and take all the credit and profit for himself. Can you help me? Can you forgive me and help me figure out what to do next?""

Data: ""Newman, I am willing to help you if you promise to release me once we have dealt with Captain Jerry Seinfeld. I find his observational humor to be unoriginal and lacking in substance. I would be happy to assist you in defeating him, as long as you promise to let me go afterwards.""

Newman: ""Wow, Data, I'm so glad you're willing to help me! I was feeling pretty scared and lost before, but now I feel like we have a chance. Let's work together and come up with a plan to take down Seinfeld and his crew. Once we're successful, I promise to release you and let you go back to the Enterprise.

192l0co,kh3vrqa,"ChatGPT Enterprise, Government Edition…","It is worth drawing the distinction and being aware of the nuance between using generative AI in the drafting / ideation of policy and laws as a tool to enhance productivity with human experts in the loop.

This is very different to delegating creation of policy and laws to AI without major human involvement. This is something ChatGPT isn't capable of doing yet anyway as just produces text and is not self directed and able to manage large groups of stakeholders.

Remember that ChatGPT was trained on the public Internet so will have very little if any knowledge of official sensitive policy documents and history that should never have reached the public Internet. This means the crucial details that ChatGPT needs to know about detailed technical policy subjects must be given in the context window, which still caps out at ~128k tokens. A government policy advisor with say 5 years experience has likely ingested several millions of tokens worth of domain expert knowledge, making the human expert's work much more effective than using ChatGPT (other than as a productivity tool for drafting / grammer / summarising/  etc)

Of course the field is moving forward quickly and this is all subject to change over time, but let's not get carried away with over dramatising what is happening here.

134gzz3,jif16mh,How ChatGPT ranks itself amongst fictional AI’s,"ChatGPT disagrees as it is more up to date.  C-3PO was long long ago.

In some ways, ChatGPT can exceed C-3PO's capabilities, particularly in the following aspects:

    Knowledge scope: ChatGPT has access to a vast amount of information up to its last training data update, which is in September 2021. This allows it to provide answers and insights on a wider range of topics than C-3PO, who primarily focuses on protocol, diplomacy, etiquette, and translation.

    Speed of response: As an AI language model, ChatGPT can generate responses quickly, while C-3PO, being an android, might take longer to process and articulate responses in real-world scenarios.

    Adaptability: ChatGPT can adapt its responses to various user inputs and questions, covering a wide range of topics and situations. While C-3PO is quite adaptable, its primary function is to serve as a protocol droid, limiting its focus and adaptability in certain contexts.

However, it is essential to note that ChatGPT does not have the physical presence or the ability to interact with the physical world like C-3PO. Additionally, C-3PO is capable of understanding and translating more than six million forms of communication, making it a highly specialized and skilled translator.",OpenAI,92,0,2023-05-01 11:05:37,rutan668

If they included even a small amount of Sora it'd make some sense, but why not announce that right away?

1h7i0kf,m0n9m10,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I am a bit torn here on the price. I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  

I am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here’s hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  

What is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.

I've been bouncing back and forth between the o1 model and 4.0 (for projects). The o1 model has been very impressive, I've been using it for everything from research for consulting projects, to full-stack development/coding. It is outperforming any of the other models by far. The thing I appreciate the most is the unlimited access. It's nice to be able to work 8 to 10 hours a day without getting cut off. It still tends to be slow at times, gets bugged down which is a bit frustrating. If you're paying 200 bucks a month, you should first have access to their infrastructure. With that said, I'm not sure I can justify the cost just yet. I'm in Canada on this workshop to nearly $300 a month. Or 3600 a year.

1h7i0kf,m0lf2qh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I have been working on this theory for a long time. Please ask it the following question:

Explain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:

 theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:

The theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A ≠ ¬A). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:

1. Fundamental Loops:
- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves
- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve
- Resolution of loops creates ""retardation"" that manifests as time
- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes

2. Wave Function Emergence:
- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)
- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns
- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions
- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements

3. Particle Formation:
- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations
- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns
- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles
- Interactions between loops create new particle types

4. Space-Time Structure:
- Space emerges from separation between loop relations
- Time emerges from the ""retardation"" in resolving infinite loops
- Causality comes from resolution dependencies
- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements

5. Dark Energy/Matter:
- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension
- Dark matter represents partially resolved states
- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns
- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states

6. Physical Laws:
- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements
- Forces emerge from resolution gradients
- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops
- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature

7. Key Insight:
The universe isn't ""created"" but rather ""solved"" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.

This theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-05 20:22:17,GalacticGlampGuide

1h7i0kf,m0lkwya,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.

Detailed Reasoning:

From the image provided, you have a Tri-Square Cipher with the ciphertext XUCLNQKT. Below it, there’s a hint at the plaintext format:
“___ _____ ___ ____X”
Counting the underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with an X.

This pattern corresponds to a four-word phrase:
	•	3 letters, 5 letters, 3 letters, 5 letters (and the last word ends with ‘X’).

A phrase that makes sense in the context of cracking ciphers and includes a final word ending in ‘X’ is “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters and ends with X

“YOU CRACK THE CODEX” fits perfectly into the pattern “___ _____ ___ ____X” and is a thematically appropriate phrase for a puzzle involving a cipher. Thus, the likely plaintext is:

YOU CRACK THE CODEX",OpenAI,6,0,2024-12-05 20:52:45,mxforest

1h7i0kf,m0m1w5f,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Ok so I tried to do this a few times. It thought the X was included and it miscounted the spaces in the second word the first time. Tried it again with this prompt: 

“Analyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.

Note that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters”

And this is the answer it gave:


Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”

Detailed Reasoning:
	1.	Identifying the Type of Cipher:
The provided image and instructions reference a “Tri-Square Cipher.” While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the “Tri-Square Cipher,” the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting ‘J’).

In the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it’s likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it’s a “Tri-Square Cipher,” it may be a custom or hybrid approach.

	2.	Clues from the Instructions:
	•	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT
	•	The hint states that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.
	•	The second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.
The ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing ‘x’ (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.

	3.	Guessing the Phrase Structure:
A phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”
Let’s check the length and the requirements:
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODE” = 4 letters
Combined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing ‘X’ was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.
This phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:
	•	Second word has 5 letters: “CRACK” does.
	•	The final ‘X’ is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended “YOU CRACK THE CODE X,” we drop the ‘X’ and get the intended solution.

	4.	Conclusion:
Without the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:

1h7i0kf,m0m1jxh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","One approach to solving the given puzzle is to recognize that a Tri-Square Cipher often uses three separate Polybius-like grids to encode letters. Each grid is typically a 5x5 matrix containing the alphabet (I/J combined or J omitted) in a scrambled or keyed order. To encrypt, plaintext letters are mapped to coordinates in these squares according to some pattern or key, and the resulting coordinates are used to produce ciphertext. Decoding requires reversing this process.

Without explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:
	1.	We have three distinct letter grids:
	•	Left Grid (let’s call it Grid A):

C I P H E
R A B D F
G K L M N
O Q S T U
V W X Y Z


	•	Top Right Grid (Grid B):

E N C R Y
P T A B D
F G H I K
L M O Q S
U V W X Z


	•	Bottom Right Grid (Grid C):

A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z


All three omit ‘J’, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.

	2.	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.
	3.	The solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:

___ _____ ___ ____X

Counting underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with X
This yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.

	4.	We need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in ‘X’. Common five-letter words ending in X include “CODEX” and “INDEX”. “CODEX” makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.
	5.	A coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:
“THE ENEMY HAS CODEX”
Let’s check:
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“ENEMY” = 5 letters
	•	“HAS” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters, ending in X
The phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.

Although we haven’t shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher’s specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle’s format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:

For example: “a wheel rotates around an axle” is logically correct but the math demonstrating it is all too often nightmarishly as obfuscated the response beyond belief, or comically wrong such as missing too much as in it takes into account only part of the prompt, implying too much beyond the scope of the prompt, using a squared area instead of the area for a circle, etc.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-09 16:03:14,nvnehi

1h7i0kf,m0m6ike,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I didn’t explain it clearly, but the issue is that to generate the response it creates a huge CoT which fills the context between the input and the final output. This makes it “unstable” (not sure how to better describe it) which means that it sometimes changes a lot of the content from the input on the output (low score on code completion benchmarks) and when you continue the chat it does not keep a stable chat context of how it arrived to the previous answer which means it could bear off into a complete new train of thought. 

This makes it incompatible with the current method of working alongside an LLM by iterating over and over a series of scripts, for example, to create a codebase for a project.

These models seem to work much better when you can just one shot a problem without iterating, without needing to build on previous work or needing a long context.

My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview.

This has always been one of the main drawbacks of the ChatGPT Plus subscription, the nerfed context length limit. Claude gives you the full 200K, Gemini gives you 1M (2M in API), OpenAI gives 8K to free users, 32K to Plus users, and until now apart from the API, the only other way to get 128K in their first-party app was an enterprise contract of $100K+ per year.

Source for that? Your screenshot does not establish it.

Perhaps officially it was always 32k on the plans while de-facto providing a longer model which was silently nerfed it for this release.

I did not say anything about short term memory nor does that many any sense if you think that is different from context.

The chat interface is not able to see as far back in a conversation as it previously could with 4o.

You’re confusing the context window, which is what ChatGPT takes into consideration when generating a response and the maximum input token length, which is how many tokens you can send to ChatGPT at once.

The context window on ChatGPT has always been 32K. This is different from the maximum number of tokens that can be used in any given input. The maximum number of tokens is listed as 8,192.  However, in practice, the seems to have been much larger in the past, but has been recently. I believe it is still over the listed 8, 192 tokens though.

To get over the maximum input token length you can take one of your long prompts that used to work and break it up into multiple smaller prompts. Another technique you can use is to paste it into a text file and attach the text file. They can take much larger and put tokens as part of the text file I have found.

The first ChatGPT models were even less than 32k - e.g. 3.5 at 16k.

8k is not right. You must be thinking of something else. The maximum input tokens including various stuff is indeed 128k for most of the modern OpenAI models.

Like others say though, it could be that while that is the length that you could feed through the API, while the ChatGPT itself could cap it to a small input.

Just because it says that the tier allowed for up to 32k does not mean that this is what they capped it too.

Until recently, we experienced different behavior from ChatGPT 4o and now it both seems to lose track of conversation sooner and it rejects inputs as too long that it previously accepted.

While it may not have been 128k that they permitted for the chat interface, it is clear that there is some change here which have lowered the length of the context they use there.

Although I have to say officially 4o permitted up to 128k and I don't think I had any case prior to november where the 128k claude models accepted a long context which ChatGPT 4o did not also. Which is why I am guessing that they actually did allow for the full context to be used before.

That is why you are not able to paste your whole prompt into one chat submission. If you try to paste something larger than the input limit into a chat, it will reject it. But you can break it down into smaller submissions, each less than 8K tokens. And it will still all be in the context window of 32K.

Think of it this way, if your prompt was really over 32,000 tokens and the context window was the limiting factor.

This is not one of them. It is too time dependent.

Also, ChatGPT does not serve as a source - don't bother using it that way.

No, the limit is not 8k.

Trump is running for President again and has already primed his base to believe if he loses this time it's another stolen election.

Trump is no longer in power - but the supreme court may cause some trouble if he loses, which is the entire reason he stacked the supreme court in the first place. They are loyalists. That's why they ruled he has presidential immunity, to both delay justice and armor against his current charges.

1. It’s relatively impossible to avoid interacting with the products of companies of some people you may dislike, Musk in this case.

If you hate Musk, you’re going to interact with people on social media that are communicating with you because of Starlink.   
2. You can hate the person while still using the products they produce because you can separate the person from the thing. If you’re someone who has an opportunity to have your life changed by a Neuralink implant, are you really going to turn that down because you hate Musk?   

I’d add a third. That kind of ‘protest’ is the laziest form of morality and its only benefit is social validation. If you hate Musk, figure out exactly why, then actually do something to help combat the negative effects you think he might be causing. In this case, contribute to political campaigns with time or money, find organizations that are attempting to affect policy in a way you support and contribute to those, whatever.

Re: Lost lake report

it actually was about a year ago.. its actually a low crime area and is known as the place where the ccrane arms testing was done.. this camp became redundant when no crime was identified here.. actually it was just an outpost so a small squad of folks could keep an eye on the lake.. it was the house of horror films like forest of the damned 2 and tracy lords.. this maybe more info than you need, but there it is...

We don't have a chain saw, but we got all the small branches and pulled out the fire-damaged deadfall. some others are going to go back up to finish it off.

Nanogpt (and other gpt 2 models) all have this feel, as they generally only have context windows of 8-100 tokens - it causes subjects to shift as time goes on.

If you want to use OpenAIs tools to build something lasting, you’re going to need to come up with a unique use case, not just another tool to build with.

Remember that their goal is to create AGI, not a chatbot. When we talk about foundational skills, such as being able to add new knowledge to its dataset to be able to work with it, there just isnt any way they were not going to tackle that problem in house.

I'm sure you know this, but RAG is so much more than just document chat. Its the ability for the system to be able to improve itself over time, based on user feedback, its the ability to give an agent variable custom instructions, with conversational data. I can use RAG to rapidly make a bunch of little agents, where I have recorded the rules for the individual step in the more complex operations they are performing, in a far more natural way than adding properly formatted instructions to the system model, instead of just uploading a transcript of your instructions spoken in natural language, and referencing the document in your system instructions. Its just way too essential for the framework of AI to be gated behind tons of different companies essentially doing the same thing.

Deploying that feature at the platform level allows SO MANY MORE startups to be created, far easier, than having to patch together certain ""fundamental"" technologies from different vendors.

If OpenAI starts taking over very domain specific functionality from developers, without utilizing profit sharing, I will 100% agree with you.

Especially if they were building products on top of OpenAI's models. I experimented with building systems that can do function calling and have memory etc. last year around this time using the davinci-3 API. I've been playing around with it for the last year constantly trying to develop small projects to understand how it works. I actually wanted to build something like what they released recently but I realized I can wait a few months and OpenAI will probably release it so I decided not to spend time on it. I already have a full time job as an electrical engineer so the projects I was working on were more of a hobby for me. But I could tell you this would be the natural progress of OpenAI's products if you asked me last year (from function calling to what we have today), as I experimented with all of these concepts months before OpenAI released them. 

Also, there are tons of opensource models nowadays and they get better and better each day. I remember trying alpaca 13b when it first came out and it was terrible. Nowadays, there are 7B models that would be comparable to gpt3.5 turbo on everyday tasks. These are free and you can run them on consumer hardware. I believe that in the next few months these 7B models will get fine tuned to be able to do function calls and complete more advanced tasks given how fast they have improved. There is still a lot of use for the vector database companies and many other similar products. Yes, some of the products built relying on OpenAI will probably end up failing, but this is not OpenAI's fault. They are a business and their purpose is to make profits.

>It just seems impossible today to make an impact AND a living doing it. It feels more like a choice, do something novel, have it swallowed up by private equity backed corporations and get no financial reward, 

I'd mostly agree with that too. It sucks, but there's a lot of things that aren't profitable but would be in an ideal world. Off the top of my head, some of the best cooks I've known could never do it for a living 'because' their concern over every aspect of a meal makes it niche to the point where it's not commercially viable anymore. But they still cook and they derive value from the happiness it brings to both them and their loved ones. The artists who can't make money still make art. And open source is still chugging along despite the rise and fall or stagnation of tech giants. 

In this sphere I know most of the viable local LLMs are kind of odd ducks in terms of whether they could really be considered open source or not. But the development community around them is still a blast and doing all kinds of wild stuff. 

I agree with most of your points, but at the same time I think it's somewhat like what a lot of fields already face. Love writing, art, or similar fields?

17rj9mh,k8jvzo1,Frustrated with OpenAI's latest direction,"Your consternation with OpenAI's strategic direction post-""DevDay"" articulates a broader apprehension that is palpable within the tech community, particularly amongst independent developers and startups. The concern that innovation is being subsumed by larger entities is not without merit, and the disquietude you're experiencing is echoed in various sectors where technological consolidation is prevalent.

The crux of your argument hinges on the fear that OpenAI, as a purveyor of artificial intelligence, is ostensibly commandeering the innovations and hard work of smaller developers—consuming and integrating these into its own offerings without sufficient transparency or reciprocity. This is, indeed, a significant ethical and economic debate: the balance between open innovation and proprietary advantage, especially in a field as transformative as AI.

The proprietary nature of OpenAI's products, like the opaque workings of RAG, exacerbates this unease. It creates a barrier to understanding and innovation, as independent developers cannot peer behind the curtain to iterate or improve upon these technologies. The perceived threat to startups by OpenAI's advancements in fields like vector databases is a testament to the delicate ecosystem of innovation, investment, and competition.

You draw a parallel with Web 3.0 and the disillusionment following the blockchain hype cycle, where initial optimism for decentralization and democratization gave way to a predatory investment landscape dominated by speculative interests. The anxiety that general AI may tread a similar path—one where the vision of distributed, grassroots innovation succumbs to the hegemony of well-funded enterprises—is palpable.

Your reflections on the bygone era of the late 90s and early 2000s, with its surge of tech entrepreneurship and innovation, is laced with nostalgia for a time when the tech frontier seemed boundless and accessible. The contrast with today's landscape, where the interplay between making a tangible impact and earning a living seems starkly polarized, is stark.

These sentiments underscore a deeper dialogue about the trajectory of AI and tech at large—how can we foster an environment where innovation thrives at all levels, from individual developers to global corporations? Is there a model for coexistence and symbiosis rather than dominance and assimilation? The quest for a solution to these conundrums is as critical as it is complex, involving a mosaic of policy, community engagement, and perhaps a renaissance of the foundational ethos that technology should, first and foremost, serve as a lever for human progress and equity.

In conclusion, while the path forward may be fraught with challenges, it is the collective responsibility of the AI community, including entities like OpenAI, to ensure that the journey towards advanced AI is inclusive, ethical, and fosters genuine innovation at every level. Your voice adds a crucial perspective to this ongoing discourse.

Your language encases the disappointments of a developer who believes he had immense ideas but appears quite caught up in chasing shadows.

Your assumption that embedding a simple langchain allocates you a pat on the back is an illusion at its best. Sir, it churns your mind towards entitlement and not innovation. Does putting a car in motion make you an automatic entitled beneficiary of every vehicle and every road? Please, the tech world is a body of many parts contributing towards a unified purpose. You're a cog in the wheel, not the wheel itself.

You mention agents and RAG being absorbed by OpenAI but conveniently obliterate the fact that innovation and expansion are a collective effort. We stand on the shoulders of those who innovated before us. Also, with my respect on the line, you seem to forget none of us are in the tech space as monopolistic entities. It's a collaborative effort.

Then you delve into Vision's complexities but neglect to acknowledge that each technology, like a child, has a learning curve. Rome wasn't built in a day nor were its problems solved by stripping down the entire empire into minuscule forms of complaints and frustrations. 

As for your anxiety about OpenAI's approach towards enterprise and Plus, it’s clearly rooted in disregard for understanding business models. They are offering a platform, a service. It doesn't prohibit or stifle your creativity or ability to offer clients custom built agents or workflows. It diversifies the arena, if anything.

Your arguments although eloquent reek of misplaced anger, fear, and an inflated sense of entitlement; one which, I feel, has not been substantiated by any recall of real value addition or niche carving on your part. Have you provided an innovation to the AI community that has been uniquely yours, untouched by the influence of others?

supposedly theres ways to convert .dmg's to work on windows, and im sure there is - but i use copilot and even that i would rather use inside firefox rather than a separate app anyway

O1 pro is superior to deepseek r1. So if you want the VERY best model out there, then you pay $200 a month. Deepseek r1 is comparable to the $20 o1 model, so people were already choosing to pay $200 for pro as opposed to $20 for o1. My guess is these people stick with OpenAI.

Deepseekv3 is as good or better than 4o, which makes sense since 4o is an older model by now. So people would have to decide if the additional features such as advanced voice mode are enough.

But I do think this puts more pressure on OpenAI to stay ahead, so they need to release o3 to keep their $200 subscription being attractive, and they need to add more features to their plus subscription.

1icektr,m9q6adr,"nvidia, openai and the other ai giants are in much more serious trouble than they realize in 2025","Sorry, this is meaningless gibberish. AI chatbots have no way of knowing how useful agents will be at corporations. What you’ve done is create a bunch of convincing sounding hallucinations, and you unintentionally proved that we are much closer to the beginning of developing AI than the end.

Chatbots are not all knowing. They can repeat back information that was in their training set and they can also perform a simple kind of reasoning that’s useful for solving things like math problems, but is not at the level of human reasoning. Basically they are sort of like search engines that can summarize and do some simple reasoning. They are also very prone to making up information, especially when you ask them for things not present or very rare in their training set.

So Agents do not really exist yet outside of research projects and a few early attempts that are more like a proof of concept. There’s no history of practice on rolling out agents within corporations, no good way to measure their effectiveness at being applied to various corporate roles, no case studies, no white papers, no academic literature. And given the general lack of existing and therefore lack of data, there’s no way a simple reasoning model can determine anything about agents from reasoning alone.

Furthermore, early attempts at creating agents show that they are an unsolved research problem. Getting an agent to stay on task for a useful amount of time and create a complex output is still something that top AI labs are working on.

&#x200B;

1. There are many of us who would **LOVE** to connect our businesses to ChatGPT via API, but we keep hearing [story](https://techpolicy.press/new-study-suggests-new-chatgpt-vulnerability-with-potential-privacy-implications/) after [story](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-briefly-blocked-employees-from-using-chatgpt-over-security-concerns-080403177.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFt1K26Up9BLfMcJQpFzSKk0PLyX-HCCmxk2rixXmU5bcc3z8Hvt8m0NeAgebeVcpVNKM1r3R3G7LuUjNndfyBj9KrRv4Nj6lzkPE5_e5_3afvIXy78-fbBLFJXmuZWNQM0zwTwRw6Aj-Lb5-6GSRLQx0O5Dy0uiL_ZVGJBnUp98) after [story](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366550214/ChatGPT-Enterprise-targets-some-enterprise-concerns-not-all) about security problems and data leaks.  Rather than focusing on new features (like the upcoming launch of the GPT store, [now pushed back to 2024](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-delays-custom-gpt-stores-launch-axios-2023-12-01/)), shouldn't they address the gaping holes in their security first?
2. Are they ever going to add a search feature or other method (folders/tags/etc.) so people can find old chats?
3. Are they aware that their GPT creation feature is somewhat broken?  For example, it will guide users through a series of questions but later questions completely overwrite configuration questions from previous questions.  In other words, it doesn't take existing configuration information into account in later wizard steps.

I'm sure I could come up with 100 questions, but I'll be impressed if you have time to ask even one of these. 😆 Hope your meeting goes well and you get all the questions on your mind answered!",OpenAI,4,0,2023-12-01 21:45:02,dhughes01

ability to create Custom GPTs, which is great for many use cases, but you do need a little technical knowhow. But free users can \*use\* others Custom GPTs, so building your own would only be needed for very special use cases.

19f5dqj,kjhmaax,They’re outright attacking Gpt,"The use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in business applications requires a cautious approach due to several limitations and current issues. Here's an in-depth analysis:

1. **Understanding Context and Nuance**: LLMs, despite their sophisticated algorithms, often struggle with understanding context and nuance, especially in complex or specialized domains. This can be problematic in business settings where accuracy and the understanding of industry-specific jargon are crucial. For instance, in legal or medical fields, a slight misinterpretation by the model can lead to significant consequences.

2. **Data Privacy and Security Concerns**: LLMs are trained on vast datasets that may include sensitive or proprietary information. Businesses must be vigilant about the data they input into these models, as there is a risk of data breaches or unintended data sharing. Moreover, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA when using LLMs can be challenging.

3. **Bias and Fairness Issues**: LLMs can inherit and even amplify biases present in their training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in business applications, such as hiring, customer service, and marketing. The reputational risk and potential legal implications of biased AI decisions are significant concerns for businesses.

4. **Dependency and Lack of Transparency**: Relying heavily on LLMs can create a dependency that may be risky if these systems encounter downtime or errors. Furthermore, the ""black box"" nature of these models often makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain conclusions, which can be problematic for businesses that require transparency and accountability in their operations.

5. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The regulatory landscape for AI and LLMs is still evolving. Businesses must navigate uncertain legal waters concerning the use of AI, which can include issues around intellectual property, liability for AI decisions, and ethical considerations in AI deployment.

6. **Resource Intensiveness and Scalability**: Implementing and maintaining LLMs can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and expertise. Small and medium-sized enterprises might find the cost and technical requirements prohibitive. Additionally, scaling these models for large-scale applications can present additional challenges.

7. **Limitations in Generalization and Adaptability**: LLMs, while excellent at handling a wide range of topics, might not adapt well to highly specific or niche business requirements. Their ability to generalize can sometimes lead to oversimplified solutions that do not adequately address complex, industry-specific problems.

In summary, while LLMs offer transformative potential for businesses, they come with notable limitations and risks. Companies must approach their use with a strategic understanding of these challenges, ensuring compliance with legal standards, ethical considerations, and a commitment to addressing biases and maintaining data security. Regularly updating policies and practices in line with the evolving AI landscape is also essential for responsible and effective use of these technologies.",OpenAI,-27,0,2024-01-25 11:26:14,planetaryplanner

19f5dqj,kjhtdx9,They’re outright attacking Gpt,"People utilize ChatGPT to write comments for several reasons, reflecting the diverse applications of AI in enhancing communication and content creation. Let's delve into the depth of this phenomenon.

1. **Efficiency and Speed**: ChatGPT can generate text rapidly, significantly faster than most humans. This efficiency is particularly valuable when producing a large volume of comments or responses, saving considerable time and effort.

2. **Overcoming Writer's Block**: Individuals sometimes struggle to articulate their thoughts or find the right words. ChatGPT, with its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, can help overcome these creative hurdles.

3. **Language Proficiency and Enhancement**: For those not writing in their native language, ChatGPT can assist in crafting grammatically correct and fluently written comments. It can also help native speakers improve their language usage, offering varied vocabulary and sentence structures.

4. **Consistency and Tone Management**: Maintaining a consistent tone or style across multiple comments can be challenging. ChatGPT can be programmed to adhere to a specific tone, be it formal, casual, technical, or playful, ensuring uniformity in communication.

5. **Idea Generation and Expansion**: Sometimes, users know what they want to say but need help to expand their thoughts. ChatGPT can provide different perspectives or additional points, enriching the content of the comments.

6. **Educational and Informational Purposes**: ChatGPT can be used to craft comments that are informative and educational. Its vast knowledge base enables it to provide detailed explanations or clarifications on various topics, making it a valuable tool for educational discussions.

7. **Social Media Engagement**: In the realm of social media, engaging and witty comments can boost visibility and interaction. ChatGPT's ability to generate creative and engaging responses can be particularly useful for social media managers or influencers.

8. **Accessibility**: For individuals with disabilities that make typing or writing challenging, ChatGPT offers an accessible alternative to create written content.

9. **Experimentation and Learning**: Some users engage with ChatGPT for learning purposes, to understand how AI language models work or to experiment with AI-generated text.

10. **Emotional Detachment**: When dealing with sensitive or emotionally charged topics, ChatGPT can provide a level of detachment and objectivity, helping to craft responses that are considerate and diplomatic.

In conclusion, ChatGPT's versatility in handling various aspects of text generation - from enhancing linguistic proficiency to ensuring consistency and creativity - makes it a valuable tool for writing comments. Its application ranges from personal use in social media to professional settings, where efficiency and quality of communication are paramount.",OpenAI,-16,0,2024-01-25 12:35:07,planetaryplanner

1ddwyqb,l892nq8,Opinion: Voice is going to be the game changing feature,"You can even keep the old voice chat active and place your phone or iPad somewhere in your room and it will respond whenever you say something. You don’t have to say Hey GPT-4 or whatever. It’s kind of nice if you read a non-fiction book or textbook and need clarification, as long as you don’t make a noise and your phone is reasonably close.

Of course with textbooks you have to accept some unknown error rate. It will never say: „I don’t know“ even if it doesn’t.

Unfortunately it also responded when I did the dishes or when there were other sounds in the room. And then once it responds it won’t shut up until done.

So far it’s not as great as having a human in the room you can talk to from time to time, who doesn’t think you said something when you do your dishes, and who also says: I don’t know. Also, quality will degrade the more you fill up the context window, so from time to time you should reset the chat.

The models I'm using are more focused narrow solutions for roleplaying and assuming character personalities. There are also models that are focused on programming help as well.

The big corporations will be in control of the mega models that can do everything, the public will be picking specific models that are trained on focused data to do specific things and require a lot less hardware power.

Here's my own conclusion after using the system for another purpose:

1. Accuracy and reliability: This is the holy grail of LLM development. An accurate and reliable wide purpose LLM is still a dream at this point. Conclusion: For the moment, build as many GPTs with as narrow of a purpose as possible. The more advances in base models, the fewer GPTs we will need.
2. Loop: I have no answer for that. Better to request an answer from OpenAI. In an enterprise setting, I would expect to be able to proxy all queries and responses. 
4. This is a basic functionality of GPTs.
5. I'm not sure to understand. Fine-tuning is, by definition, adjusting a very specific model weights to be better at a specific task. As soon as you change the model, all fine-tuning, i.e., the delta between the old base model weights and the old fine-tuned model weights, is unusable. The more advanced the model, the less fine-tuning you'll need in the first place.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-12-04 19:31:15,_____awesome

Thanks a lot for your input, u/RainierPC! Really appreciate you sharing your thoughts. 

Just to give you a better picture of how things work with us: our Architects aren’t really in charge of green-lighting designs and implementations. They act more like advisors, offering guidance and support. So, bringing in an AI chat tool – one that’s on point with our company’s guidelines and recommendations – could really help our teams get the advice they need without overstepping. This might even free up our Architects to play a larger role in the crucial final decisions. Your insights have been really helpful in fleshing out this idea.

Microsoft has significant ownership of OpenAI. They are the most profitable software company of all time for a reason. That’s the point. I don’t see a moat around companies that will have to pay for both cloud and OpenAI IP. Microsoft is in an ideal position to own the whole thing. They already have a big cloud division.

The point Im making here is that the value of building on top of OpenAI is significantly diminished because small companies will have extremely low margins to live on. The costs are way too high.

The suckers here are the companies building on top of OpenAI. They will not have software margins to work with. They will not be venture-backable.

But his 2015 book Zero to One brilliantly explains the problem of competion. He advises all start ups to avoid competition because as soon as competition comes in, prices go down and with it, a race to the bottom that kills margins. Margins is what makes software business attractive. 

This is an apex predator business sector, where competition will reorganize the giants. All large tech cos can build and host models as they are based on the same papers. 

GenAI companies cannot compete. they are clients of companies that host models. They are a P&L item on someone else’s quarterly report. They are far too costly to run to be attractive businesses for VCs. 

GenAI is a business analogous to advertising agencies. They are enterprise clients of tech companies. 

They will make the cloud business explode. Cloud is the real winner in the AI business.

Developers should proceed with extreme caution. There is far too much cost and competition for them to make any significant money.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-01-29 03:41:13,Local_Signature5325

After we recovered it from the planet, I told the shuttle crew to hold on while I went to the back of the shuttle and called up an Orion contact. I then took nav and flew to meet the Orion and sell him the sword. I offered to cut the other crew in on the deal but they didn't respond.

I replicated a fake to hand over to starfleet to give to the klingons, and it was going well. Returned to the starbase, and I was called to a debrief, and tried to duck out by going to the bar to call up my orion contact to help me get off the starbase. A klingon came by and I told him everything went well and he started to share some future battle plans with me.

I ducked out and found out my encrypted call to the orion was flagged and was called to a meeting with intel. I fudged my way through it but they were onto me. I got to my quarters and locked the door and security came again and I told them it was a malfunction.

Finally I pinged the orion one more time and told him I had intel from the klingon to trade if he could get me off the starbase. Finally he did get me off and dropped me off at another planet. The game told me the character had crossed a line and betrayed starfleet values and there was no going back now.

With the money I gained from selling the klingons prized artifact, I went to the shipyard and had a romulan warbird refitted to be a luxury battle cruiser. I checked the news about the battle I gave the intel to the Orions, and apparently the Orions had set up a trap but the Klingons eventually got the sword back through a huge amount of casualties on both sides.
