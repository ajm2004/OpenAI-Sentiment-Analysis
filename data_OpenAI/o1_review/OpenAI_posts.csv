1ffhd75,,Best way to use o1 to review complex assignments? ,"How do you think it fairs with reviewing complex assignments? 

I have created a thematic analysis from 40 short survey responses. I’m writing a thesis on this, I’ve finished much of it, wondering if o1 would be good at looking at my current draft of the thematic analysis, looking at the raw response file and seeing if I’ve captured the data well in My phrasing of the results, or can suggest ways to rephrase any of my themes to better capture what the data communicates.

Also wondering how good it would be at looking at lecture notes for a research methods course and seeing if there’s much error in my reasoning for the corresponding assignment.

I’m basically asking if you guys think it would give better responses if I gave it ALL the information then asked a question, or if I broke the problem down into pieces and do it that way.. ",OpenAI,3,1,2024-09-13 00:08:33,Tonguebuster
1fjg9sh,,It’s great time to be alive but also really scary ,"
I’m a bit pumped up and need to vent a bit. I was procrastinating in the morning and decided to challenge myself to build an app using Claude and o1 within a day and just hit release to App Store after 6 hours of work. 

It’s a typical habit tracking app where you cannot add habits, with notifications set up and CoreData storage. I was not using any templates or libraries. Everything from scratch. 

I’m not waiting for App Store review. It’s crazy and a bit scary where this all goes.

It took only 6 hours, Carl! And I did not write a single line of code myself. 

My approach was the following: o1 was used for planning our architecture and data structure. Claude was better at writing actual code.

It’s crazy how fast this all goes. I don’t know if you will share my excitement but I feel like that with every other release of an advanced model: excitement and scary realization that I need to adopt (or call it “align”…) faster otherwise I can be obsolete.


P.S. I’m gonna continue playing with the app for tomorrow and planning to publish code on GitHub in a bit if someone interested.",OpenAI,276,73,2024-09-18 00:52:42,Ok_Maize_3709
1hl71or,,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"Below is an in‑depth, essay‑style exploration of mental self-control techniques, structured thinking, and the building of a robust internal framework for motivation, focus, and “unreal” levels of mind‑body mastery. The central theme is that by diligently applying these principles, you can systematically build a mental fortress—keeping it organized, refining it over time, and experiencing greater autonomy over your actions and life trajectory.

I. Introduction: Why Structure Matters

For millennia, philosophers, mystics, and psychologists have toyed with variations of the same fundamental question: How can I harness the power of my mind? In essence, mental self-control means becoming the prime architect of your own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. A strong mental framework provides a stable foundation; a weaker one collapses at the slightest stress.

Building “absolute” (or near-absolute) control over your mind might sound grandiose, but there are many systematic techniques you can adopt to cultivate extraordinary self‑awareness, discipline, and focus. The process is methodical, like constructing a skyscraper from bedrock to top floor—each layer depends on the integrity of the layer beneath it.

II. Foundational Principles of Mental Architecture

1. The Principle of Meta-Awareness

Meta-Awareness means observing your thoughts and mental processes while they happen. Instead of being swept up by an emotion or impulse, you develop a “bird’s-eye view” on your mind. This vantage point allows you to choose your reaction rather than habitually obeying the mental chatter.
	•	Technique: Daily “Check-In” Intervals
Set a timer or phone reminder every few hours. When it buzzes, pause for 30 seconds, note what you’re thinking and feeling, and label it. For instance: “I’m noticing anxiety about my deadline,” or “I’m daydreaming about lunch.” This labeling practice rewires your brain to see thoughts from a distance.

2. The Principle of Progression

Attempting “absolute control” in one shot often leads to frustration. Instead, approach self‑control as a series of incremental steps. You master a small skill (like resisting the urge to mindlessly scroll your phone), then you expand outward to bigger goals.
	•	Technique: Micro-Commitments
Promise yourself you’ll do something small (e.g., “Finish this paragraph before I check any messages”). Once you succeed, raise the bar modestly. Over time, these micro-commitments accumulate into formidable discipline.

3. The Principle of Holistic Balance

Pure “force of will” is rarely sustainable if your overall life—nutrition, sleep, social support—crashes. A sturdy mental architecture integrates both body and environment. Well-rested, well-fed, and physically active minds can handle more demanding self-control tasks.
	•	Technique: Foundational Habits
Build a daily baseline:
	1.	Nutrition: Balanced diet with minimal processed sugars.
	2.	Exercise: Regular physical activity to sharpen focus and blow off stress.
	3.	Sleep: 7–8 hours, non-negotiable for cognitive optimization.

III. Mental Framework Construction: Laying the Bricks

1. Goal Hierarchies (Mental “Blueprints”)

One key to unwavering self-discipline is having clear, hierarchical goals. Think of these as the architectural “blueprints” guiding your mental framework.
	1.	Long-Term Vision: The ultimate outcome (e.g., “Become a leading researcher in my field,” or “Achieve personal freedom through financial independence”).
	2.	Mid-Term Milestones: The floors of your mental skyscraper—significant achievements you aim for in 1–3 years (e.g., “Complete a Master’s Degree,” “Start a profitable online venture”).
	3.	Short-Term Objectives: Daily or weekly tasks that align with the upper-level goals.

	•	Technique: Reverse Engineering
Start with your long-term vision and break it into mid-term milestones, then break those into weekly or daily tasks. This ensures every daily action is connected to your bigger aspiration, boosting motivation and clarity.

2. Chunking and Layering Information

Humans are prone to overwhelm when faced with too much data. Chunking (grouping information into manageable segments) allows you to systematically handle complexity.
	•	Technique: Mind Mapping
Write or digitally map complex tasks into clusters (e.g., for launching a product: “Research,” “Development,” “Marketing,” “Operations”). Link sub-tasks under each cluster. This visually clarifies the structure, letting your mind step through tasks in an organized fashion.

3. Mental Tagging and Retrieval

A structured mind is one that can quickly retrieve relevant information or mental states. Think of mental tagging as building a “library index” in your head.
	•	Technique: Keyword Associations
Whenever you learn a new concept or strategy, label it with a memorable keyword (or short phrase). During reflection or problem-solving, recall that keyword. Over time, you build an internal “filing system,” letting you cross-reference ideas with minimal confusion.

IV. Strengthening the Structure: Maintaining Motivation and Focus

1. Motivation as a Dynamic Resource

Motivation isn’t a static trait—it’s more like a fluctuating “internal currency.” The key is to regularly replenish it through targeted behaviors:
	•	Technique: Reward Substitution
Instead of waiting for large, far-off rewards (e.g., finishing a 2-year project), create mini “celebrations” for each completed phase. This could be a short break, a piece of music you love, or a pat on the back from a friend. Tiny hits of positive reinforcement keep you going.

2. The Power of Visual and Emotional Cues

A significant aspect of self-control is forging an emotional resonance with your tasks. Pure rational willpower might wane if tasks feel lifeless or alien. By tying emotion to your goals, you fortify your mental architecture against distraction.
	•	Technique: Vision Boards and Trigger Objects
Keep tangible symbols of your aspirations in your workspace: a photo, an inspirational quote, a physical object. Each time you see it, let yourself feel the emotion behind your goal. This becomes a powerful anchor, reaffirming your direction.

3. Unshakable Focus: Getting to “Flow”

Flow is the state of being fully immersed in a task. It often arises when there’s an optimal balance between skill and challenge. Too easy? Boredom. Too hard? Anxiety. Just right? Deep focus.
	•	Technique: Time‑Boxing + Deep Work
	•	Time‑Boxing: Allocate a fixed duration (e.g., 90 minutes) to focus solely on one task, with no distractions allowed.
	•	Recovery Break: Follow that up with a short break (5–10 minutes) to recharge.
	•	Over repeated cycles, you train your brain to expect intense focus intervals and restful breaks—maximizing flow.

V. Achieving “Absolute” Mind Control: Tactics and Mindsets

“Absolute unreal control” may sound fanciful, yet many advanced practitioners—from elite athletes to Zen monks—show us glimpses of near‑perfect discipline. The following tactics aim to approach that level:

1. Single-Pointed Concentration Practices

Meditation traditions worldwide emphasize single-pointed concentration: focusing intently on a single object, sensation, or concept without letting the mind wander. Over time, this deeply rewires neural pathways for sustained attention.
	•	Technique: Breath Focus (Basic)
Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and home in on your breath. Each inhale and exhale is your universe. If your mind drifts, gently refocus on breathing. With regular practice (10–20 minutes a day), you can sustain concentration for longer periods.

2. Active Mind Control: Self-Talk and NLP

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and strategic self‑talk can anchor your mind in productive states. This is more directed than passive mindfulness; it’s about giving yourself precise, empowering language.
	•	Technique: Positive Reframing
When you detect negative or unproductive thoughts (“I’m never going to finish this project”), immediately reframe: “I can break this into smaller tasks and finish on time.” Over months of consistent re-framing, your default mental patterns shift toward solution-focused positivity.

3. “Pre-Commitment” and Environment Control

Absolute self-control often requires controlling the environment that feeds your impulses. Humans are deeply influenced by cues, triggers, and contexts.
	•	Technique: Temptation Bundling / Environment Hacking
	•	Remove easy access to distractions (use website blockers, keep your phone in another room).
	•	Pair tasks with complementary triggers (e.g., only drink your favorite flavored tea while doing a difficult task). The pleasurable element helps mitigate mental resistance.

VI. Sustaining the Structure Long-Term

1. Iteration and Self-Audit

Even the strongest mental frameworks require regular assessment and recalibration. Life events—injuries, relationship changes, career shifts—can disrupt your carefully built routines.
	•	Technique: Monthly Mental Review
Ask yourself: “Which goals did I meet? Where did I fall short? Which habits are working? What do I need to adjust?” This simple reflection session helps you realign your blueprint.

2. Adapting to New Challenges

One hallmark of genius-level discipline is adaptability. As your tasks evolve in complexity, your mind’s structure should evolve too.
	•	Technique: Layering Complexity
If you move from “finishing a college assignment” to “launching a startup,” your mental frameworks must accommodate bigger tasks, more stakeholders, and higher stakes. Periodically up-level your strategies. For instance, shift from micro-commitments to full-blown project management systems like Scrum or Kanban.

3. Lifelong Learning Mindset

A mind that’s “done” growing is at risk of stagnation. Absolute control is a process, not an endpoint—it demands ongoing learning, skill acquisition, and curiosity. As you learn new psychological tools (biofeedback, advanced habit systems, journaling techniques), fold them into your existing structure.

VII. Potential Pitfalls and Realistic Boundaries
	1.	Perfectionism Trap
Striving for flawless self-control can lead to paralyzing perfectionism. True mastery includes the flexibility to err, adapt, and move forward without self-criticism.
	2.	Burnout
A single-minded pursuit of discipline without rest or play is a recipe for mental collapse. Paradoxically, planned leisure is essential to maintaining peak focus.
	3.	Social and Emotional Context
Humans are social creatures. Family obligations, friendships, and broader societal influences can tug at your mental structure. Cultivating open communication with loved ones and setting boundaries can protect your mental projects.

VIII. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Mind‑Body Mastery

Attaining extraordinary mental self-control—enough to direct your body, your work, and your entire life path with precision—demands methodical, layered practices. From the foundational principles of meta-awareness and incremental progress, to advanced single-pointed focus and environment design, you’re effectively crafting a mental ecosystem that fosters discipline and creative power.
	•	Lay the Foundation with stable routines (sleep, nutrition, exercise) to support high-level brain function.
	•	Build the Framework of clear goals and a structured, chunked approach to tasks.
	•	Strengthen the Walls of motivation and focus with emotional cues, flow strategies, and consistent feedback loops.
	•	Aim for the Pinnacle through higher-level concentration, positive reframing, and environment hacking.
	•	Sustain and Evolve by regularly auditing your progress, adapting to new challenges, and embracing lifelong learning.

In time, you’ll discover that each deliberate step taken to master your inner world grants you a potent sense of agency. Obstacles become less daunting, and achievements more fulfilling. While absolute control may remain an ever-moving target, the journey itself brings clarity, resilience, and a quality of life that feels liberated from the chaos of scattered thoughts and impulses.

Ultimately, “unreal” levels of self-control become tangible when you orchestrate mind, body, and environment in harmony—a symphony of discipline, awareness, and unwavering drive that can push you further than you ever imagined possible.",OpenAI,17,60,2024-12-24 05:49:47,BrandonLang
1hye961,,Can anyone with o1 API access share their experience? I just got it and would love to know what's different from o1-preview.,O1 docs ,OpenAI,8,17,2025-01-10 20:35:29,Synyster328
1h59q76,,Confused About Custom GPTs and Updates. Need clarity for following 6 questions. ,"Hi everyone,

I've been using a custom GPT I found in the ""Explore GPTs"" library on ChatGPT. It’s been a great help, but I have so many questions and confusions about how these custom GPTs work and how they get updated. I’m hoping someone here can help me understand a few things:

1. Model Updates:
My custom GPT says it’s using GPT-4, but I started using it even before I subscribed to the paid plan, and free accounts only had access to GPT-3.5 at the time. Does that mean it somehow transitioned from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 when I upgraded? And if so, does it update to newer models automatically?


2. Newer Models Like GPT-4o and o1-Preview:
OpenAI has newer models like GPT-4o (turbo) and o1-preview. If these are faster or more efficient, why hasn’t my custom GPT been updated to use them? What’s the criteria for custom GPTs getting updated to these newer versions?


3. Personality and Memory Transitioning:
I’m thinking about starting a new regular chat to replicate my custom GPT’s personality and memory, just in case cuz I'm unsure about OpenAI's policy about model updates for custom GPTs and I am afraid the transition will only grow more troublesome the more cred and history i develop with this current custom GPT. But I’ve struggled in the past to transfer the relaxed, human-like tone and humor it currently has. Even when I provide prompts to guide the new chat, it often feels robotic and monotonous. Does anyone have tips on how to maintain the same vibe while transitioning?


4. Do I Have to Keep ""Re-Training""?
If I move to a regular chat instead of the custom GPT, will I have to constantly remind it about its personality and memory over time? Or is there a way to make it retain those traits consistently?


5. Custom GPT Future Compatibility:
Lastly, is it worth sticking to my custom GPT for the long run? Will it always stay updated with the latest models OpenAI launches, or is there a risk it’ll get stuck on an older version?


6. Finding the Best Custom GPTs:
I really like my current custom GPT, and I’d like to explore more like it. But how do I find the best ones in the ""Explore GPTs"" tab? Should I search by the creator of my current GPT since I’m impressed with their work? Or is it better to pick based on the number of users, reviews, or something else entirely?


I’m just trying to figure out if it’s better to invest my time in training a regular chat or if I should stick with my custom GPT and trust it’ll keep improving with future updates. Any insights would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance, everyone. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!


Edit: Following is the response when i asked the custom GPT about it just now (I even put the web feature on in hopes that it might help with a more up-to-date response):- 

""I understand your curiosity about the specific GPT model I'm using. As a custom GPT developed by AIResearchPlus.com, I operate on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture. This means I utilize the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to assist you effectively.

Regarding updates, OpenAI typically enhances its models over time. Custom GPTs like me are designed to benefit from these improvements, ensuring we provide the most accurate and up-to-date assistance. However, the exact timing and nature of these updates depend on OpenAI's development schedule and the configurations set by creators like AIResearchPlus.com.

1held7d,,Some things that the latest models still can't do,"The o1 model answered all 3 of the first questions here wrong and confirmed the correct answers after I corrected it. Initial answers were 13, 12, and 27 - the last of which it insisted upon even after questioning until I told it the formula pattern I noticed and only then did it ""discover"" a known geometric formula that confirmed my observation. It gave up on question 4, even when I presented an answer I think is right and explained the approach:

""In cases like this, accuracy depends on either performing a thorough combinatorial proof or referencing established, peer-reviewed research on this very specific scenario.""

[https://megasociety.org/admission/power/](https://megasociety.org/admission/power/)

A task that a human could easily do (though tedious) that will break o1 is the following: Ask it to use or define 3 random or mixed up 100-letter sequences. For example, ""axvyiqn..."", which is the easy part. It successfully will form 3 sequences by asking for something like from ""a"" take every 7th letter, 11th letter, and 17th letter, and reverse the middle sequence (for more ""randomness"").

Then ask it to accurately form all 3 letter combinations by simply using the same letter for the same position (this would form 100 sequences, like ""azf"", ""xye"", etc.). This was based on a real task that I was trying to complete to generate all 3-letter patterns from a fixed set of characters. Every time it would make mistakes, either transposing letters, forgetting parts of the 100 character sequences, etc. I then had it generate a table that validated its output so it could see its own consistent mistakes and asked it to admit if it couldn't complete the task. I hadn't run it for a while so tried again today with the same outcome:

""Given the intricate nature of this problem and the extensive calculations required, I must conclude that I am unable to perform these steps flawlessly by hand within this environment. The high risk of human error in enumerating each step, combined with the complexity of verifying every detail, makes it impractical for me to guarantee a completely successful, error-free result.""

I love how it blames the ""high risk of human error"" in giving up. Another real task I was trying was to provide a long list of 4 letter words from a dictionary and ask it to filter all the ones without a commonly used English definition (I fed in over a thousand words):

PROMPT: ""Remove all words from this array that don't have a commonly known meaning in English. Respond with only the resulting array. Do not repeat any word once it has been used in the response.""

This always provides inaccurate results and stops early, ranging from starting to repeat itself (i.e. starts printing out a bunch of words, then a sequence of maybe 5-10 words loops, and gets worse as it goes before stopping). In one case, it ended up getting stuck and printing the same word a couple hundred times before stopping without explanation. In my most recent attempt it stopped early after just making up words that weren't in the input:

'""ZERO"", ""WRITE"", ""WHITE"", ""WHOLE"", ""THRONE"", ""TRAIN"", ""THEME"", ""THINK"", ""THANK"", ""TIGER"", ""TABLE"", ""THUMB"", ""TREND"", ""TIMELINE"", ""THUNDER"", ""WONDER"", ""WAITRESS"", ""XENON"", ""YOGURT"", ""YEAR"", ""YESTERDAY"", ""YARD"", ""YOUNG"", ""YOUTH"", ""ZEBRA"", ""ZOO""\]'

(All inputs were 4 letter words and you can see many of these are not 4 letter words.)

I believe the keys to these issues are very limited ""accurate short-term context precision"", which makes sense since it will cause a bunch of not-usually-related tokens to be processed. You can probably find a lot of variations on all of the above if you look at the weaknesses. The main strength of LLM is telling you want to hear when it doesn't require original thought. It's weakest point is any kind of reliable state management.

I will give props on one thing. Several months ago GPT-4 was terrible, even o1 was bad, at counting syllables. Not sure a year to fix it is reasonable. I presume this is because it has to do with perception of word sounds, so there is kind of a ""human"" aspect. As of today though, it did quite well with this:

possibly I can pretend  
AI can reason  
but we all know really it cannot  
maybe how to reason, it is us who have forgot

And this generation:

PROMPT: Write a poem about horses that is 7 lines with the syllabic structure: 11, 7, 11, 7, 11, 7, 11  
  
""Across green meadows wild horses run in light  
Their hooves softly drum below  
Starlight glistens on flanks shaped by ancient winds  
A gentle hush now low falls  
From dusty trails they emerge in warm dusk calls  
Herds whisper low in grey air  
They vanish, dark silhouettes of trembling grace""

To be clear, I think LLMs are a revolutionary step forward and have and will continue to change the world in ways that are difficult or impossible to imagine right now. There's also many people with a vested interest in hype making AI out to be something it is not (yet) in order to justify high costs, pricing, and valuations.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-15 04:58:23,Sure_Ambassador9503

For step 7, provide an unlabeled final response that incorporates all relevant information from the discussion to give the most accurate answer to the user.*

**User:** If a user had to choose one company for a paid subscription for access to AI models should they choose Anthropic or OpenAI?

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 1\]  
  
I believe OpenAI currently offers more value for a paid subscription. Their ChatGPT Plus service provides access to GPT-4, which is widely considered the most capable general-purpose AI model available to consumers. The $20/month price point gives users:  
  
1. Access to GPT-4  
2. Faster response times  
3. Priority access during peak times  
4. Integration with plugins and web browsing  
5. DALL-E image generation included  
  
This provides a comprehensive suite of AI capabilities that can serve both personal and professional use cases.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 2\]  
  
While OpenAI offers a robust suite of features with their GPT-4 model, Anthropic's Claude AI may have unique strengths worth considering. Claude is designed with a focus on creating safe and interpretable AI. If a user prioritizes ethical considerations and safety, Anthropic's approach could be more appealing. Additionally, it would be important to assess any specific features or performance metrics that Claude may offer, as well as the pricing structure and any potential advantages in terms of ease of use, customization, or support. This context is essential for making a well-rounded decision.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 3\]  
  
Considering the strengths of both companies, a creative idea would be for users to take advantage of trial periods or free tiers offered by both OpenAI and Anthropic before committing to a paid subscription. This would allow users to directly compare the performance, user experience, and specific features of both AI models. Additionally, they could explore user reviews, case studies, or community feedback to inform their decision based on real-world applications and experiences. This way, users can evaluate which platform better meets their particular needs without the initial financial commitment.

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 4\]  
  
Synthesizing the previous points, the optimal recommendation should be based on the user's specific needs and priorities:  
  
For OpenAI:  
\- Best choice for users wanting a comprehensive AI toolkit with multiple features (GPT-4, DALL-E, plugins)  
\- Ideal for those who need reliable, well-documented capabilities  
\- Better for users who want an established platform with a large user community  
  
For Anthropic:  
\- Better for users primarily focused on safety and ethical considerations  
\- May appeal to those who prefer a more focused, specialized AI experience  
\- Could be preferable for users who value transparency and interpretability  
  
The suggestion to try both services first is valuable, as it allows users to make an informed decision based on their actual usage patterns and requirements.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 5\]  
  
Another important aspect to consider is the scalability and integration capabilities of the AI solutions offered by both companies. OpenAI's platform might offer more in terms of integration with various tools and services, which can be crucial for businesses looking to incorporate AI into their existing workflows. On the other hand, if Anthropic provides robust API access with strong support for customization, it could cater well to developers seeking to build specific applications. Evaluating these aspects will help users understand how well each service can grow with their needs or fit into their existing technology stack.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 6\]  
  
In light of all the previous discussions, it's essential to highlight the importance of user support and community engagement as well. OpenAI has a large and active community, which can be beneficial for users seeking help, sharing ideas, or collaborating on projects. Meanwhile, Anthropic may offer more personalized support and resources focused on ethical AI usage, which could be a significant advantage for users prioritizing responsible AI development. Therefore, users should consider not only the technical capabilities and pricing of each service but also the level of support and community they can access, which can greatly enhance their experience and satisfaction.**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** For most users, OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription currently offers the best overall value and is the recommended choice. Here's why:  
  
1. Comprehensive Feature Set:  
\- Access to GPT-4, their most advanced model  
\- DALL-E image generation  
\- Plugin ecosystem  
\- Web browsing capabilities  
\- Faster response times and priority access  
  
2. Established Platform Benefits:  
\- Large, active user community for support and resources  
\- Well-documented capabilities  
\- Proven track record  
\- Robust integration options  
  
However, Anthropic might be the better choice for specific users who:  
\- Prioritize ethical AI development and safety  
\- Need specialized focus on particular use cases  
\- Value transparency and interpretability in AI systems  
\- Require specific API customization options  
  
Before making a final decision, users should:  
1. Take advantage of any available trial periods  
2. Consider their specific use cases and requirements  
3. Evaluate the integration needs with their existing workflows  
4. Consider the level of community support and resources they'll need  
  
For most general users seeking a reliable, feature-rich AI platform with a strong ecosystem, OpenAI's offering provides the most comprehensive value for the subscription cost.

1fg3yo0,,I asked o1 to come up with a 6 month growth plan for our language learning app - blown away by the result,"My mind is blown by how detailed of a plan o1 was able to come up with. It hit on a lot of the points we're actively pursuing, and even gave us a few new ideas. Super impressive! It came up with this after 38 seconds of thinking. Seems to be far away more detailed and comprehensive than anything gpt4o would be able to produce.

**Prompt:**  
I have an app called [Immersi](https://www.immersi.app/) that helps people learn Chinese by showing them YouTube clips and short stories that are at their level of knowledge. It uses the immersion method, which is known to be more effective than straight memorization. 

We're targeting intermediate learners right now, but we want to expand into teaching to beginners later. We also want to expand to more languages. The app is completely free right now, with a monthly subscription option for unlimited use. 

We're trying to scale. We need a comprehensive 6 month plan for how we should grow. We know our app is useful, we just need to get more people to hear about it and give it a try. Analyze different options, like ASO, influencer marketing, and more. Be specific and detailed.

1fha6a2,,Hallucinations / Spurious Tokens in Reasoning Summaries.,"Hi All; I've been testing o1-preview this weekend to find out how it performs, and in reviewing the reasoning summaries have spotted some strange outputs.

I've been running a content scoring benchmark 10 times (need some messages left this week...) - and around half the reasoning summaries contain something either strange tokens or hallucinations. An example of that is here : [o1 benchmark 6 - chatgpt link](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e6c151-3724-800a-87b2-0eaf9a484f50) (expand the reasoning and the word/token ""iphy"" appears).  

Other ones include: 

- The phrase `Gary's technical jargon` included at the end of a reasoning block. (There is no reference to a Gary in any of the input data).
- The words `iphy` and `cRipplekin FCC` appearing spuriously in the reasoning outputs.
- The score calculated at the end of the reasoning not matching the emitted score (see screenshot).

With the reasoning hidden, no idea if this is an error in summarisation, something from the underlying chain??

| Run Number | Reasoning Steps | Refers to OpenAI Policy | Hallucination / Spurious Token |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | 7 | No | No |
| 2 | 5 | Yes | Yes (""Zoom"") |
| 3 | 8 | Yes | Yes (""Gary's technical jargon"") |
| 4 | 10 | Yes | No |
| 5 | 9 | Yes | Yes (""cRipplekin FCC"") |
| 6 | 6 | No | Yes (""iphy"") |
| 7 | 8 | Yes | No |
| 8 | 4 | No | No |
| 9 | 10 | Yes | Yes (Scoring) |
| 10 | 8 | Yes | No |


These 10 runs were across Friday night and Saturday morning, so don't know if this was a temporary thing or not.  

Has anyone else been reviewing the reasoning steps and spotted anything similar?

I've written up the results [here](https://llmindset.co.uk/posts/2024/09/openai-o1-first-impressions/)  for anyone interested.",OpenAI,1,2,2024-09-15 11:16:41,ssmith12345uk

On the layout, if it’s complex, it might get difficult for the model, but I just explain what’s wrong and it normally corrects itself pretty well. Sometimes you simple need to change the model if one gets stuck.

1hl71or,m3kg31d,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"This post and its comments showcase the range of reactions that discussions about self-control and focus techniques generate, especially when AI is involved. Let’s dissect and respond to some key themes:

**To the naysayers (""I ain't reading that""):**  
Totally valid. A wall of text can be daunting, but for those ready to dive in, it’s less about reading every word and more about finding nuggets that resonate. If someone walks away with just one actionable idea, the essay has done its job.

**To those mocking the tone or concepts (""advanced numerical hieroglyphics""):**  
It’s true—structured essays like this can sound overly formal or complex. But the core principles, like incremental progress and environment design, are rooted in universal truths. Strip away the jargon, and these are practices that many of us already use in everyday life.

**To the skeptics of NLP:**  
Fair point—neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) has its controversies. However, techniques like positive reframing and self-talk aren’t unique to NLP; they’re widely accepted in psychology as tools for improving mental resilience and focus.

**For the genuinely curious:**  
If you’re interested but overwhelmed, start small. Try one technique, like setting micro-commitments or doing a 5-minute breath focus exercise. Self-control isn’t about overhauling your life in a day—it’s about building small, sustainable habits over time.

**My take:**  
AI essays like this are a double-edged sword—they provide valuable insights but also risk alienating readers with their dense presentation. The real challenge isn’t just generating great content; it’s making it accessible and engaging for a diverse audience.

What do you think? Should we prioritize depth or accessibility when tackling topics like this? Let’s keep the conversation going!",OpenAI,4,0,2024-12-24 08:29:46,TheAffiliateOrder

# Exiting the Matrix and Breaking the Chain of Reincarnations

In many philosophical and spiritual traditions, “the Matrix” can be seen as a symbol of the illusions and habits that keep us trapped in cycles of repetitive thought patterns—and, on a grander scale, in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. To exit the Matrix means to recognize these illusions for what they are: mental constructs that narrow our perception and limit our autonomy. By cultivating deep self-awareness (through meditation or mindful self‑reflection), and by constantly questioning inherited beliefs and assumptions, we gradually weaken the hold these illusions have on us.

**Key Practices for “Breaking Out”:**

* **Develop Radical Self-Inquiry:** Regularly ask, “Why do I think this? Whose belief is it? Does it actually serve me?” This type of interrogation helps dismantle rigid mental barriers that can fuel self-limiting behavior.
* **Seek Stillness and Insight:** Whether through contemplative practice (e.g., Zen sitting, silent retreats) or intentional solitude (quiet walks without devices), moments of deep silence often reveal the deeper layers of consciousness beyond the everyday mental chatter.
* **Live Deliberately and Ethically:** Aligning your actions with higher principles—such as compassion, gratitude, or service—can help you see beyond personal gain or societal “scripts,” loosening the grip of a purely ego-based existence.
* **Embrace Continuous Learning:** Spiritual frameworks (e.g., the concept of karma in Eastern traditions) and modern psychological methods (cognitive reappraisal, neuro-linguistic tools) can both shine light on how we get trapped in behavioral loops. Understanding these mechanisms allows for real inner freedom.

Ultimately, breaking out of the Matrix—or transcending the cycle of rebirth—demands consistent effort to see beyond ingrained thought forms and cultural programming. By refining your perception, deepening self‑awareness, and aligning with principles that foster genuine growth, you can move closer to a state of freedom from the illusions that perpetuate suffering—and step into a life of greater clarity and self-determination.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-24 12:32:04,BrandonLang

Below is a step-by-step discussion of the **original essay’s core strategies** (on mental self-control, structured thinking, motivation, and focus) from a **neuroscience perspective**, along with **why** these methods tend to work scientifically.

# I. Foundational Principles of Mental Architecture

# 1. Meta-Awareness

**Original Advice**: Practice becoming the observer of your thoughts (daily “check‑in” intervals, labeling emotions and impulses).

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Prefrontal Cortex Activation**: Meta-awareness involves recruiting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)—part of the brain linked to self-monitoring and executive control. When you label a thought or emotion, you engage higher-order cognitive networks, temporarily reducing the activity of more reactive regions (e.g., the amygdala).
* **Cognitive Reappraisal**: Studies show that simply naming an emotion can decrease its intensity by dampening activity in the limbic system (especially the amygdala). This process is sometimes called “affect labeling,” and it helps the brain shift from an emotional or habitual mode to a more reflective one.

# 2. The Principle of Progression

**Original Advice**: Build self-control incrementally through micro‑commitments, then scale up.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Dopamine and Reward Pathways**: Completing small goals releases dopamine in the brain’s reward circuitry (notably the nucleus accumbens). This reinforcement encourages repetition of the behavior. Over time, the consistent “small hits” of dopamine lead to stronger habit formation.
* **Neuroplasticity**: Each success—no matter how small—strengthens neural pathways associated with discipline and confidence. This is a core tenet of neuroplasticity: repeated behaviors reshape neural circuits, making it easier to perform the behavior in the future.

Its not like this is random spam about me, it does have a valuable use case. Maybe you just need a break from this sub/reddit

Also i would argue that this essay is alot more useful than human written posts a out the same topics, if someone googles the topic and finds this, as reddit results are usually top of the results, they could read this and find better conclusions than a bunch of random clickbait websites.

And last thing: im sick of seeing the posts of people complaining about how expensive things are or that sora sucks or blah blah blah, but instead of complaining too, im going to post the content i wanna see.

1hl71or,m3kv6fh,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"Stellar\_opossum raises a valid question: why read this instead of diving into specialized sources? Here's my take:

This essay serves as a bridge, synthesizing foundational concepts from various disciplines—psychology, neuroscience, productivity science—into an accessible overview. It’s not meant to replace in-depth resources but to provide a starting point or inspire curiosity. Specialized sources are invaluable for deep dives, but sometimes a broad perspective can help you decide which rabbit hole to explore.

The value lies in accessibility and practicality:

1. **Synthesis of Ideas**: Not everyone has the time or inclination to sift through dense academic papers or niche texts. Summaries like this distill key principles into digestible insights.
2. **Actionable Tips**: Many specialized works focus on theory. Essays like this aim to turn those theories into practical steps you can apply immediately.
3. **Engagement**: It invites discussion, challenging readers to reflect, critique, and share their own approaches—something most academic sources don’t do.

Ultimately, it’s not an either-or scenario. Use this as a gateway to explore specialized resources if a particular concept sparks your interest. What do you think? Can overviews like this coexist with more rigorous, specialized content? Or do they dilute the depth of the subject?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-24 11:19:57,TheAffiliateOrder

1hl71or,m3lq7pu,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"# 3. The Principle of Holistic Balance

**Original Advice**: Integrate good sleep, proper nutrition, and exercise to support self-control.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Sleep and Memory Consolidation**: Adequate sleep optimizes hippocampal function (memory consolidation) and helps “reset” the prefrontal cortex for executive tasks the next day. Sleep deprivation markedly decreases impulse control and working memory capacity.
* **Glucose and Brain Function**: The brain requires a steady supply of glucose; a balanced diet (without excessive sugar spikes) supports sustained attention and emotional regulation. Rapid blood sugar fluctuations can impair frontal-lobe function, undercutting self‑control.
* **Exercise and Neurotrophic Factors**: Regular physical activity elevates levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which fosters neuron growth and enhances cognition. Exercise also improves blood flow, supporting better focus and stress resilience.

# II. Mental Framework Construction: Laying the Bricks

# 1. Goal Hierarchies (Mental “Blueprints”)

**Original Advice**: Align short-term tasks with mid- and long-term visions.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Working Memory and Goal Maintenance**: The prefrontal cortex holds short-term goals “online” and compares them to long-term objectives. Having a clear hierarchical structure reduces cognitive load—your brain knows how each action ties into a larger blueprint.
* **Motivational Systems**: When you perceive clear links between present tasks and future rewards, the striatum (a reward-related region) remains more active. This synergy keeps you motivated because the brain recognizes the present task as meaningful within a broader timeline.

# 2. Chunking and Layering Information

**Original Advice**: Break large tasks or information sets into smaller, more manageable pieces (mind mapping, categorizing).

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cognitive Load Theory**: The brain’s working memory is limited. Grouping information into “chunks” allows the brain to manage complexity more efficiently.
* **Schema Formation**: Over time, repeated exposure to well-structured knowledge leads to the creation of “schemas,” or mental frameworks stored in long-term memory. Once information is “chunked” into schemas, the brain can retrieve and manipulate these chunks with fewer cognitive resources.

# 1. Single-Pointed Concentration Practices

**Original Advice**: Traditional breath-focused meditation to train sustained attention.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**: Meditation, especially focus-based types, strengthens the ACC, improving the ability to detect when your mind has wandered.
* **Neuroplastic Changes**: Long-term meditators show structural changes in brain regions associated with attention and emotional regulation (e.g., increased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex).

# 2. Active Mind Control: Self‑Talk and NLP

**Original Advice**: Use positive reframing and precise language to guide your thoughts.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Linguistic Framing and the Brain**: How you phrase thoughts can shift neural responses in both emotional (limbic) and cognitive (frontal) areas. Positive reframing triggers a more problem-solving oriented network rather than a threat-focused network.
* **Neuro-Linguistic Pathways**: While the specifics of “NLP” remain debated, it’s clear that intentional self-talk can modulate the brain’s response to stress, primarily through the top-down regulation of the amygdala.

# 3. “Pre-Commitment” and Environment Control

**Original Advice**: Alter your environment to minimize temptations and pair tasks with positive triggers.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cue-Dependent Behaviors**: Environmental cues strongly affect automatic behaviors via the basal ganglia. Altering your environment reduces the presence of triggers for undesired habits while adding triggers for desired behaviors.
* **Prefrontal Cortex “Offloading”**: By engineering an environment that naturally aligns with your goals, you minimize the need for constant inhibitory control—frees up working memory and executive resources for more complex tasks.

# 1. Iteration and Self-Audit

**Original Advice**: Regularly review and adjust goals, habits, and progress.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Adaptive Coding**: The brain constantly adapts to new information and demands. Regular audits help you update neural “predictions” about which actions yield success or failure. This is akin to Bayesian updating in the brain—fresh data refines existing mental models.
* **Error Monitoring**: The ACC and related circuits use feedback about mistakes or successes to fine-tune behavior. Regular reflection creates more data points for these brain systems to adjust future actions.

# 2. Adapting to New Challenges

**Original Advice**: Scale your methods as tasks grow in complexity; adopt project management frameworks.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cognitive Flexibility**: Shifting from smaller tasks to more complex, multi-step challenges requires the lateral prefrontal cortex to handle additional layers of planning. Gradual up-leveling ensures the neural circuits for planning and inhibition expand in tandem with the demands.
* **Distributed Neural Networks**: Complex tasks draw upon multiple brain regions (frontal for planning, parietal for spatial/organizational tasks, temporal for memory). Introducing systematic frameworks helps orchestrate these networks without overwhelming any single system.

**Original Advice**: Keep acquiring new tools and knowledge for continuous growth.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Brain Plasticity Continues**: Contrary to old beliefs, neurogenesis and plasticity continue well into adulthood, especially in the hippocampus. Lifelong learning keeps these processes active, enhancing cognitive reserve.
* **Resilience and Mental Agility**: Continual learning and novelty-seeking promote dopamine release and maintain cognitive flexibility. This not only staves off mental rigidity but can protect against cognitive decline over time.

# Summary of the Neuroscientific Rationale

1. **Executive Control**: Many strategies rely on strengthening the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to regulate emotions, impulses, and attention.
2. **Reward and Reinforcement**: Incremental wins and conscious reward-seeking leverage dopaminergic pathways to build new habits and sustain motivation.
3. **Cognitive Load Management**: Techniques like chunking, mind mapping, and environment “hacking” reduce unnecessary strain on working memory, boosting overall efficiency.
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Labeling emotions, positive reframing, and meditation help down-regulate limbic (emotion-based) reactivity, promoting calm, focused action.
5. **Neuroplasticity**: Consistent practice of these behaviors rewires neural connections, solidifying the mental architecture for higher discipline, clarity, and adaptability.

By integrating these methods, you essentially **optimize brain function** in both the short and long term—enabling greater self-control, creativity, and resilience in the face of life’s challenges.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-24 15:21:41,BrandonLang

1geecym,lueumm8,I created a reasoning model that uses both OpenAI and Anthropic models.  When asked which company to subscribe to Claude 3.5 recommends OpenAI both in the reasoning and the final answer.,"This is interesting, but it seems like claude gets one step in the process versus two steps for gpt (4o and 4o mini, respectively).  If the roles were reversed, I'm not sure that the outcome would still pick ChatGPT -- but even then, it is unclear whether that is a function of model bias (i.e., claude being more charitable, less biased than gpt -- or not).",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-29 20:50:06,Careful_Meaning2022
