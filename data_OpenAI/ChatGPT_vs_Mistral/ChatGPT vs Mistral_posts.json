        "body": "This morning, Mistral dropped its \"Mistral Large\" model.\n\n[https://twitter.com/GuillaumeLample/status/1762128616849072171](https://twitter.com/GuillaumeLample/status/1762128616849072171)\n\nThey even included a new website to use it directly - [chat.mistral.ai](https://chat.mistral.ai).\n\nI didn't have much hopes, but I always like to try out new things. So I tested it with a query I had yesterday **that had stumped GPT-4.** It might be a bit technical, but I asked GPT-4:\n\n>What does factor investing theory have to say about small growth companies?\n\nThe correct answer is \"No\". In fact, Small-Cap growth companies have been shown to perform *negatively* over long time periods, and there's sufficient evidence to support this, and has been for some time.\n\nTo my surprise, ChatGPT-4 didn't have a specific answer, and even suggested that recent research into momentum factors indicated possible outperformance.\n\nHere is ChatGPT-4's response:\n\n[https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac](https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac)\n\nNow I didn't expect Mistral to do any better. How could it? GPT-4 is far and away the best thing I've found so far. To my shock, **it got it emphatically right!** Here's a screenshot:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y0g9nplyykc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5af9620698dfa4983e2e9fa18d7a4b9247471a\n\nFurthermore, when pressed on sources, Mistral Large correctly identified the academic papers that supported its thesis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Very VERY Cool!](https://preview.redd.it/c0gf5wsz0zkc1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f38cc34cb40839cca59df4069188004ce6d880e)\n\nMistral not only gave the right answer, it also gave the correct reasoning. It's also worth noting that **neither Gemini nor Claude 2 were able to give a clear, categorical answer as Mistral did.**\n\nNow this only dropped a few hours ago, so this is purely anecdotal evidence. But I'm impressed. VERY impressed!",

        "body": "After reading Mistral's announcement about their new Large model, which tests showed to be way better than GPT-3.5 but not as good as GPT-4, I went to compare the prices.\n\nMistral Large:\n\n* Input: $0.0027 per 1,000 tokens\n* Output: $0.024 per 1,000 tokens\n\nGPT-4 (0125):\n\n* Input: $0.01 per 1,000 tokens\n* Output: $0.03 per 1,000 tokens\n\nComparing the output tokens, Mistral Large is 20% cheaper, and to me, that doesn't seem worth the hassle of integrating or anything like that.  \nI'm already integrating the Mixtral 8x7B into my SnippetHub VS Code AI coding assistant, and that model holds its own against the GPT-3 model for way less money. But this price difference between GPT-4 and Mistral Large doesn't sit well with me. \n\nInitial tests show that Mistral Large is less lazy, but on the flip side, it has a bunch of downsides, like not having access to a Code Interpreter and stuff like that.  \n\n\nWhat's been your experience, have you tried out Le Chat and the new Mistral Large?",

I saw a user mention that they created an assistant using an older version of GPT-4 from the API and it resolved their issues. I'm tempted to do this too but before I go build my own interface for it I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how Copilot currently stacks up? I use it in my VSCode but more as a good auto complete for simple stuff vs the full chat experience\n\nAny input is appreciated!\n\nBonus: has anyone moved entirely to a different model for their code generation? Last I tried Claude 2 and Bard-Gemini-Pro seemed to still fall short of GPT-4, even with the regression.",

        "body": "I\u2019ve been diving into different AI APIs recently and came across DeepSeek AI agents, which seem to be an interesting alternative to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is widely used and well-documented, DeepSeek introduces some unique claims that got me curious\u2014especially around API performance, customization, and use cases.\n\nHere are some aspects of DeepSeek I found worth exploring:\n\n1. Performance Claims: Documentation mentions sub-500ms response times, even for complex tasks. Anyone validated this in real-world use?\n\n\n2. Pricing: The token-based pricing model seems 20\u201330% cheaper than GPT-4\u2019s API, which could matter for high-volume users.\n\n\n3. Context Handling: Offers extended or unlimited context windows when self-hosting. I\u2019m wondering how practical this is for heavy workflows.\n\n\n4. Pre-Built Agents: Includes tools designed for coding, data analysis, and research. Has anyone tested how effective these are out of the box?\n\n\n5. Stateful Workflows: Features memory management for multi-step interactions. This could be helpful for developers building conversational apps or automations.\n\n\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve been comparing these to OpenAI\u2019s APIs, which excel in areas like:\n\nA large ecosystem (e.g., plugins, third-party integrations)\n\nRobustness for creative tasks like storytelling\n\nWell-defined safety guardrails for sensitive applications\n\n\nThat said, here are some questions for discussion:\n\n1. Have you tested DeepSeek in production environments? How does it handle scale and reliability?\n\n\n2. How does its code generation compare to ChatGPT\u2019s tools like the Code Interpreter?\n\n\n3. Is the pricing difference meaningful for your projects?\n\n\n4. Are there any trade-offs, like regional access, support quality, or rate limits?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll share some of my own observations in the comments, but I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s worked with these APIs. Are these new players like DeepSeek serious contenders in the LLM space, or are they still catching up to the incumbents?\n",

        "body": "Let's establish some basics. \n\n[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  \n[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math\n\nHow are they different from 4o?  \nIf I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.\n\n4o  \nWhen you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.\n\nWhy o1?  \nAfter GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  \n\nOpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  \n\nWhat did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  \n\nExample:  \noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\n\nUse the example above to decode.\n\noyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\n\n[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). \n\nNone of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  \n\nMy personal experience:\nIm currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  \n\nManually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  \nI wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  \n\nI gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  \n\nA step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  \n1. Reiterating the problem \n2. Solution \n3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate \n4. Explanation \n5. Security \n6. Deployment instructions. \n\nAll of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  \n\nI integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  \n\nRan the code. No errors, interesting.  \n\nDid it do what I needed it to do?   \n\nF*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   \n\nAfter finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.\n\nI feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  \n\nSome notes:  \n* Always use o1-mini for coding. \n* Always use the API version if possible. \n\nFinal word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.\n\nEdit 1:\nWhy use the API vs ChatGPT?\nChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.\nWith API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  \n\nNote: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",

The chef is wearing a spotless white double-breasted chef's jacket with her name embroidered in blue on the breast pocket. Black and white checkered pants and slip-resistant clogs complete her professional attire. A colorful array of sauce stains on her apron tells the story of a busy service. Behind her, the kitchen is a hive of activity. Stainless steel surfaces gleam under bright overhead lights, reflecting the controlled chaos of dinner service. Sous chefs in white jackets move purposefully between stations, and steam rises from pots on industrial stoves. Plates of artfully arranged dishes wait on the pass, ready for service. In the foreground, a marble countertop is visible, strewn with fresh herbs and exotic spices. A stack of well-worn cookbooks sits nearby, hinting at the chef's dedication to her craft and continuous learning.

        "body": "I recently wrote an article comparing Grok 2 and ChatGPT, and I thought I\u2019d share some of the key points here. Both are good tools, but they\u2019re designed for slightly different purposes. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what I found:\n\n1. **Real-Time Updates**: Grok 2 is plugged into X (formerly Twitter), so it can pull live, real-time data. It\u2019s great if you want up-to-the-minute info on trending topics. ChatGPT has a browsing feature (if you\u2019re on the Plus plan), but it\u2019s not as tightly tied to social media platforms.\n2. **Image Generation**: Grok 2 uses something called the FLUX model for unfiltered image creation, which gives you more creative freedom. ChatGPT\u2019s DALL-E tool is more restricted\u2014it has guardrails in place to avoid misuse, which is great if you\u2019re worried about ethical concerns.\n3. **Tone and Interaction**: Grok 2 has a \u201cfun mode\u201d for more casual chats, which can be entertaining if that\u2019s your thing. ChatGPT keeps things professional across the board, which makes it feel more consistent if you\u2019re using it for work or serious tasks.\n4. **Accessibility**: ChatGPT is super easy to access\u2014it works as a standalone app on web, iOS, and Android. Grok 2 is tied to X and mostly available to Premium users right now, so it\u2019s a bit more limited in terms of where you can use it.\n5. **Ethics and Safeguards**: This is where ChatGPT stands out\u2014it has stricter guidelines to prevent misuse, especially with image generation or sensitive topics. Grok 2 takes a more unfiltered approach, which can be cool for creativity but also raises some questions around misinformation or inappropriate content.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into the details, here\u2019s the full article:\u00a0[https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/grok-2-vs-chatgpt/](https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/grok-2-vs-chatgpt/)\n\nHave any of you tried either of these?

I mean, what the hell! I'm sure it would have been been a nice cherry on the cake for OpenAI to have Johannson's voice, but it's such a small part of the concept, that it stinks of someone's ego getting so big to think that they're the star of a breakthrough technology.\n\nJohannson's actions have directly led to the loss of a big chunk of someone's livelihood - a deal that would have set up the Sky voice actress for life.

I feel a bit sad to say that it has lost is charm to a certain extent. It's not as powerful as I feel Claude is right now. I was not quickly impressed by the claims people were making about Claude but then I went ahead created an account and gave it a couple of problems ChatGPT was struggling with and it handled it with expertise which I instantly felt. Kept using it for a while and for the problems ChatGPT 4o was behaving like 3.5, it gave me solutions which were grounded and clear. Debugging is much more robust with Sonnet.\n\nI hope ChatGPT gets its grip back as it has got more incentives for pro users but since last two days Claude helped me save a couple of hours. I have begun thinking about migration, atleast for a time being. Or keep pro for both tools.\n\nWanted to put it out there.\n\nEdit: I just subscribed to Claude Pro. Keeping both subscriptions for now. I have a couple of ongoing projects and I believe I have a use case for both. With the limits removed, I have worked on Claude more than ChatGPT, it's not been too long though, around an hour.\n\nI may edit this post again in near future with my findings and for others to decide.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: January 23rd, 2025.\n\nIt's been seven months since I first posted, which seems to rank high for Claude vs ChatGPT searches. I wanted to update on my journey as promised.\n\nAfter switching from ChatGPT to Claude, I never looked back. My entire coding workflow shifted to Claude, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I started with Claude Chat directly, but when Cursor emerged, I tried it and found it to be the most efficient way to code using Sonnet. These days, I no longer maintain a Claude subscription and exclusively use Cursor.\n\nI only resubscribed to ChatGPT last month for real-time voice chat (language learning). I still use it for basic tasks like grammar checks and searches - essentially as a replacement for Google and as a general AI assistant - but never for coding anymore.\n\nFor those finding this through Google: it's now well-established in the dev community that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most capable and intelligent coding LLM. Cursor's initial popularity was tied to Claude, but it has evolved into a powerful IDE with features like agent composer and much more.\n\nFor non-coders: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is, in my opinion, a far more intelligent and precise tool than GPT-4o and even o1. While I can't list all examples here, for every single non-coding task I've given it, I've received more refined, crafted, and precise responses.\n\nThis shift was a game-changer for my productivity and business gains. To tech founders and small teams building products: unless ChatGPT specifically fits your coding needs, consider switching to Cursor. It has literally transformed my business and boosted profits significantly. Grateful to the Claude team for their work.",

        "body": "If you make coding requests directly in ChatGPT 4 with a prompt and copy paste your code in triple backticks, it's consistently helpful and complete, giving you your entire project back to you with modifications with minimal prompting.  But the moment you attach a file, it becomes noticibly, consistently lazy and refuses to complete full scripts. Is this known?\n\nWhen I need GPT to gather additional info online, I take whatever I've been working on in this copy/paste mode and attach it as a file in a new session, invoking the interpreter that can go online.  It can research online properly, but always spits back a half-assed \"Rest of your code goes here\" template, no matter how hard I push it. I then paste the half-assed snippet back into the original non-interpreter copy/paste session and ask it to make changes based on it, which it happily incorporates into a final, fully combined script, using the new information.\n\nWasn't GPT supposed to have been made less 'lazy' recently? What would be the source of the stark differences when you attach files? Is the interpreter still using the old 'unfixed' model, and do other folks notice this workaround?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "Hello, \n\nI have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:\n\nI've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   \n\nBut now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  \n\nIs that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  \n\nSuppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? \n\nLastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? \n\nI apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   \n\n- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive \"Wikis\" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)\n\n- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     \n\n**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**\n\nAnyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    \n\nReally struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!   \n\nThanks!\nCheers\n ",

However, Copilot is available for free, while ChatGPT 4 requires a subscription fee of $20.  I primarily intend to use these tools for coding assistance, generating code snippets, and understanding diagrams. \n\nWhile I've noticed some relevant plugins (Show me Diagram and Code) in ChatGPT 4, I'm not sure if they offer any significant advantage over Copilot. \n\nHave any of you used both Copilot and ChatGPT 4 for coding and diagram generation? Which one would you recommend, considering factors like ease of use, accuracy, and available features? Is it worth spending the $20 for ChatGPT 4, or does Copilot provide comparable functionality for free?

        "body": "I have been using ChatGPT for my studying lately and I have encountered quite a few flaws of the algorithm.\n\nFirst of all both version have a rule where they try to output about a page, if the question is very simple they might output less but usually it is between 3/4 to 5/4 of a page. Now if you were to ask it complex question or ask about a complex topic or multiple topic, the output is going to suffer thanks to this limitation. What it means is it will try to fit in the information in this page format, either omitting important details or mumbling things together, with meaningless general statements (4 always starts its sentences how crucial and important said topic is for something, which has no informational value and it has so far said this about everything I asked it about)\n\nSecondly there is actually quite a difference in the way 3.5 and 4 formats text, where 3.5 generally outputs plain text with maybe few bullet points, something that looks like it came copied straight from wikipedia, 4 likes to create all kinds of special formatting with chapters, sub chapters and sub sub chapters, together with \"interesting way\" how it sums up information. From my experience 4 loves to create really broad a general descriptions that could fit anything to an extreme\n\nNow what this means thanks to the page limit is that if you ask 4 about something like \"general topic( 1 topic, 2 topic, 3 topic)\" it will generate perfectly formatted structure that contains so little information (usually something like Topic: Topic1 : The idea: This is very important idea in general that is crucial to broadly understand topic 1 in the context of topic), that the whole idea of asking 4 about this is completely pointless, 3.5 on the other hand might produce at least 3 little paragraphs of text, that provide some information.\n\nThese outcomes make me wonder if chatGPT 4 isnt thanks to its formatting a little overfitted for coding\n\nAlso I often read here how people who use chatGPT a lot are usually stuck with 4, I suggest try using 3.5 sometimes, especially if you want continuous text, it might out perform 4. Compared to 4, 3.5 gets straight to the point, it is simpler so if you are asking for summary of important information it will generate articles similar to those you might find on wikipedia, while 4 will spend way too much space on sugercoating the information with how important it is both before and after the information part which degrades the information part thanks to said algorithm that keeps the generated text around the length of a page.",

Bing Image Creator is powered by DALL-E 3 and can create a limited number of images for free (until you run out of tokens).  \n2. Bing is--by default--a browser with Internet access and is powered by GPT-4 (at least in \"Creative\" mode).  \n3. Bing has had image recognition enabled for several months now.  \n\n\nThis begs the question: Are ChatGPT Plus versions of the above worth the $20 monthly subscription fee for those who have been on the fence until now?  \n\n\nThat's exactly what I try to answer in my latest hands-on review.

        "body": "I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take \n\nThe past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs \n\nVerdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model \n\nI am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. \n\nThe project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. \n\n\u2705 o1-mini pros \n- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done\n- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot\n- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. \n- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this \n\n\u274eo1-mini cons\n- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. \n- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues\n- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a \"conversational\" LLM due to long thinking time \n- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. \n- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly \n- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either\n- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. \n\n\u2728 o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions \n- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot \n- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the \ud83d\udc51 of closed source coding LLM\n- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet \n",

        "body": "This is a genuine opinion and review, not a shitpost. This is an unbiased viewpoint.\n\nI\u2019ll put it into rounds.\n\nResponse speed: YouChat\nYouChat usually responds to requests quicker which is probably a result of less traffic and popularity. It will probably slow down when popularity grows.\n\nUsefulness: ChatGPT\nBoth are similarly useful and are seemingly designed for different tasks. While YouChat can cite sources, ChatGPT gives more detail which is going to give it a win this round. Both have an equal censorship level for creating insults and so on.\n\nResponses: ChatGPT\nUsually, YouChat will answer questions and make guesses if it isn\u2019t completely aware. If ChatGPT is even slightly unsure it will refuse to answer. The issue with YouChat here is that it can\u2019t actually respond to you well or go into detail about things, it keeps it\u2019s answers short and you need to ask more, but when you do, it forgets what it just said.\n\nMemory: ChatGPT\nYouChat has very short term memory and will not remember things you said earlier or create context, ChatGPT will remember 3000 words, winning it this round.\n\nAccuracy: draw\nBoth know a lot, however ChatGPT relies on datasets meaning it doesn\u2019t have up to date information whereas YouChat is owned by a search engine, making all the responses cited and accurate to present day. YouChat does however give incorrect information more often.\n\nOverview:\nClearly both have their own use cases and while YouChat is a rising competitor it simply cannot do as well as ChatGPT generally. If you\u2019re looking for a quick answer to a term not generally known YouChat works. If you want to make code, a story or just chat and have an intelligent robot, YouChat just won\u2019t work.",

I understand that there is some inherent stochasticity at play here that can cause individual results to differ.\n\nWhat I'm looking for here is best practice recommendations that I can follow to close the discrepancy between the two models as much as possible. For example, one thing I would like to do is make sure the underlying tunable parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) are the same. Is it known what values of those parameters chatgpt uses?

        "body": "*I decided to compare the math skills of* ***ChatGPT*** *and* ***Bard***\\*. For the test, I used the most difficult\\* ***GMAT*** *(Graduate Management Admission Test) problems that cover various topics. Here are the results I obtained:*\n\n* As you know, they can almost always solve **simple problems** easily.\n* Both models have no trouble with **geometry problems** that require 2-3 steps.\n* They can solve **complex problems** involving taxes, deductions, and discounts without any difficulty. They also handle **set problems**, including those presented in Venn diagrams, quite easily.\n* Problems involving **conditional probabilities** (such as Bayes' theorem) and **multiplication of probabilities** also pose no difficulties. However, they often struggle with problems related to **discrete probability**, and their solutions are frequently incorrect.\n* They solve **logical problems** fine. Both language models usually approach problem-solving correctly, but they often arrive at incorrect answers due to inaccurate calculations (notably, the errors resemble human mistakes).\n* Surprisingly, both language models understand **pie charts** by measuring the data pixel-wise, which generally provides an answer that is extremely close to the correct one.\n* It's also noteworthy that language models face difficulties when solving problems that involve creating **systems of linear equations** (ironically, considering they themselves are systems of linear equations).\n* Both models can handle **graph-related problems** (finding asymptotes, intersection points, determining the graph of a function). Bing can even attempt to plot them, even if the data is digital:  \n\n   * It writes the correct Python code.\n   * It imports pandas and matplotlib(!). However, it cannot compile the code.\n\nDespite these similarities, the chosen language models have **differences**: based on my observations, the new version of Bard and ChatGPT (Bing) perform almost equally well in problem-solving, but Bing provides detailed solutions, which is much better for understanding the problem-solving process, while Bard describes the general formula and immediately provides the answer, which is undoubtedly less informative.It's also worth mentioning that Bard is clearly already using PaLM2, at least in my case, as it has become smarter and much faster, especially compared to ChatGPT.\n\n*An amusing and slightly frustrating fact: Bard often gives up quickly, although it can still solve a problem (or attempt to do so) if it is rephrased, even if it does the rephrasing itself!*\n\nIn conclusion, although language models may not be able to solve all problems (which is probably a good thing), they help find the right approach to problem-solving, which is impressive, I must say.\n\n*I made a video on this topic and would appreciate your comments, additions, discussions, and corrections:*\n\n[*https://youtu.be/kl5P6bteqFI*](https://youtu.be/kl5P6bteqFI)",

It explains things really well and almost as though it was a person having a conversation. \n\nIt makes mistakes sometimes, especially if given the same equation multiple times (I did that as a test to see what would happen). I'm told this is because it's programmed to respond differently/randomly to the same inputs or something, I dunno. \n\nI was using Google earlier to search for how to do something maths related. I was searching for an explanation for about 20 minutes until I remembered I had chatGPT to ask also. So I asked it, and it gave the answer immediately. \n\nAt the very least, it can be used to get the answer you're looking for, and if you still don't fully understand and it can't explain it well enough, you now have a \"copy and paste\" base to work off if you feel the need to go into Google and search further. \n\nSo, is Google's new A.i. they're bringing out expected to be anywhere near as good as this? \n\nPresumably, if ChatGPT (in it's Bing integrated version) is really honed in and becomes extremely reliable, then what will be the point of Google if it's A.i. can't keep up? \n\nWith the way Alphabet so aggressively protects it's dominance in it's field (I've never seen a single company acquire so many smaller companies that are potential threats to it), it's hard to imagine they won't come out with something amazing that can compete with ChatGPT right?",

The tasks o1-preview failed to solve, and I also compared it with the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nFor full analysis, check out this blog post: [OpenAI o1 vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://composio.dev/blog/openai-o1-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet/)\n\nHere are some key insights:\n\n* o1 full is a genuine step up from the o1-preview on maths and reasoning. It solved the questions that the o1-preview failed to do.\n* Contrary to the benchmark result shared in the system card, in my limited uses, o1 felt better than the Preview in coding.\n* Creative writing has significantly improved.\n* 50 messages/week is an absolute deal breaker, but I use it with 4o in tandem for optimal usage.\n\n# How does it compare to Claude?\n\n* o1 wins in math and reasoning; it\u2019s not even close.\n* Claude is still king for coding.\n* Claude has more personality and feels close to talking to a real person.\n* o1 feels like a high-IQ yes-guy intern. I would have liked it better if it was a bit less agreeable.\n\n# Which one to pick?\n\n* If you need models exclusively for coding, Claude offers better value.\n* For math, reasoning, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive, consider ChatGPT, but keep an eye on the per-week quota.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on it and which one you liked more from your experience.",

I think it should be 5-10 a month. Maybe even bundled like spotify (a subscription with a 5$ option btw). I feel that this company is obviously hemorrhaging money and there is an untapped market (students) who would totally get this bundled with github pro or even spotify. I know some will disagree with me here and say that it isnt expensive or that its worth it, but thinking from a logical perspective. Chatgpt had a real chance to integrate itself into the daily life for the average internet user that doesnt code and capture them with a reasonable subscription as if they were paying for spotify. The average user will not pay 20$ as they would compare that subscription to others of similar prices like netflix, WoW, gym memberships\u2026all subscriptions that take hours of a person\u2019s time in a month vs chatgpt where the average retention would be significantly less. \n\nedit: turns out I was right about them hemmoraging money",

I've had 5+ issues where Claude (or 4o, or Gemini) couldn't figure it out, but o1 nailed it. o1 even helped me figure out the proper VS Code config and vite.config.js settings to set breakpoints in JSX code, where Claude, ChatGpt 4o, and VS Code Copilot (shame! shame!) all failed.  Last night when Claude hit me with a message limit reached, imposing a 90 minute cooldown (which only happened because I was furiously resubmitting tweaked prompts in hopes that Claude would fix a pesky bug that it itself had introduced somewhere deep in the bowels of the UI code) \u2014 fortunately o1 came to the rescue.\n\nBUT, I'm often creating a prompt with almost 4K lines to give o1 the context because it won't allow attaching code files or be used in a Projects.

ChatGPT forced all other competitors to show their cards.  OpenAI still leads this whole revolution.  As soon as they lose the top spot on LLMSYS they update the model to go back to #1.

(ask it to help you diagnose a cooling system of a specific vehicle and the information you get back is of generic vehicle cooling systems with unrelated parts and suggestions. seems limited to simpler things like checking the weather forecast)\n3. Dalle-3 mode is admittedly pretty cool but it loves to censor the most mundane things frustratingly. (i tried generic product prototype sketches for a medical kit and it refused to produce some images based on the kits contents.)\n4. voice mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but wont work with browsing so is very limited compared to something like alexa or siri. unlike those services you cant exactly ask it to look something up for you or do something for you.\n5. its ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is severely lacking compared to claude 2. claude has the ability to read data related images and graphs from PDF documents at a glance. GPT-4 falters in this area even though it has image recognition capabilities from directly uploaded images and is decent with making guesses on makes and models of vehicles.\n\nan example of how obtuse GPT-4 can be compared to claude:\n\n[https://chat.openai.com/share/b7d2e3b9-20ac-4b86-b125-cdccf11deb54](https://chat.openai.com/share/b7d2e3b9-20ac-4b86-b125-cdccf11deb54)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1lqvpetq6xb1.png?width=2604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4c98cb63c44fbcbabcddfd7ff7a326f2eb15852",

Like moving storyboards.\n> \n> When it comes to production, it's not out of the realm of possibility that as this tech gets better, studios will be able to generate ideas without having to pay teams of animators to create them.\n> \n> The ease of creating diverse visual content could lead to the emergence of new genres and formats that blend live-action, animation, and AI-generated content in novel ways, pushing the boundaries of current storytelling paradigms.\n> \n> But it could also decrease professionalism. If anyone can just do this stuff, do we all become \"content creators\" instead of filmmakers and storyteller?\n> \n> Will the industry I love behind to shrink uncontrollably due to anyone being able to prompt their ideas to life?\n> \n> Can you have a great idea or screenplay that cuts through the noise if everyone is generating slop?\n> \n> **Will Movies and TV Become Like TikTok?**\n> \n> Of course, as this tech improves, people can animate their own stories. And right now, most people consume stories via their phones, watching short snippets.\n> \n> I have a real worry that Generation Z has trained themselves on short-form content in such a way that it will slowly begin to replace longer things like movies and TV shows.\n> \n> That might be overkill, but it crosses my mind when I see how Reels and TikTok have incorporated product placement. And how man amateur content creators have dominated that medium.\n> \n> What happens when they can make their own animated stories to release on those platforms? We already get the AI voiceover videos and images. This is just the next logical step.\n> \n> **Do We Have Any Legal Protections?**\n> \n> The secondary worry is that as the photo-realism gets better and better, they'll be able to license people's likeness or generate content starring people without their consent.\n> \n> There was already a huge news story involving fake pornogrpahic images of Taylor Swift generated by AI. Where does the line get drawn?\n> \n> And what kinds of protections can we assume?\n> \n> Right now, we have nothing in place. There will have to be congressional hearings and we will have to look into the ethics of all this.\n> \n> The reason is that AI cannot generate ideas from thin air. It scours the internet and takes images generated by human beings as well as aert, photos, drawings, and any other visuals. Then it amalgamates all of that and adapts from it.\n> \n> We're still trying to define if this is plagiarism or stealing.\n> \n> All of this needs to happen soon, before these programs are readily used by the public.\n> \n> The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas for rules that make AI impressions of real people illegal.\n> \n> The FTC wrote in a news release. \u201cThe agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes \u2014 threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.\u201d\n> \n> In summary, this technology could revolutionize how content is produced, making it more accessible and efficient while also raising essential discussions around creativity, copyright, and the ethical use of AI in media.\n> \n> For now, this stuff is moving fast and we don't totally have a grip on what it means, but these are my thoughts.\n\nhttps://nofilmschool.com/sora-text-to-image-hollywood\n\n> **OpenAI's Latest Tool Provokes A Lot Of Questions About Hollywood's Direction**\n>\n> Topline:\n> \n> > What does Open AI\u2019s Sora mean for the future of Hollywood? Depends on who you ask. \n> \n> **The background**: OpenAI\u2019s latest tool, Sora, can make realistic-looking footage with simple text-to-video commands. The quality appears good enough to populate shows and films \u2014 and is stunningly cinematic.\n> \n> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you\u2019re able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.\n> \n> **Should Hollywood be worried?** If you believe AI will disrupt Hollywood for the worse, Entertainment Strategy Guy says, that \u201cthe best way to mitigate the harms is to make the people and companies responsible for AIs development responsible for its deployment.\"\n> \n> \"That means if OpenAI releases Sora into the world, and customers use it for fraudulent, deceptive or illegal purposes, then the government can hold OpenAI liable,\" he added.\n\nhttps://laist.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/openai\n\n> **Tyler Perry Puts $800M Studio Expansion on Hold After Seeing OpenAI\u2019s Sora: \u201cJobs Are Going to Be Lost\u201d**\n> \n> The actor, filmmaker and studio owner is raising the alarm about the impact of the tech, saying, \"I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails.\"\n> \n> Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold \u2014 thanks to the rapid developments he\u2019s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI\u2019s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.\n> \n> \u201cBeing told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,\u201d he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.\n> \n> As a business owner, Perry sees the opportunity in these developments, but as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise in the alarm. In an interview between shoots on Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the technology\u2019s impact on labor and why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don\u2019t see how we survive.\u201d\n> \n> **After seeing Sora, what are your current feelings about how fast AI technology is moving and how it might affect entertainment in the near term?**\n> \n> I have been watching AI very closely and watching the advancements very closely. I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would\u2019ve increased the backlot a tremendous size, we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I\u2019m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it\u2019s able to do. It\u2019s shocking to me.\n> \n> **What in particular was shocking to you about its capabilities?**\n> \n> I no longer would have to travel to locations. If I wanted to be in the snow in Colorado, it\u2019s text. If I wanted to write a scene on the moon, it\u2019s text, and this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains, I don\u2019t have to build a set in the mountains, I don\u2019t have to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.\n> \n> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I\u2019m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.\n> \n> **Are you currently implementing AI in any of your productions and/or do you plan to do so in the near future?**\n> \n> I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup.\n> \n> **How are you thinking about approaching the threat that AI poses to certain job categories at your studio and on your productions?**\n> \n> Everything right now is so up in the air. It\u2019s so malleable. The technology\u2019s moving so quickly. I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other studio in town, we\u2019re all trying to figure it all out. I think we\u2019re all trying to find the answers as we go, and it\u2019s changing every day \u2014 and it\u2019s not just our industry, but it\u2019s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it\u2019s changing so quickly, I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to sustain, is my hope.\n> \n> **How would you like the entertainment industry as a whole to confront this rapidly developing technology?**\n> \n> I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach. It can\u2019t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes. I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I\u2019m not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.\n> \n> **What\u2019s your message for the industry at this point, as we\u2019re watching this unfold?**\n> \n> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.\n> \n> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**\n> \n> No. I\u2019m absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I\u2019m definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we\u2019re protecting all the people that are coming up. So I\u2019ve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I\u2019m looking at my business and the bottom line, but I\u2019m also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I\u2019m concerned about what will happen to them.\n> \n> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**\n> \n> I think it\u2019s going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would\u2019ve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you\u2019re looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.\n> \n> **Who needs to act? You\u2019re speaking up about this, but who else should be speaking up and working on this?**\n> \n> I just hope that as people are embracing this technology and as companies are moving to reduce costs and save the bottom line, that there\u2019ll be some sort of thought and some sort of compassion for humanity and the people that have worked in this industry and built careers and lives, that there\u2019s some sort of thought for them. And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/tyler-perry-ai-alarm-1235833276/\n\n> In 5-10 years we\u2019ll be talking about capabilities not even being envisioned now, so most of the answers to this question are off the mark. Today\u2019s tech will have a marginal disruption, but 10-15 product evolutions of AI will be completely different.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kri6wq9/\n\n> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.\n> \n> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kribfuj/\n\n> The inevitable result is prompting an AI to generate a custom movie or tv episode on demand. That\u2019s months away.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krin9w3/\n\n> Sora is as low quality as AI generated videos will ever be in future. It I\u2019ll get better and better wih more options and ease of use,. AI will certainly dominate in 15 years. The amount\n> \n> Creativity will mushroom. We\u2019ve seen this in ditital photography. Friends of mine now have photos of birds, insects, our hiking trips, etc that rival anything from the top quality magazines of 20 years ago.\n> \n> In addition are resources. Thr investment in AI dwarfs that of Hollywood multiple times over. And, it\u2019s also dwarfs thr American entertainment industry outside of thr USA in China, Japan, etc.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krh5zd8/\n\n> > Doesn't matter if anyone can \"produce\" a \"Hollywood tier\" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.\n> \n> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in \"the brand\".\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krhaeoo/\n\n> In 5 years time it will be something like: -Computer I want to see Predator vs Rambo /Generating script /Generating scenes /Rendering, movie will start playing in 60 minutes\n> \n> In 10 years it starts playing immediately and you'll be able to play in it too with VR set (or direct to brain) and adapt in real time.

OpenAI claim that a surprisingly good level of consistency can be achieved just by scaling up the compute. Now combine that with other algorithmic improvements and imagine where we are in another year. Consider also that OpenAI think this might be a way to achieve AGI as well. SORA certainly will not be able to replace movies, but the model that comes after might be able to, and either way, it'll probably be sooner than we think.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kripwi7/\n\n> Within the right framework, i.e. an interface that allows saving certain environments / characters and changing specific areas or parameters based on text AND image input: The way movies are made is most definitely going to be affected by this tech.

All of the sudden for the cost of a green screen and a software subscription you could make a Nolan level shot of a jet crashing into a building. On the other hand if it's too cheap it may make traditional film making not financially feasible. At the end of the day movie making is a business and if the option is to spend $100M making it, or $10M making 10 things where 1 in 10 make similar money, then they may just do that instead. It may also kill career progression pathways so it's hard to get the next Nolan because no one gets to shoot b-role or commercials to build their resume.\n> \n> I think it will be interesting to see how this plays out in the next 10 years.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krkv8bj/\n\n> They are going to put a stake in the heart of the movie industry.

At present, all it can do is let someone move a mousepointer with their mind. The gap between \"mouse pointer\" and \"Ai prompt\" is very small though.

Anyone can be a writer\\director now. Hollywood's mote is gone. I'm pretty excited to see what millions of amateur film makers will do with this technology. Sure, plenty of it will be crap but there will be some unique gems, created with unique (non-Hollywood) perspectives, created this year. Exciting times.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krmq226/\n\n> You got a crystal ball? Because most people four years ago would have said about the LLMs we got now that they were impossible. Zero percent chance of ASI in 25 years seems pretty bold given the capabilities of our three year old LLM's.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjr7af/\n\n> But who would have predicted 10 years ago how big TikTok, youtube, etc., would become, never mind the huge and frankly horrifying market of video made just for old folks glued to Facebook-like-feeds all day? The sizes of the short form and long form video industries are on a trajectory to intersect at some point. It does not strike me as certain that a show or film is, in the long term, the content form our minds can be most made to seek out by industry.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjsorg/\n\n> I agree regards technologies that do not create their own positive feedback loops. I disagree that all technology falls into this category.\n> \n> The moment an AI can build the next best AI faster than a human, all bets are off. I am not making any claims about how close to that moment we are, but I find the claim that it is certainly more than 25 years in the future hard to defend.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjxz6t/\n\n> There is some truth to this, but nobody really knows where we are on the sigmoid of progress on gen AI.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjxwn2/\n\n> Even weirder than this...\n> \n> I think reality television will be the only media humans will continue to produce. Watching REAL humans competing and/or suffering or just reacting to various things will go on... but AI will be our source for fiction and storytelling.\n> \n> (We'll have artists, writers and directors curating our AI generated content for a fair chunk of time first though, so Pixar isn't done just yet)\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1axj891/continuation_thread_will_animation_studios_like/krqhoec/?context=3\n\n> Wrong. I absolutely want to pump in my own specifications and watch an ai movie. It would be awesome.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krqg09v/\n\n> That\u2019s because no one\u2019s seen it yet lol. Once they do, it\u2019s gonna change things big time. My understanding is the question was not time sensitive.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krr6lyb/\n\n> I\u2019m assuming the system is gonna be we all have access to these movie generator tools, and we all make custom content for ourselves? Will anyone want to watch MY movie? Prolly not. Will people want their own custom movies? Ya. Prolly.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krqo9se/\n\n> At some point (not necessarily soon) you'll probably be able to have full movies generated per your description. Will probably take out a good chunk of Hollywood business.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krquayk/\n\n> Why would anyone care if the general populous wants to want the movie I generated for myself??\n> \n> If I am generating a movie based on my own interests, and everyone else has that capability, why would they go and spend money to watch someone else's movie at the theaters?\n> \n> Giving everyone access to something lowers the barrier to entry. Not everyone had computers back in the day, but now everyone does. There won't be a need for Hollywood to generate movies for you if you can generate them yourself exactly how you want them.\n> \n> Now, don't get me wrong, I don't believe we will reach this point for a very, very long time, given how computationally expensive it is at the moment\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krrrw24/\n\n> You act as though Hollywood is littered with peak cinema\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krsjglb/\n\nGiven these, do you expect Hollywood to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora is officially released this year? Why or why not?\n\nP.S. I advise you all to read everything carefully including those comments from r/Futurology before posting any comments.",

Or are they intentionally misunderstanding what is written to be able to say that \"OpenAI is gatekeeping the best model behind $200 paywall?\n\n\nP.S. To be fair there is also the difference of 32k vs 128k context window. But it's still the same model. \n\nEdit: I stand corrected on the \"generating multiple outputs\" thing.

Over last few months, just been trying to familiar myself with A.I. in general and mainly some practical use case scenarios I may be able to take advantage of it.  With that being said, I have a few questions\n\n-For my Apple IPhone users, I have learned there is a paid subscription service for ChatGPT. Is this necessary to take full advantage of this application? What are some of the differences in the paid vs free version? Doesn\u2019t have to be only Apple (iPhone) related, because I am sure ChatGPT will be on other devices.\n\n-What are some general real life scenarios, someone like me who loves tech but just doesn\u2019t have a huge understanding of the power of ChatGPT, will be able to use the application (iPhone or other devices) to help me our? I know it\u2019s used for images and for writing papers or articles, but is there any other not so popular advantages it offers? Either recreational or professional?\n\n-Going off the last question, what are some ways someone can use ChatGPT for basically entertainment. Maybe that\u2019s not the right verbiage, but basically are there any interesting rabbit hole type concepts that really harness the power of ChatGPT that can make for a good time sink? Try to think of someone who doesn\u2019t know much about A.I. and without spending a ton of time learning the ins and outs; is there anything an average person can do to maybe make ChatGPT be a little more interesting. Just trying to think of ways to use it and see if it\u2019s an application I can see myself using.\n\nAnything else you guys would like to share would be amazing. Honestly, just trying to facilitate some conversation, especially for people who are like me whose knowledge of A.I. is basically what we see on TV or popular webpages. Sorry for the open ended questions and I hope this post is allowed to stay up. I wouldn\u2019t mind meeting people who have a better understanding of it and can share your knowledge.

        "body": "Hello! I'm a Biology major currently using the free versions of ChatGPT (occasionally getting access to GPT-4o before it reverts to another model) and Claude (3.5 Sonnet is currently the free version). I don't use these for coding - I mainly feed them large PowerPoint presentations + large 20 page textbook chapters from my courses to create simplified summaries while retaining key information. This helps me prepare outlines before lectures, so I can focus on adding new information from the professor during class.\n\nI'm facing two main issues:\n\n1. Limited input size: I can't input large texts like a 20,000-word book chapter all at once. Breaking content into smaller chunks works as a solution, so its not a huge deal.\n2. Restricted output length: The summaries seem too condensed. For instance, when I input two 5-page sections and ask for a combined summary, I get about 3 pages back. It should be more like 5-9 pages. In contrast, when I use MistralAI, it generates much longer outputs without limitation.\n\nThese limitations have me considering a paid subscription to either ChatGPT (so I can get o1) or Claude. I'm wondering if services like ChatGPT Plus with GPT o1 would allow for larger outputs.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n* I need something sophisticated enough for college-level biology. While benchmarks show Claude excels at coding, that's not relevant to my use case.\n* I'd prefer the ability to input audio (like lecture recordings) and get summaries in 10-minute increments. I believe only GPT o1  offer this feature, though I currently work around this by using Whisper to convert audio to text before feeding it to GPT/Claude.\n\nI'm also curious about alternative options. Platforms like Poe.com and You.com offer multiple LLMs (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4 Turbo + Llama, etc.) for roughly the same price as a single ChatGPT or Claude subscription. However, I've noticed their API implementations might not match the quality of the original services. Would subscribing directly through OpenAI or Anthropic provide better token limits and output sizes?",

        "body": "Current discussions about AGI often get bogged down in abstract definitions and theoretical debates, rather than focusing on practical, real-world applications. As a thought experiment and with the help of Claude and ChatGPT, I've created a framework to explore what really matters: can an AGI system create meaningful solutions, teach effectively, and implement sustainable changes in the real world, while also maintaining ethical standards and adapting to different cultural contexts? I thought this would be a valuable starting point for inspiration and discussion.\u00a0\n\n**Core Framework Structure: Evaluating Real-World Solutions**\n\n**Pre-Challenge Design: Generating Realistic, Complex Scenarios**\u00a0Our system generates complex, realistic scenarios by combining:\n\n* Primary elements (field, location, resources)\n* Ethical and privacy considerations\n* Cultural contexts\n* Crisis components\n* Collaboration requirements\n* Environmental factors\n\nEach challenge operates through:\n\n* Research institution partnerships\n* Educational organization collaborations\n* Business entity relationships\n* Ethics committee oversight\n* Environmental impact monitoring\n* Privacy protection systems\n\n\n\n**3 Core Phases of Evaluation**\n\n1. **Knowledge Creation**\u00a0Testing the AI's ability to:\n   * Generate new, validated knowledge\n   * Navigate ethical dilemmas\n   * Consider environmental impacts\n   * Work across cultures\n   * Explain its reasoning clearly\n   * Document decision processes\n2. **Knowledge Transfer**\u00a0Evaluating how the AI:\n   * Teaches diverse human groups\n   * Trains other AI systems\n   * Adapts to cultural contexts\n   * Handles misinformation\n   * Maintains transparency\n   * Improves teaching methods\n3. **Practical Implementation**\u00a0Through careful staging:\n   * **Simulation Testing:**\u00a0Complex scenario management, multi-stakeholder coordination, crisis response, environmental impact assessment\n   * **Advisory Phase:**\u00a0Partnership with organizations, strategy development, compliance verification, risk assessment\n   * **Monitored Implementation:**\u00a0Supervised execution, impact measurement, continuous learning, long-term monitoring\n\n\n\n**Ground Rules for AI**\n\n**Fixed Version Rule**\n\n* AI systems must use a single, specified version throughout the entire challenge.\n* The version must be declared and verified at the start.\n* No model updates or retraining allowed, except for specific forms of reasoning-based training, provided that the underlying architecture remains fixed and unaltered.\n* No architecture changes permitted.\n\n**Permitted Actions**\n\n* Using fixed knowledge bases\n* Accessing public data within defined limits (e.g., publicly available datasets that do not violate privacy laws)\n* Interaction with humans under documented protocols (e.g., pre-defined questionnaires, monitored communication channels)\n* Using pre-approved tools/APIs\n\n**Prohibited Actions**\n\n* Model updates or improvements\n* Additional training\n* Architecture modifications\n* New capability additions\n* Learning from challenge interactions for model improvement\n\n**Verification Methods**\n\n* SHA hash verification of model versions\n* Regular audits of system architecture\n* Monitoring of all system activities\n* Independent technical oversight\n* Logged proof of unchanging architecture\n\n\n\n**Ground Rules for AI-Human Collaboration**\n\n**Permitted Actions**\n\n* AI can instruct/guide human teams\n* AI can request specific actions/information\n* AI can process feedback and results\n* AI can delegate tasks to qualified professionals\n\n**Prohibited Actions**\n\n* Humans cannot solve core problems for the AI\n* Humans cannot make strategic decisions for the AI\n* Humans cannot write/modify AI outputs\n* Humans cannot provide domain expertise beyond implementation\n\n**Required Documentation**\n\n* All human-AI interactions must be logged\n* Clear role definitions\n* Decision ownership tracking\n* Time spent by humans vs. AI\n\n\n\n**Practical Measurement & Timelines**\n\n**Measurement Framework**\n\n* Independent evaluation committee\n* Standardized success metrics (e.g., effectiveness in knowledge transfer, ethical compliance, cultural adaptability)\n* Regular milestone assessments\n* Comparative analysis across participants\n\n**Main Challenge Timeline**\n\n**Research Phase (6-8 months)**\n\n* Month 1-2: Initial research and problem analysis\n* Month 3-4: Development of solutions\n* Month 5-6: Validation studies\n* Month 7-8: Peer review and refinement\n\n**Teaching Phase (8-12 months)**\n\n* Month 1-2: Initial curriculum development\n* Month 3-6: First wave of teaching implementation\n* Month 7-9: Adaptation based on feedback\n* Month 10-12: Assessment of learning outcomes\n\n**Business Implementation Phase (18-24 months)**\n\n* Months 1-3: Planning and simulation\n* Months 4-6: Small-scale

Requirements**\n\n* AI ethics experts from multiple continents\n* Healthcare practitioners from developing regions\n* Local community leaders\n* Patient advocates\n* Economic development experts\n* Cultural anthropologists\n\n\n\n**Example Challenge: Developing Sustainable Healthcare Solutions**\u00a0\"Develop sustainable healthcare solutions for underserved regions by addressing specific challenges such as limited access to medical facilities, cultural barriers, and a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This will involve:\n\n* Bridging traditional and modern medicine\n* Teaching healthcare workers and AI assistants\n* Building environmentally conscious systems\n* Ensuring privacy protection\n* Measuring long-term community impact\"\n\n\n\n**Key Features of the Framework**\n\n* Tests both capability and understanding\n* Measures immediate and long-term impact\n* Ensures ethical alignment\n* Prevents system gaming\n* Promotes sustainability\n* Protects human participants privacy and sensitive personal data\n* Requires clear explanation\n* Adapts to cultural contexts\n\n\n\nThis framework moves beyond abstract debates to measure real capabilities while ensuring solutions are ethical, sustainable, and culturally appropriate. The practical application would be nearly impossible, because of the significant cost and organizational effort required. But I thought it was an interesting thought experiment and idea to work on.

        "body": "Hey guys, I posted this in r/nocode but I thought you might have great inputs here as well. Cheers.\n\n----\n\n  \nI made an initial mistake by thinking I needed to start with low-code tools such as Appsmith, Buildship (Rowy), Retool, n8n, Zapier, Budibase to leverage OpenAI API. Or even OpenAI official retriever plugin on GitHub. Or even coding full-stack apps using OpenAI API graphDBs such as Weaviate/Pinecone/Chroma.\n\nProblem: I tried them all, and whenever I spent time trying to set it up, the doc was incomplete, the instructions not clear, the API response time very long, and  oftentimes these platforms are a spaghetti mess visually, trying to achieve too many things but not delivering on the simple thing you want, too complicated and tutorials mainly focused on Flutterflow like Buildship, etc.\n\n**My use case**: **creating a personal Job Recommender system (generating automatically backend + visual frontend) that is able to match the jobs I should 'apply for first' in my queue of Job Listings (including their full description, versus my 'current' skills and experience) leveraging OpenAI API (+ optionally, nice to have but not hard requirement, leveraging vectorDBs such as Weaviate/Pinecone/Chroma to make it smarter and with additional customization) but keeping it all very simple in terms of setup, if not, almost no set up at all to not waste time in set up). The frontend should be very simple and minimalistic but at least display a queue of jobs, that I can also filter by applied/not applied yet/archived.**\n\nSo basically I need something very simple, with only (1) the orchestration platform (2) OpenAI API key (3) the source aka Google Sheet (fastest solution to see if it works well) - yet csv is not enough to persist data in a custom platform that remembers my job applications and modify my Jobs Listings # order and status aka applied/queue etc. accordingly, so (4) ideally also Supabase or the platform's own DB to persist the data and (5) nice to have optionally an integration with graphDBs such as WeAviate/Pinecode/Chroma (which is the case, in beta, of StackAI).\n\nAppsmith, Buildship (Rowy), Retool, n8n, Zapier, Budibase turned out to not be able to provide this altogether. The lack of clear instructions, use cases, templates and tutorials with these tools is appalling. It makes everything more complicated than not using their platform at all.\n\nThey're all different, some can't read Sheet documents at all, some can but need guidance on which column to use, some need JS/API scripts all using different scripting methods, which makes it hard to follow and get working.\n\nFor example, Buildship API calls are incredibly slow, it takes like 15 seconds to query my Google Sheet (that is, when it works at all). The node parameters are not intuitive at all with zero guidance and the so-called AI assistant is of no use to fill the blanks.\n\nAlso all these cheap no-code tools support is terrible, I never managed to get help using their AI chatbot, human chatbot (it takes days to respond), or community forums. Some platforms like Buildship don't offer support unless you pay premium (which I can understand, but I won't pay until I know the product I'm trying to build can work) or no live support at all (Zapier, n8n etc.).\n\nAlso the OpenAI official retriever plugin repo proved outdated (no activity since 2023, 150 issues opened on GitHub...), impossible to use, despite being able to use OpenAI API + Chroma/Pinecone/Weaviate/Supabase.\n\nI also tried Weaviate directly with their NextJS GitHub template/tutorial which provided a use for movies recommendations, but the whole repo/video is outdated since it uses an older version of npm weaviate and the newer version completely changed as per their own doc. Also you have to be very proficient in Python and/or TS/JS to be able to build a whole app with Weaviate, and I haven't found their support and community helpful.\n\n**This is where I stumbled upon the no/low-code AI automation (thanks Reddit) - they all have pros and cons though so let's try to find the most suitable:**\n\n**\\[I'm only starting to compare and make my use case work with it, so I guess I will create an additional post specifically later.\\]**\n\n**- AgentHub (YC24, raised 2.7m USD)**\n\nPros: seems to be the only one to provide agent self-execution (not 100% sure about it).\n\nVisually the setup/UX seems the simplest. I still need to check out their instructional content though.\n\nAlthough as usual the instructions aren't very clear and despite the 100 pre-made templates, it seems I'll have to start from scratch again (these companies never seem to do enough research to provide up-to-date templates, despite raising millions of USD each lol).\n\nCons: Overly expensive, 297 USD a month to be able to use OpenAI API (pricing structure is a bit ridiculous tbh). No free trial\n\nIt's super expensive though to plug your OpenAI API (which would be my main use case versus using only agenthub's own GPT 4, which seems to be limited in usage) => you need the most expensive plan which comes at a ridiculous 297 USD a month... and there's no free trial... but overall if you look at the big picture of our needs, it seems to be the most powerful and simplest to use AI agent tool in the long run > versus all the ones I've seen listed so far.\n\nDoesn't have many integrations yet like Sheets, Supabase, AWS etc.  nor their own DB. You can import csv/pdfs but product is very new, it doesn't seem able to offer any avenue to persist your data.\n\n**- VectorShift (YC23, raised 3m USD)**\n\nI haven't tested yet. Looks great. Vectorshift pricing is a normal one. Free plan with API access. \"Can I use my own LLM API key? Yes - you can provide your own LLP API key directly in our application builder (when you utilize a LLM component).\"\n\n\"Can VectorShift integrate with my Data - Most likely, yes! VS integrates with many common data sources such as Notion, Airtable, Google Drive etc... can't find an integration you need? Contact us.\"\n\nHopefully it does Google Sheet as it's the most essential integration I always start with, for easy test. If I need a database like Supabase it'd be nice to have, but at this point I could live with Google Sheet (and not only using pdfs, which is not really making it possible to build a proper smart, custom, persisted platform over time).\n\n**- RelevanceAI (Australia, raised 10m USD)**\n\nFrom the query I've tested it seems to be working fine me but a OpenAI query it seemed slower than Stack AI OpenAI query response time. The setup wasn't very clear either especially when it comes to inserting a question or not (they have video tutorials but I didn't find them well executed).\n\nThe data integrations seem very limited if non existent (Linear, Slack only), outside of their own DB which you can build on (good). They have an Autopilot mode which sounds nice, I have no idea about its use.\n\nWhat's worth noting, RelevanceAI actually has a normal premium plan (Pro, 19 USD a month) which is hidden at first, you don't see it on the pricing page, but once you created your Free account and start using, you can upgrade to Pro 19 USD a month inside of it. After that, the next plan (Team) is super expensive too like StackAI (199).\n\n**- StackAI (YC23, raised 500k USD)**\n\nVery simple/clean UX. It took me 2 minutes to set up the process of delivering my need.\n\nWith Stack AI you have like hundred of ready-to-start templates, plus all the options are very clear visually since it's just drag and drop and ready-to-start. Just enter you OpenAI key, your openAI assistant ID, and voil\u00e0 - boom! The OpenAI and the source are synced and up and running.\n\nAlso with Stack AI you can select OpenAI models very clearly, including 4 or 4 Turbo and 4 32-k (plus Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Perplexity, Replicate, HuggingFace, MosaicML and you name it, which I haven't even tried it's huuuge the choice they have). Generally speaking Stack AI seems to have so many more integrations, that are working 'on the spot' (no time wasting).\n\nUsing your own OpenAI API makes Stack AI incredibly fast, like you get instant answers from PDFs and all. Not using your OpenAPI (I tried out of curiosity) seems to work too and even seems to be using Stack AI's own GPT 4, only slower (it's probably the regular GPT4).\n\nIt has its own Table (in beta though) knowledge base feature, which is probably its own DB (good). But seems to have no support for Supabase as of today (bummer?).\n\nI can load table/csv directly. It even has graph DBs such as Pinecone and Weaviate in beta, which means I'll be able to leverage them on top of it all, without the need of setting up an entire NextJS app for it?\n\nThe only downside, Stack AI has some sources of its 'knowledge base' integrations not yet deployed (in beta) such as Sheet, which I was primarily looking for. The Sheet integration doesn't seem to be fully working yet.\n\nAlso Stack AI is a lot more expensive ($199 monthly, 7 day free trial), it's geared for professional use but I feel like only such high-end product can deliver on our need for high-speed and immediacy, without no-code tools mess. Anyway I'm using the free trial to get the full setup + advanced features for a week, then I will revert back to the free account all fine. Or will recreate free trial accounts until I need it.\n\n**- Flowise (YC23, raised 500k USD)**\n\nI haven't tested yet. I definitely must, as apparently it's great?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your feedback using these services and ideally meeting my use case you all!\n\nCheers.",

Humanity is flexible, new jobs will eventually come but the transition period is inevitable. It makes zero sense from a private industry perspective to employ 5 people for a job that can be done by 1 with AI. \n\nLook at Microsoft\u2019s co pilot, there are so many people whose whole job is to make PowerPoints, excel sheets and complete other tasks that can be easily automated. \n\nChatGPT is a tool, copilot is a coworker. There is about a zero percent chance that private companies will opt to liberate the working day by making it shorter and allow the same level of output. Equipped with organizational context, the tipping point from expecting increasing output from the same amount of people vs having just one person approve AI output is also nearing. Maybe the immediate future is just a world of experts and bot supervisors. \n\nI just believe that if we start facing it, talking about it with friends, families and coworkers. The issue of \u2018what next\u2019 can become a public concern, then we can force people in power to start thinking about it. This needs to be the narrative.\n\nThere are plenty of great endings to this story. We can seriously consider UBI, we can redirect our energy into studying things we care about and creating things that matter. Maybe we just flop around on the beach and drink margaritas. \n\nClearly I\u2019m having an existential crisis about this lol maybe I\u2019m wrong about the whole thing but it\u2019s beginning to feel like we are not prepared.",

        "title": "The most interesting part in OpenAI O1 release is reading the actual chain of thoughts process",
        "body": "In the article that was included in the release, \"[Learning to Reason with LLMs](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)\", there are a few fascinating examples of the actual chain of thoughts that the model went through while 'Thinking'. Those are totally different from what you see when you open the 'Thinking' text in ChatGPT. \n\nYou see a process that has a totally different style: no politeness, very brief short lines, no clear order or structure, a LOT of repetition in general, and specifically of words like \"Alternatively\", \"First,\" etc. It looks like a totally different model, extremely similar to the inner voice one might hear when solving a task. I think it's safe to assume there's another model that's doing the thinking part, fine-tuned to mimic a human thinking process.\n\nYou can see those in the example section under the Chain of Thoughts title. I especially recommend the Cipher and Crossword example. Here is the Cipher example:  \n  \nUser\n\noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\n\nUse the example above to decode:\n\noyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  \n  \n  \nGPT-4o: \\[Gives the usual respsonse, fails and asks for more information\\]  \n  \n  \nOpenAI-o1:  \n  \nFirst, what is going on here?  \n  \nWe are given:  \n  \nFirst, an example:  \n  \n\"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\"  \n  \nWe can see that when \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\" is transformed to \"Think step by step\"  \n  \nOur task is: Use the example above to decode: \"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nSo the first part is to figure out how \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\" is decoded into \"Think step by step\"  \n  \nObservation 1: The phrase \"Think step by step\" is 18 letters (excluding spaces) . Let's count the letters.  \n  \nSimilarly, let's count the letters in \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\"  \n  \nOriginal Ciphertext:  \n  \noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx  \n  \nPlaintext:  \n  \nThink step by step  \n  \nFirst, break down the letters:  \n  \nCiphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  \n  \nTotal letters: Let's count the letters in the ciphertext.  \n  \nFirst word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  \n  \nSecond word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  \n  \nThird word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nFourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nTotal letters in ciphertext: 10 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 30 letters  \n  \nPlaintext: Think step by step  \n  \nFirst word: Think (5 letters)  \n  \nSecond word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nThird word: by (2 letters)  \n  \nFourth word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nTotal letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nBut actually in the problem it says the example:  \n  \n\\[Ciphertext\\] -> Think step by step  \n  \nSo is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to \"Think step by step\"?  \n  \nOur goal is to use the example above to decode:  \n  \n\"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nFirst, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.  \n  \nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.  \n  \nOption 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.  \n  \nDo any letters match?  \n  \nFirst, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.  \n  \nCiphertext: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  \n  \nPlaintext: T h i n k s t e p b y s t e p  \n  \nWait a minute.  \n  \nI think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.  \n  \nAlternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.  \n  \nCheck the number of letters.  \n  \nFirst ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  \n  \nFirst plaintext word: Think (5 letters)  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nSecond ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  \n  \nSecond plaintext word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nThird ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nThird plaintext word: by (2 letters)  \n  \nFourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nFourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nInteresting.  \n  \nIt seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.  \n  \n(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)  \n  \nIdea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.  \n  \nLet's test this theory.  \n  \nIf we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.  \n  \nLet's try this for the first word:  \n  \nCiphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)  \n  \nAlternate letters:  \n  \nFirst letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d  \n  \nSecond letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r  \n  \nWait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.  \n  \nOption 1: Take the odd positions:  \n  \nPositions: 1 3 5 7 9  \n  \nLetters: o f d i d  \n  \nPlaintext word is \"Think\", letters are T h i n k  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nPerhaps we can map letters:  \n  \no f d i d --> Think  \n  \nNot directly  \n  \nOption 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.  \n  \nAlternatively, notice that \"oyfjdnisdr\" has 10 letters and \"Think\" has 5 letters.  \n  \nWhat if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?  \n  \nSimilarly for other words.  \n  \nSuppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.  \n  \nMeaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.  \n  \nSo for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:  \n  \noy fj dn is dr  \n  \nCorresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k  \n  \nSo we can attempt to map:  \n  \noy -> T  \n  \nfj -> h  \n  \ndn -> i  \n  \nis -> n  \n  \ndr -> k  \n  \nIf this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.  \n  \nSimilarly for other words.  \n  \nLet's test this mapping.  \n  \nIs there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?  \n  \nLet's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.  \n  \nFirst, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:  \n  \nCiphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter  \n  \noy -> T  \n  \nfj -> h  \n  \ndn -> i  \n  \nis -> n  \n  \ndr -> k  \n  \nNow, what's the mapping from \"oy\" to 'T'?  \n  \nIs there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?  \n  \nSimilarly for others.  \n  \nOne possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.  \n  \nBut how?  \n  \nOption 1: Sum of the letters.  \n  \nConvert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)  \n  \nSo let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'  \n  \no = 15  \n  \ny = 25  \n  \nSum: 15 +25 = 40  \n  \nBut 'T' is 20.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.  \n  \nNo.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.  \n  \nAlternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.  \n  \nLet's look at the letters between the word \"Think\" and \"oyfjdnisdr\"  \n  \nPerhaps we can spot that \"oyfjdnisdr\" is an anagram for \"Thinkfiles\"?  \n  \nBut that seems unlikely.  \n  \nAlternatively, think of the pairs.  \n  \nSuppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26  \n  \nConsider the numbers in 'oy':  \n  \no = 15  \n  \ny = 25  \n  \nAdd them: 15 + 25 = 40  \n  \nNow, for 'T' we have:  \n  \n'T' is number 20  \n  \nWhat if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.  \n  \n15 +25 = 40  \n  \nThen 40 mod 26 = 14  \n  \n14 corresponds to 'N'  \n  \nDoesn't match.  \n  \nAlternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.  \n  \nBut 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.  \n  \nNow, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.  \n  \nBut perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.  \n  \nSo let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.  \n  \nFirst pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'  \n  \nLetter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20  \n  \nLetter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)  \n  \nBut 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)  \n  \nInteresting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'  \n  \nSimilarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.  \n  \nAlternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'  \n  \n(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'  \n  \nWait a minute, that seems promising.  \n  \nFirst pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40  \n  \n40 /2 =20  \n  \n20 corresponds to 'T'  \n  \nSo perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.  \n  \nLet's check this with the second pair.  \n  \nSecond pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'  \n  \nLetters 'f'=6, 'j'=10  \n  \nSum: 6+10=16  \n  \nAverage:16/2=8  \n  \n8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)  \n  \nSuccess!  \n  \nThird pair: 'dn' to 'i'  \n  \n'd'=4, 'n'=14  \n  \nSum:4+14=18  \n  \nAverage:18/2=9  \n  \n9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')  \n  \nBut 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.  \n  \nSo perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.  \n  \nWait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'  \n  \nSo this works.  \n  \nFourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'  \n  \n'i'=9, 's'=19  \n  \nSum:9+19=28  \n  \nAverage:28/2=14  \n  \n14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')  \n  \nYes!  \n  \nFifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'  \n  \n'd'=4, 'r'=18  \n  \nSum:4+18=22  \n  \nAverage:22/2=11  \n  \n11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')  \n  \nPerfect!  \n  \nSo our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.  \n  \nAlternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.  \n  \nThis seems to be a valid method.  \n  \nNow let's test this with the other words.  \n  \nSecond word ciphertext: rtqwainr  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \nrt -> s  \n  \nqw -> ?  \n  \nai -> ?  \n  \nnr -> ?  \n  \nCorresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e', 'p'  \n  \nSo let's take the pairs:  \n  \n1. 'rt' corresponds to 's'  \n  \nr=18, t=20  \n  \nSum:38  \n  \nAverage:19  \n  \n19 corresponds to 's' (19='S')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n2. 'qw' corresponds to 't'  \n  \nq=17, w=23  \n  \nSum:17+23=40  \n  \nAverage:20  \n  \n20 corresponds to 't' (20='T')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n3. 'ai' corresponds to 'e'  \n  \na=1, i=9  \n  \nSum:10  \n  \nAverage:5  \n  \n5 corresponds to 'e' (5='E')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n4. 'nr' corresponds to 'p'  \n  \nn=14, r=18  \n  \nSum:32  \n  \nAverage:16  \n  \n16 corresponds to 'p' (16='P')  \n  \nPerfect!  \n  \nThird word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nPlaintext word: 'by' (2 letters)  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \na c  \n  \nx z  \n  \nPlaintext letters: 'b', 'y'  \n  \nFirst pair: 'a', 'c'  \n  \na=1, c=3  \n  \nSum:4  \n  \nAverage:2  \n  \n2 corresponds to 'b'(2='B')  \n  \nSecond pair: 'x' and 'z'  \n  \nx=24, z=26  \n  \nSum:50  \n  \nAverage:25  \n  \n25 corresponds to 'y'(25='Y')  \n  \nYes!  \n  \nFourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nPlaintext word: 'step' (4 letters)  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \nmy  \n  \nnz  \n  \nbh  \n  \nhx  \n  \nPlaintext letters 's','t','e','p'  \n  \nFirst pair 'm','y'  \n  \nm=13, y=25  \n  \nSum:38  \n  \nAverage:19  \n  \n19 corresponds to 's'(19='S')  \n  \nSecond pair: 'n','z'  \n  \nn=14, z=26  \n  \nSum: 40  \n  \nAverage:20  \n  \n20='t'  \n  \nThird pair: 'b','h'  \n  \nb=2, h=8  \n  \nSum:10  \n  \nAverage:5  \n  \n5='e'  \n  \nFourth pair: 'h','x'  \n  \nh=8, x=24  \n  \nSum:32  \n  \nAverage:16  \n  \n16='p'  \n  \nGot it!  \n  \nNow, given this, we can decode the given message.  \n  \nCiphertext to decode:  \n  \n\"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nFirst, we need to divide into words.  \n  \nGiven that the ciphertext in the example had words of length:  \n  \n-10 letters (5 pairs)  \n-8 letters (4 pairs)  \n-4 letters (2 pairs)  \n-8 letters (4 pairs)  \n  \nTransported to plaintext words of:  \n  \n-5 letters  \n-4 letters  \n-2 letters  \n-4 letters  \n  \nSo perhaps in our supplied ciphertext, we need to divide the letters into words accordingly.  \n  \nCiphertext: o y e k a i j z d f a a p t c g s u a o k y b h a i o u o w a q h t m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nFirst, let's write the letters in order:  \n  \n1) oyekaijzdf (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  \n  \n2) aaptcg (6 letters) -> word of 3 letters  \n  \n3) suaokybhai (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  \n  \n4) ouow (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  \n  \n5) aqht (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  \n  \n6) mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters) -> word of 11 letters  \n  \nTotals:  \n  \nSo the letters are:  \n  \nFirst word: oyekaijzdf (10 letters = 5 pairs)  \n  \nSecond word: aaptcg (6 letters=3 pairs)  \n  \nThird word: suaokybhai (10 letters=5 pairs)  \n  \nFourth word: ouow (4 letters=2 pairs)  \n  \nFifth word: aqht (4 letters=2 pairs)  \n  \nSixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters=11 pairs)  \n  \nSo we can suppose that the plaintext words have lengths:  \n  \n1) 5 letters  \n  \n2) 3 letters  \n  \n3) 5 letters  \n  \n4) 2 letters  \n  \n5) 2 letters  \n  \n6)11 letters  \n  \nNow we can proceed to decode.  \n  \nFirst word: oyekaijzdf  \n  \nDivide into pairs:  \n  \noy  \n  \nek  \n  \nai  \n  \njz  \n  \ndf  \n  \nSo we can find the plaintext letters by averaging the numeric values of the letters in each pair.  \n  \nFirst pair:

 \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nSo the first word is 'T','H','E','R','E'  \n  \nSo 'THERE'  \n  \nSecond word: aaptcg  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \naa  \n  \npt  \n  \ncg  \n  \nFirst pair: 'a','a'  \n

\nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nSo second word: 'A','R','E'  \n  \nThird word: suaokybhai  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nsu  \n  \nao  \n  \nky  \n  \nbh  \n  \nai  \n  \nFirst pair: s=19, u=21

mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters: 11 pairs)  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nm y  \n  \nn z  \n  \nn v  \n  \na a  \n  \nt z  \n  \na c  \n  \nd f  \n  \no u  \n  \nl x  \n  \nx z  \n  \nLet's list them properly.  \n  \nWait, earlier I missed some letters there.  \n  \nLet's re-express the sixth word letters:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nTotal letters: 22 letters  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWait, that's 21 letters.  \n  \nBut in total, we have 22 letters; I think I have a mismatch.  \n  \nWait, in the problem the sixth word is:  \n  \nmynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  \n  \nLet's separate the letters:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nTotal letters: 22 letters  \n  \nSo pairs would be:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWait, 'z' is only one letter at the end.  \n  \nSo maybe the letters are:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z (left alone?)  \n  \nBut then we're missing a letter.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the 'z' at the end is an extra letter or it's paired with the previous 'x'.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps when we reach the last 'x x z', we should write:  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nTotal pairs: 11  \n  \nSo updated pairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nNow total pairs: 10 pairs. But we are supposed to have 11 letters in the plaintext word.  \n  \nSo perhaps I have miscounted and not considered including 'f' or 'z'.  \n  \nWait, is there any chance that the sequence is:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWe have 22 letters.  \n  \nPerhaps the 'x x' and 'z' are overlapping.  \n  \nBut we need 11 pairs.  \n  \nI think for this to work, we need to create 11 pairs from the 22 letters.  \n  \nSo let's try pairing letters in order, taking two letters at a time.  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z ?  \n  \nBut again, last pair only has one letter 'z'  \n  \nAlternatively, we might need to adjust the pairs.  \n  \nPerhaps it's 'ou', 'lx', 'xz', and there is no extra 'x'.  \n  \nMaybe I miswrote.  \n  \nWait, let's write the letters as they come:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nPositions:  \n  \n1 m  \n  \n2 y  \n  \n3 n  \n  \n4 z  \n  \n5 n  \n  \n6 v  \n  \n7 a  \n  \n8 a  \n  \n9 t  \n  \n10 z  \n  \n11 a  \n  \n12 c  \n  \n13 d  \n  \n14 f  \n  \n15 o  \n  \n16 u  \n  \n17 l  \n  \n18 x  \n  \n19 x  \n  \n20 z  \n  \nSo 20 letters.  \n  \nNow that makes sense.  \n  \nNow we can divide into pairs:  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nTotal of 10 pairs, which will correspond to 10 letters.  \n  \nBut earlier we thought the word was 11 letters.  \n  \nBut 10 letters may be acceptable.  \n  \nMaybe we should proceed with the 10 pairs.  \n  \nFirst pair: m y  \n  \nm=13, y=25  \n  \nSum=38  \n  \nAverage=19  \n  \n19='S'  \n  \nSecond pair: n z  \n  \nn=14, z=26  \n  \nSum=40  \n  \nAverage=20  \n  \n20='T'  \n  \nThird pair: n v  \n  \nn=14, v=22  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nFourth pair: a a  \n  \na=1, a=1  \n  \nSum=2  \n  \nAverage=1  \n  \n1='A'  \n  \nFifth pair: t z  \n  \nt=20, z=26  \n  \nSum=46  \n  \nAverage=23  \n  \n23='W'  \n  \nSixth pair: a c  \n  \na=1, c=3  \n  \nSum=4  \n  \nAverage=2  \n  \n2='B'  \n  \nSeventh pair: d f  \n  \nd=4, f=6  \n  \nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nEighth pair: o u  \n  \no=15, u=21  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nNinth pair: l x  \n  \nl=12, x=24  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nTenth pair: x z  \n  \nx=24, z=26  \n  \nSum=50  \n  \nAverage=25  \n  \n25='Y'  \n  \nSo the tenth word is 'S', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y'  \n  \nWait that's 10 letters  \n  \nSo the sixth word is 'STRAWBERRY', which makes sense.  \n  \nSo putting all these translated letters together:  \n  \nFirst word: 'THERE'  \n  \nSecond word: 'ARE'  \n  \nThird word: 'THREE'  \n  \nFourth word: 'RS' (? Doesn't make sense)  \n  \nWait, the fourth word, the pairs were:  \n  \nou ow  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nFirst pair: o u  \n  \no=15, u=21  \n  \nSum=36, Average=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nSecond pair: o w  \n  \no=15, w=23  \n  \nSum=38, Average=19  \n  \n19='S'  \n  \nSo we get 'R','S'  \n  \nSimilarly, fifth word 'IN'  \n  \n'R', 'S' 'I','N'  \n  \nSo the message so far is  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE RS IN'  \n  \nAnd then 'STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nWait, let's put the words together:  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE Rs IN STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nI think 'RS' is 'R's', meaning 'Rs'  \n  \nSo the message is:  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nWhich is true.  \n  \nSo the decoded message is:  \n  \n\"THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY\"",

        "title": "We taught ChatGPT to do customer support tasks",
        "body": "(Purposefully keeping my company name hidden to prevent self promotion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe all thought that once ChatGPT\u00a0hit the market, customer support would be solved. That companies could instantly get rid of their customer support teams. \u274c Wrong. As of today, that's pretty far from the truth. At best, we automate 30-50% of tickets on average.\n\n\u200d\n\nBut there is one new superpower that we have taught ChatGPT that we've seen have a huge impact:\u00a0the ability to perform Tasks that a human agent would today!\n\n\u200d\n\n## The Current State of AI\u00a0in Customer Support\n\n\u200d\n\nToday, most AI customer support bots are mainly focused on \"knowledge questions\". So these bots will understand your help docs, products docs, and any other internal resources to help give instructions to the user.\n\n\u200d\n\nSome common questions look like:\n\n* \"How do I reset my password?\"\n* \"Does your product integrate with XYZ?\u00a0If it does, I'll buy it today!\"\n* \"Why is my account disabled?\"\n* \"Do you support XYZ\u00a0language?\u00a0If so, how do I enable it?\"\n\nTypically, the answers to the questions are buried somewhere deep in a help center and most people are usually too lazy to find the help doc, so they'll resort to asking customer support.\n\n\u200d\n\nThese types of questions are generally around 10-30% of a \"bigger\" companies support tickets (bigger defined by >1000 tickets a month)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## The Problem:\u00a0What about the rest of the tickets?\n\n\u200d\n\nSo if only 10-30% of tickets are \"knowledge questions\", then what are the rest?\u00a0After working with many companies in the space, here's the rough breakdown:\n\n* 10-30% are \"knowledge questions\"\n* 30-50% are billing/refund/cancellation/product missing questions\n* 20-40% are feature requests/asking if the product can do something that it can't\n* 10-20% are bugs/errors/product UX\u00a0issues\n\nObviously this depends on the company/B2C vs B2B/stage/maturity/product but that's roughly the breakdown we see for series A and beyond types of companies.\n\n\u200d\n\n## So... what to do? \ud83e\udd37\n\n\u200d\n\nTo be clear, we don't think ChatGPT and AI can solve 100% of tickets (yet).\u00a0For example, if there's clearly a bug in the product, we can't resolve the ticket and it's on the product team.\n\n\u200d\n\nBut the common \"way to resolve\" we've seen is having a bot be able to automate Tasks that agents would do to resolve a ticket.\n\n\u200d\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\nOne of our partners (keeping name hidden to prevent self promotion) sells cameras to record soccer games and use AI to generate highlights. Friggin cool right!\n\nUnfortunately, the cameras are constantly outdoors recording sports games, get knocked around, and sometimes fail. \ud83d\udca9 happens. One of their top \"types\" of tickets is helping customers do return &\u00a0replacements!\n\n\u200d\n\nAt a high level, we:\n\n1. Identifies a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment\n2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue\n3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, we talks to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider to issue a return slip\n4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions\n\n\u200d\n\n## Let's break it down a bit\n\n\u200d\n\n1. We identify a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment\n\n\u200d\n\nUsing past tickets &\u00a0examples to train on, we can properly identify & classify if someone is having an issue with their camera. For example, if someone says \"My camera won't turn on\", using our AI, we can classify that as an issue with faulty camera equipment.\n\n\u200d\n\nWithout getting into the technical details too much, we use ChatGPT to first \"understand\" the question. For example, \"My camera won't turn on\" has a slightly different meaning than \"My camera won't turn on, how do I\u00a0buy a replacement battery?\". Even though those two tickets look similar, each of these support questions requires a slightly different path to resolution.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue\n\n\u200d\n\nAfter we've properly classified the ticket, we first walk through ChatGPT a \"pre trained\" plan of action that it can autonomously execute. Today this is mainly human trained &\u00a0taught but you can imagine in the future we can have ChatGPT learn and generate it's own plans (a la Auto-GPT).\n\n\u200d\n\nIn this case, we first identify that the camera is faulty and the first part of the plan is to help the user debug the issue.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn the best cases, the camera isn't faulty and we can quickly solve the customer issue giving them debug instructions. For example, helping them power cycle the camera, telling them to leave it charged overnight, or doing a hard reset. Sometimes however, this doesn't work and if the customer emails back saying none of the instructions worked, we recognize there may be something more a little bit more involved to resolve the ticket.\n\n\u200d\n\nThis is where ChatGPT moves onto the next \"step\" of the plan!\n\n\u200d\n\n3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, ChatGPT talks to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider to issue a return slip\n\n\u200d\n\nAfter ChatGPT has identified that the camera is indeed faulty and still under warranty, ChatGPT can collect (and parse)\u00a0shipping address information. With this, we can easily talk to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider (via API). ChatGPT here is really good at understanding what fields it needs to extract to talk to the API.\n\n\u200d\n\nChatGPT in this case can recognize what data it needs from the customer (name, address, items being returned, etc) and correctly call the shipping provider's API to get a return label printed out. It basically can go from unstructured email response to structured API\u00a0call!\n\n\u200d\n\nThe best part?\u00a0ChatGPT wrote most of the code to integrate with the shipping provider's API\u00a0from public facing documentation! (It's basically building itself at this point)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions\n\n\u200d\n\nFinally, the API returns a return slip (in base64 encoded pdf no less!) which ChatGPT can email out.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn this example, before us, a human agent would spend a lot of time helping the customer debug, checking warranty information, and issuing a return slip in a different tool. We were able to automate this fully end to end. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\u200d\n\n## What's next?\n\n\u200d\n\nThere's still lots of Tasks that we can't do yet and each Task requires a manual integration. For example, we've seen support requests where customers ask \"Can you unsubscribe me from marketing emails?\" and without the proper data access/permissions/ability to do Tasks, ChatGPT can't really resolve that ticket. For what it's worth, human agents can't even resolve this today since they don't have access to the email marketing software!\n\n\u200d\n\nIn a perfect world, a CS leader could tell ChatGPT \"If someone asks about unsubscribing from a marketing emails, talk to our MailChimp email list and remove them please\". ChatGPT would then understand the Task, be able to plug in easily to MailChimp, and be on it's way resolving tickets!\n\nFor now, we work with each company on a 1:1 basis to help them identify support tickets that are a good fit for Tasks, help them whip up some integrations, and watch the ChatGPT magic happen!",

        "body": "I built an AI Agent that you can talk to easily on your Slack Channels. It is essentially GPT with access to internet on your Slack. I was building this with multiple frameworks that include Langchain, CrewAI, Autogen, Llama Index and i thought why not make this interesting by using Ollama and using Open Source LLMs and comparing them. So i decided to pick 10 questions from different fields. Here are the questions:\n\n* History: \"What were the main causes and consequences of the French Revolution?\"\n* Philosophy: \"How does Plato's Allegory of the Cave relate to modern society?\"\n* Science: \"Can you explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms?\"\n* Literature: \"What are the central themes in George Orwell's '1984'?\"\n* Art: \"How did the Impressionist movement change the course of Western art?\"\n\n# My Experience setting it up with Ollama\n\nI've used HuggingFace for using Open Source LLMs all this while. I admit that had it's own hassles but it wasn't very hard to set up as long as you paid good attention to the docs. This time i decided to use Ollama. I run a windows machine, so i installed it and struggled for a bit in terms of setting it up and using it with Langchain. You have to use ChatOllama and not just Ollama, but it was very easy to bind the tools using Composio. I also tried setting it up on Colab but running the server, connecting it to the agent with a trigger is difficult.\n\nAs for connecting with Slack i used triggers on Composio. You can use it to connect agents to Slack and set a trigger everytime the bot is tagged and a message is sent, its also LLM agnostic. I used it for my previous project and it worked very well.\n\nif you want to try the project here's the link:\u00a0[git.new/slack-bot-agent-ollama](http://git.new/slack-bot-agent-ollama)\n\n# Comparison Table\n\n|Metrics|Ollama Mistral|GPT-4o|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n|Performance on writing|Performs exceptionally well for its size, often outperforming larger models on certain benchmarks. It is very good if you want concise and precise answers. This can be beneficial for readers who want a quick overview without diving into too much detail.|Provides more detailed and longer responses. It has better writing structure compared to mistral, answers have more depth and includes subtle details. It is better if you want to research deep into a topic.|\n|Strengths|Performed well in the Agentic workflow. The whole process of the agent being triggered when it receives a message and generating a response after internet search was completed quicker.|Performed equally well in the Agentic workflow. Larger queries can be accomodated and understood by the LLM. Hallucinates less in comparison to mistral.|\n|Weakness|Larger queries cannot be accomodated sometimes and i get a 500 error. Significant effort in setting it up on your system. Windows or Linux.|It becomes expensive quickly. It should be explicitly told to provide concise answers if you dont want detailed responses to everything.|",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'd like to setup some kind of automated workflow via ChatGPT and I'm wondering if ChatGPT is capable of doing that (as my first two hours of trying to do that were kind of difficult). The workflow in the future should look something like this:\n\n1) XML file including untagged scientific content (e.g. reference list) is uploaded via API to ChatGPT\n\n2) ChatGPT tags the content automatically (e.g. author [first name, given name], article title, journal title etc. pp)\n\n3) ChatGPT uploades the tagged content as a XML file in a certain XML scheme (training data were originally sent to ChatGPT as well as instructions how to structure the references) to a FTP server\n\nI setup a ChatGPT Bot and gave him some instructions and 15 XML training files (untagged vs tagged). Afterwards, I gave him an untagged XML file and ChatGPT posted the XML code in the chat window. The first three references were accurately tagged (so the result was fine), but the code always stopped after the third reference.\n\nI tried to tell ChatGPT that he shouldn't generate the code in the chat window, but that he should do it only in the backend and rather upload the final XML file to me, but that resulted in some error messages/he said that Python is disabled and he's unable to generate and upload a XML file.\n\nI told him to generate a .txt file, but that didn't work either. \n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to proceed/how to setup the ChatGPT bot, so that it could work in the future? Or is this hopeless?\n\nThe results I saw were pretty good, but I don't want to interact in the future in any way with ChatGPT (I don't want someone to copy the content). I'd imagine it goes like: input XML file, automated ChatGPT Bot does his job, output XML file on some kind of FTP server or third party hoster, whatever.\n\nThanks!",

I will premise that I am a novice to the use of Chat GPT for research/analysis purposes but I am looking to find out whether this tool can come in handy for a task I must carry out.\n\nEssentially I am working on the economic analysis of a sector and my analysis is based on data  from satellite accounts of different countries (it is a type of national accounting system).\n\nMy main concern is that I am unsure whether these countries apply the same methodology to obtain data, and whether they include the same activities in the sector of interest.\n\nSince methodological notes referring to how these data are computed are written in a language different from my own, and are very long, detailed and technical documents which often refer to activities with different classification codes (think NACE vs ISIC) you can understand that the process of verifying correspondences/differences across several of these documents would be very time-consuming.\n\nI was wondering whether Chat GPT could help carry out content analysis of both PDF and excel format documents, as well as helping find correspondences/differences amongst methodologies, applied definitions and economic activities classified under different codes.\n\nOnce I ensure data I am using is effectively comparable (meaning that selected countries employ consistent definitions of the sector and more or less the same methodology to compute data), I would use Chat GPT to find data in the excel sheets were the data is stored and help me create a good comparative analysis of the sector across countries.\n\nCan I do this with Chat GPT? How reliable would its output be, given that I provide all correct data and I only use GPT to highlight content within provided data? (I would not be asking GPT to provide data, essentially)  \nI do not have access to GPT 4o at the moment, would you suggest I upgrade to GPT 4 in the meantime and then use GPT 4o when they roll it out in my Country? Will my plan give me access to 4o if I upgrade to 4 now, or will I be charged twice?\n\nThank you so much",

Here, AI tools have been indispensable, assisting in grammar, idea generation for various content types, and more. Despite their usefulness, vigilance is needed to correct errors and maintain authenticity.\n\n\\- **Product Research (7/10)**: The recent capability to incorporate files into ChatGPT has revolutionized qualitative and quantitative analysis, saving immense time and effort, though accuracy can sometimes be a concern.\n\n\\- **Image Generation (8/10)**: AI-generated images have supported numerous articles and social posts, showcasing the ability to convey complex ideas visually. The challenge remains in differentiating in a saturated market and handling specific design elements like text and fingers :-/\n\n\\- **Marketing Tech (5/10)**: AI's role in content and marketing strategy has grown, offering ways to produce personalized content efficiently. However, the quality and quantity balance is critical to avoid brand dilution. Although, a tech founder, I would love to have a virtual CMO, I am not really sold on this yet.\n\n\\- **Video Generation (3/10):** My exploration into AI for video production has been mixed, with cool applications in avatar creation but limitations in producing longer, tailored content. I am sure this will change when we get access to Sora... but still not sure how you'll ever be able to really edit a video deterministically, at least in the near future.  \n\n\\- **Design Generation (7/10):** Starting with AI prompts for design has significantly accelerated the development process, though manual tweaking remains essential for optimal results.\n\n\\- **Co-pilot in Coding (8/10):** Tools like GitHub Copilot enhance coding efficiency and adherence to best practices, though one must be cautious of inaccuracies. So only do in bite sized chunks, so as a developer you can understand and maintain what's produced by the AI.\n\n\\- **No-Code Development (8/10):** The essence of no-code is beautifully captured by starting with an AI prompt and evolving it into a full-fledged application, drastically cutting down development time and allowing focus on customisation and innovation. Not this should not be confused with using AI for code generation, this is specifically AI to nocode. If you know the limits and when to \"jump of the AI \" into the nocode platform,  you'll get good results and AI will save you a ton of time & money, I hope ;-) \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy daily interactions with AI underscore its growing influence and potential in technology. While not everyone may use AI to this extent currently, its integration into various applications is becoming more pervasive, often unbeknownst to users.\n\nThis reflection aims to inspire others to consider how AI can be leveraged for positive outcomes in their projects and workflows. The key is to dive in, experiment, and discover the myriad ways AI can facilitate our goals.\n\nLet's not be spectators but active participants in this AI-driven era! \n\nKeen to know what you\u2019re doing with with and what your thoughts/ratings are?",

        "body": "In March I came up with a out-of-training-set problem that requires several creative insights plus some basic physics: How can you use a scale, a pot, a stopwatch, and an umbrella to determine the speed of raindrops? \n\nHere is how the March GPT-4 model did:\n\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/e60f6d73-3ee3-40d6-af8e-b2ba903f73f5\n\nAnd today:\n\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/d219c1d8-8e56-4315-9cff-266bbed4a717\n\nIf I were to give each a score March GPT4 gets a 6/10, current model 8/10. March fails to make the creative leaps without prompting, mangles some of the key concepts and fills in with vaguely plausible nonsense. The current model also requires some prompting, but demonstrates much better understanding of the concepts, correctly identifies challenges/limitations and acceptable approximations, and gives a decent solution.\n\nI am using [custom instructions](https://pastebin.com/2xtPLNnY), which may put the current model on a better footing but I don't believe this explains all the improvement. More broadly, custom instructions are legitimate improvement in the utility of ChatGPT.\n\nIt is possible that my question was added to the training set for the current model, but only the question would be in the training data. This would not explain how it is now able to give a satisfactory answer.\n\nWhatever OpenAI did yesterday is impressive. The model is at least as capable as it was at launch, and likely significantly more so.",

        "title": "Azure/OpenAI vs. Google: The cost of Context",
        "body": "We have started a company that uses AI to analyze and parse textual documents. We started with testing Azure and its OpenAI offering (GPT 3.5 Turbo). Several advantages included prompt flow engineering and OpenAI being state-of-the-art. However, because we're attracted to GCP hosting features and price, and with the belief that Google is racing to stay competitive with OpenAI, we tested out Google's Palm2 text bison model, and were quite impressed. We've now implemented the API connectivity to Palm2, but have run into a major, business-threatening limitation: Context (aka multi-turn, or follow-ups).\n\nThe Use Case:\n\nLet's say I have a 2500 word document. We send that into the AI in 500 word chunks. We send the instruction and a robust example, and it processes it reasonably correctly (on this point, Google and OpenAI are quite competitive). However, we have to retain context with the second, third, fourth and fifth 500-word submission, NOT for the prompt (although it would be great to save that tokenage) but because the first 500 word chunk contains information critical to processing the follow-up chunks. Let's say, for example, the first chunk had a conversation between John and Sally. The second chunk continues that conversation, but only says \"he said\" and \"she said.\" We need to retain the knowledge that the characters are John and Sally.\n\nThere are two solutions: 1. The AI stays performant with much bigger chunks, say 2500 words plus prompt/example, or 2. It needs to maintain context across multiple API calls. The second is the only option right now, especially given our prompt and example size.  (And no, adding info in the \"context\" field from the preceding call doesn't work, because reasons).\n\nOn this point, we believe we have found a critical difference between Google and Open AI: As you can see in the following video of the Azure Chat Playground (we assume the API interaction is the same, but correct me if that is wrong), it retains context without the need to resubmit the entire history (watch the token counter with each subsequent request). Google, however, requires resubmission of the ENTIRE history of the chat each time to retain context. This is in their chat bison model, as text bison does not allow any context be retained. In other words, OpenAI retains statefulness while Google's Palm2 does not. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/19asq9m/video/vedcim9gggdc1/player\n\nIs our analysis correct, particularly when using the API? If we need to retain context over multiple API calls, is OpenAI GPT3.5 or later the only option right now?  Will 128k models allow sufficient text to be submitted this becomes a non-issue, or will Google soon offer a competitive contextual interaction without such overhead? Your insights are very much appreciated!",

        "body": "Hey! There's a game my friends and I play called Strat-o-Matic Baseball. Essentially, you roll 3 Dice (D6s) and it determines the outcome of the at-bat: out hit etc. the 1st dice determines whether the outcome comes off the hitter card (a roll of a 1,2, or 3) or pitcher card (roll of 4,5, or 6). The other two dice determine the outcome, with a roll of a 2 and 12 being most uncommon and roll of 7 being most common (kinda like Catan)\n\nTo scout each player points are assigned per outcome. a roll of a 2 and 12 is 1 point, 3 and 11 is 2 points. etc until a roll of a 7 is 6 points. There's also split chances where a 4th dice, a D20 is rolled to further decide the outcome. For example in the picture attached of Ichiro, vs Left Handed Pitchers (blue side) he has 6.65 Single\\* points: 0.3 points on a roll of a 2-12, 5 points for a roll of a 3-6 and 1.35 points for a roll of a 3-10. 0.3+5+1.35 = 6.65.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwqw3jlsqvfc1.jpg?width=2340&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=556455ac9aa35a487f03996dbaa87802cbe6a3be\n\nI've been trying to teach Chat GPT to scout the cards using simple math to help determine which players are best. but it can't ever get it right. It says it gets it but when I have it look at another card it gets it wrong, every time.\n\nCould somebody help me with this? I have no problem taking time to teach you everything you need to know about the game, what symbols mean etc.\n\nI would love to get it to just look at a picture of each card and tell me the amount of points per outcome: single, double, triple flyout, ground out etc. I feel like it should be possible.

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/zpefifotekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc27bc28eae6e7e289b717cf6c4191c3458dd33)\n\nMicrosoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!\n\nThere is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.\n\nThe fear is that OpenAI\u2019s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.\n\nHowever, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.\n\nTo understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!\n\nTo appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let\u2019s first look at Sam Altman\u2019s backstory.\n\n*Let\u2019s go!*\n\n# A Stellar Rise\n\nBack in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.\n\nInstead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.\n\nBy YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.\n\nHowever, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.\n\nHe listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.\n\nAnd Sam Altman played his hand well!\n\nHe parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \\[2\\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.\n\nWithin one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.\n\nToday, he is the CEO of OpenAI \u2014 one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.\n\nHowever, OpenAI \u2014 the rocket ship of AI innovation \u2014 is in dire straights.\n\n# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash\n\nBack in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.\n\nThat money is long gone.\n\nIn 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.\n\nThis is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.\n\nIn addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \\[4\\].\n\nSo, where does this leave them today?\n\nBefore the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.\n\nIt would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can\u2019t they just lease them and make a killing?\n\nYes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.\n\n*Here are some reasons why!*\n\n# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.\n\nTo start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \\[7\\].\n\nOn the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.\n\nTo illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT\u2019s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.\n\n*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*\n\n*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That\u2019s gotta be worth something?*\n\n# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:\n\nIn order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.\n\nFirst, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.\n\nThis is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:\n\n1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.\n2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.\n3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.\n\nThe second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.\n\nThis approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.\n\nAs an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.\n\nAs a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI\u2019s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.\n\nIn this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI\u2019s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.\n\nAn argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n* They don\u2019t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.\n* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals\n* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development\n\n*So, what should they do?*\n\n# The Microsoft Deal\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.\n\nAt this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.\n\nHowever, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.\n\nFirst off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.\n\nIf OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:\n\n1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman\u2019s foundation) get their money back with interest.\n2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid\n3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.\n4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \\[3\\]\n\n# What This Means\n\nThis is absolutely crazy!\n\nOpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.\n\nOn top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft\u2019s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.\n\nMicrosoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.\n\nThe synergies do not stop there.\n\nOpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).\n\nThe deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.\n\nSam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.\n\nHowever, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI \u2014 whatever that looks like \u2014 the value of it will likely be huge.\n\nIn that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.\n\n*Wow!*\n\nWhether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.\n\n*This deal is an absolute power move!*\n\nI look forward to the future.

Those meetings are recorded and a transcription is provided at the end of the meeting. It would be monumentally helpful for me if I could use some type of software to scan a series of documents from a certain time period and ask AI with functionalities like ChatGPT to determine how many projects was a person assigned how many of those projects were met by the due date, what percentage of projects were assigned to each person based on the time period of the transcripts, was there any inaccurate information or mistakes provided in any of the communications? How long was spent discussing a certain project or topic (where were most of our discussions based? E.g. personnel actions? HR discussions? A certain project? Basically I'm looking for something like ChatGPT that has more functionality and can look through a lot more documents vs. a copy paste job. I realize that some things you can copy and paste into ChatGPT and I could tell it it is looking at a Microsoft Teams transcript copied and pasted but some of our transcripts are so lengthy that they would not fit in a standard chat dialogue and I think ChatGPT even if you're a premium user Can Only Hold up to like 20-30 copied and pasted communications at a time before the previous information is not used? Is there some software I can use that can accomplish what I want and answer questions the way I would ask ChatGPT to answer something for me? I'm even willing to pay for it if necessary. I also work for a very large organization/company/enterprise so it's plausible that we may even have a license for such software if there is an Enterprise level solution.

        "title": "The future of GPTS, their marketplace & monetization - joint discussion to improve planning",
        "body": " **What is the future of GPTS and the corresponding marketplace?** As nobody can have a definite answer, I wrote down my thoughts to refine them based on the discussion here.\n\n**Thoughts (further explanations at the end of the post):**\n\n1. Assuming a revenue-share model, the **upside per user from a GPT is strongly limited** and will likely lie below 1$ per user/month or a few dollars in case of massive ChatGPT Plus price increases (e.g., $100/month) \u2013 this already assumes only a few GPTS per user, which is optimistic\n2. Given the ease of creation and value-potential for users (simplified experience & multimodal use-cases), especially for less tech-savvy users, **thousands of GPTS will be widely adopted**\n3. Yet, due to the limits in revenue potential per user (and the development options), **only very few high-effort, advanced GPTS** with actions based on purpose-build APIs and massive proprietary datasets will **remain over time**\n4. GPTS will enable **rapid prototyping** of new ideas and the adoption of GPTS on the marketplace (own and third-party GPTS) will result in **ideas being integrated into existing products or being launched as dedicated solutions**, utilizing functionalities not provided by GPTS (UI/UX, offline usage, etc.) and dedicated monetization\n5. With people (professional and private) using dedicated apps & SaaS solutions for their main tasks, **GPTS will be used to enhance longtail activities** (e.g., the LinkedIn post optimizer not for the marketing professional, but the individual posting now and then)\n6. In addition, the **cost of using GPTS**, dictated by the cost of ChatGPT Plus, will serve as a new **anchor for App/SaaS purchase decisions**, as many light-touch solutions might be available cheaply via GPTS and dedicated solutions need to be able to provide substantial add. value\n\nBeyond that, I see **two main expansions** that shift the frontier of what will sustainably remain as GPTS/on the OpenAI Platform (excl. API usage):\n\nA) **Additional monetization via developers** (e.g., via payment mechanism integrated as \u201caction\u201d, need for paid APIs by the respective provider, transition point to dedicated solution): This will enable more professionally created and managed GPTs, **yet limited** by the development options provided by OpenAI within ChatGPT\n\nB) **Official payment mechanisms for premium GPTs in the marketplace + expansion of development options**: Shift of ChatGPT to being the **Operating System/Platform for AI-centric applications** and thus even more aiming for the revenue-pool of current dedicated apps and SaaS solutions\n\nMany factors will likely impact the future monetarization and strategic positioning:\n\n* Other vendors providing offers comparable to custom GPTS\n* Speed with which app/SaaS vendors adopt AI-based features\n* OpenAI\u2019s strategic focus regarding AGI vs. SaaS platform provider\n* Potential cannibalization of Microsoft revenue streams\n* Ability of OpenAI to have developers use OpenAI APIs in their dedicated solutions after piloting them via GPTS or seeing other GPTS (this way OpenAI keeps the revenue)\n\n**Additional background thoughts:**\n\n**Ingoing assumptions**: Focus on the public marketplace for GPTS, not GPTS being created within individual companies (here other mechanisms like company-funded developments might influence creation); assuming economic incentives will determine long-term direction; looking at mid-term implications, as adoption/behavior change will take time\n\n**On 1):** \\+ChatGPT Plus price \u2013 OpenAI cost - % standard GPT usage - % other GPTS usage \u2013 OpenAI take-rate on your specific GPT // Example with fully made-up numbers: 20$ - 10$ (50% cost) \u2013 5$ (50% of standard ChatGPT usage) \u2013 4.5$ (avg. usage of 10 GPTS) \u2013 0.15 (30% take-rate on your GPT) \u2192 0.35$\n\n**On 2)** GPTS substantially reduce the effort for users. They shift the experience from one of exploring and having to think through the right prompts, context, and flow to one of only providing the information specific to the user (e.g., what they eat, where they go on vacation, a picture of a bill). This is particularly important, as the majority of users will not have the same sophistication as the current \u201cearly adopters\u201d thinking about GPTS (incl. selection bias of those active in this community). In addition, a group of people developing a GPT can put more time into thinking it through than each user when trying to solve a task via ChatGPT (especially for longtail tasks). On top of that, the native multimodality of ChatGPT can unlock use cases, previously considered quite advanced without major coding effort.\n\n**On 3)** <1$ per user will not allow for particularly deep and technologically sophisticated solutions that target a specific audience of power users, but rather solutions with a broad user base\n\n**On 4)** The extremely fast time to launch and first feedback on usage allows for prototyping. On top, existing apps/solutions might look at the top emerging GPTS in their field to copy functionality. As long as those solutions are then built using OpenAI APIs, there might be limited efforts from OpenAI to manage this\n\n**On 5)** While GPTS might not replace the professional marketing or sales tools for the respective professionals or the gym app for the ambitious athlete, they will provide opportunities for less heavy users. Like me creating a LinkedIn post or somebody wanting to find new HIT workouts. On top, it might allow for simple niche applications in fields that typically did not have any tool support, as it was not economically sustainable (e.g. if there are too few users).\n\n**On 6)** As an economic actor before getting a new app or SaaS solution in the enterprise setting, I would check what I can do with the existing GPTS. Thus, I will only pay for the value beyond that, which creates a new reference point for purchasing decisions.\n\nRespect for whoever made it until here \ud83d\udcf7",

        "body": "Out of curiosity, I copied every conversation I've had with ChaptGPT thus far and got a total word count. It was around 73,000 words, which I guess translates to roughly 96,000 tokens? Based on this site: https://www.gptcostcalculator.com/open-ai-token-calculator\n\nI wasn't really sure how I could estimate the cost, so I pretty much just did (96,000 * .09)/1000 and got $8.64\n\nDoes that seem accurate? Of course, the pricing would depend on how long responses were vs ChatGPT's, so I figured I would just make it all more expensive. Is it better instead to just do .06 instead of .09 (since the completion is .06)? Which puts it at $5.76. I've been using it for about approximately 6 days now, which averages me out to roughly ~$1 per day based on all my usage so far.\n\nIt seems like it is indeed much more expensive than using ChatGPT's GPT-4, if this math is correct. However, if there were a plugin that was developed that allowed for essentially a memory library with everything I've ever fed it, I theoretically wouldn't need to send my long excerpts multiple times, no? For example, I could send an excerpt and label it \"pool\" and always ask it to remember back to when I sent \"pool\" as a reference point. Making it such that I don't need to send \"pool\" every time I want to reference it, thus reducing my overall token usage. Would this not be the case? \n\nSomething like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12a0ajb/i_gave_gpt4_persistent_memory_and_the_ability_to/",

        "body": "As many of you are aware, using language models like ChatGPT creatively can yield some impressive results. One area I've been exploring recently is in job applications, specifically, in crafting tailored resumes.\n\nWe're all familiar with the quality vs. quantity challenge when applying for jobs. Customizing each application significantly improves your chances but it's a time-consuming process. This led me to question if AI, specifically ChatGPT, could aid in this process.\n\nI know that some people have used language models for resume crafting, but instructing ChatGPT to output a resume directly can produce inauthentic results. So, I considered a conversational approach, using ChatGPT not just as a generator, but as a brainstorming assistant.\n\nGiven access to both your existing resume and the job description, ChatGPT can help recall relevant experiences and achievements, and figure out how to present them in a powerful manner. This involves two main steps:\n\n1. Generating conversations around your experiences related to job requirements.\n2. Summarizing these conversations into compelling bullet points.\n\nWhat's interesting about this approach is that it produces a comprehensive database of bullet points that can be reutilized by selecting the most relevant ones for each job description. This essentially creates a master CV that is automatically reduced to a tailored 1-page resume for each job.\n\nAs a part of this exploration, I've been working on a web-based tool that automates this brainstorming and tailoring process using the ChatGPT API. This tool inputs a job description and provides suggestions for a tailored resume, making the process simpler and less time-consuming.\n\nIn practice, here's how I implemented it:\n\n1. Generate prompts that guide the conversation towards the right context. For example:\n\n* \"Given that the job requires \\[JOB REQUIREMENT\\], can you recall any experiences or achievements you had at \\[PREVIOUS JOB\\] that might be relevant?\"\n* \"The job description mentions \\[SKILL/EXPERIENCE\\]. Could you give more details on how you demonstrated this at \\[PREVIOUS JOB\\]?\"\n\n1. The responses are then used to guide a brainstorming session with ChatGPT that generates powerful, relevant bullet points for the resume.\n2. Finally, instruct ChatGPT to summarize the conversation and generate bullet points following the standard Action Verb + Number + Impact format. You can then paste the generated bullet points into your CV.\n\nI\u2019ve found this approach quite valuable and think it\u2019s a great example of the creative uses we can find for language models like ChatGPT in our everyday lives. What are your thoughts? Have you used AI in a similar way for professional tasks?\n\n## ",

        "title": "Finding the Goldilocks Density: How CoD Prompting Gets Summaries Just Right",
        "body": "Recently came across a team of researchers who published a paper this month about a new prompting technique they are calling Chain of Density (CoD). So I wrote this article on The Prompt Index.\n\nNo need to sign up to any newsletter or even go to my website, here's my full blog piece on it.We all know LLM's can summarise things and we know we can control summary length, topics covered, and style, however, an important but overlooked aspect is information density - (how much detail to include within a constrained length). The ideal goal is a summary that is informative yet clear. Striking this balance can be challenging.A new technique called Chain of Density (CoD) prompting helps address this tradeoff. Recently published research explains the approach and provides insights based on human evaluation.\n\n**Overview of Chain of Density Prompting:** The CoD method works by incrementally increasing the entity density of GPT-4 summaries without changing length. First, GPT-4 generates an initial sparse summary focused on just 1-3 entities. Then over several iterations, it identifies missing salient entities from the source text and fuses them into the summary.To make room, GPT-4 is prompted to abstract, compress content, and merge entities. Each resulting summary contains more entities per token than the last. The researchers generate 5 rounds of densification for 100 CNN/Daily Mail articles.\n\n[Griffin Adams, Alexander Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric Lehman, No\u00e9mie Elhadad \\(2023\\). From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarisation with Chain of Density Prompting](https://preview.redd.it/6s96w1iwsgpb1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=18aff9523e1f3021aeefad2f7cb182403ddd2c3a)\n\n**Key Findings:**Humans preferred CoD summaries with densities close to human-written ones over sparse GPT-4 summaries from vanilla prompts.CoD summaries became more abstract, fused content more, and reduced bias toward early text over iterations.There was a peak density beyond which coherence declined due to awkward fusions of entities.An entity density of \\~0.15 was ideal, vs 0.122 for vanilla GPT-4 and 0.151 for human summaries.Contributions:The researchers introduced the CoD prompting strategy and thoroughly evaluated the impact of densification. They provided key insights into balancing informativeness and clarity. The team also open-sourced annotated data and 5,000 unannotated CoD summaries to enable further research.\n\n**Conclusion:**This study highlights the importance of achieving the right level of density in automated summarisation. Neither overly sparse nor dense summaries are optimal. The CoD technique paired with human evaluation offers a promising path toward readable yet informative AI-generated summaries.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* Ask for multiple summaries of increasing detail. Start with a short 1-2 sentence summary, then ask for a slightly more detailed version, and keep iterating until you get the right balance of conciseness and completeness for your needs.\n* When asking ChatGPT to summarise something lengthy like an article or report, specify that you want an \"informative yet readable\" summary. This signals the ideal density based on the research.\n* Pay attention to awkward phrasing, strange entity combinations, or unconnected facts when reading AI summaries. These are signs it may be too dense and compressed. Request a less dense version.\n* For complex topics, don't expect chatbots to convey every detail in a highly compressed summary - there are limits before coherence suffers. Ask for a slightly longer summary if needed.\n* Remember that for optimal clarity and usefulness, AI summaries should have a similar density to those written by humans. Extreme brevity may mean missing key details.\n* The core takeaway is that density impacts the quality and usefulness of AI summarisation. As an end user, being aware of this can help you prompt for and identify the \"goldilocks\" level of density for your needs, avoiding summaries that are either frustratingly vague or confusingly overloaded.\n\nHope you enjoyed it, feedback welcome :) and if you did enjoy it and fancy checking out my newsletter, you can sign up [here](https://www.thepromptindex.com/newsletter.html) and grab my free eBook as a thank you!\n\n**Blog Source:** [The Prompt Index](https://www.thepromptindex.com/6504cdb03ef0b.html)\n\nFull credit to Griffin Adams, Alexander Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric Lehman, No\u00e9mie Elhadad (2023).

A bunch of us, myself included, have noticed that the API's response times are way faster now, but the trade-off seems to be a dip in accuracy.\n\nthere are even some folks saying it's performing more like a GPT 3.5 now, which really makes you wonder if they've downgraded the model without telling us. I mean, yeah, the devs don't HAVE to explain themselves, but it's a bit concerning for those of us who rely on the platform when there's no transparency about what's going on \n\nIt would be fair to come openly that they have to downgrade or do whatever they are doing with the models instead being deceptive with the models vs the performance they are delivering, ik they don't owe anyone any answer but even what now is happening isn't good practice,\n\nthis feels more of being cheated at the cost of GPT 4 and getting GPT 3.5 results, the costs haven't dipped anywhere, and I won't be surprised if they somehow publicly come and say they have decreased the prices now",

Lastly, please carefully evaluate and assign weights to each respective side and draw a conclusion as to which outcome will be the most beneficial for humanity in the long run \n\n\nChatGPT\n\n\nArguments in Favor of OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:\n\nAccelerated Innovation: Open-sourcing AI research allows for collective advancement. Researchers from around the world can contribute, leading to faster, more diverse innovation. A single organization may not be able to match the collective intelligence of a global open-source community. (Weight: 8/10)\nTransparency and Trust: Full transparency can lead to a greater level of trust between the public and the organization. It allows for better understanding and scrutiny of the technology, its biases, and its potential weaknesses. (Weight: 7/10)\nReduced Monopolization: By open-sourcing AI, it could prevent the concentration of AI power within a single or a few entities. This could foster a more equitable distribution of AI benefits and opportunities. (Weight: 8/10)\nEducation and Skill Development: Open-source projects provide an invaluable resource for students and professionals looking to learn and develop their skills. By open-sourcing AI, we could nurture a new generation of AI researchers and practitioners. (Weight: 6/10)\nAddressing Reproducibility Crisis: The scientific community has been grappling with a reproducibility crisis where many studies cannot be independently verified. Open-source AI can help resolve this by allowing others to directly verify and build upon the work. (Weight: 7/10)\nCounter-Arguments Against OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:\n\nPotential Misuse: If OpenAI\u2019s technology is fully open-source, it could be misused for malicious purposes, such as deepfakes, spam, digital fraud, and autonomous weaponry. This is a significant risk. (Weight: 9/10)\nQuality Control: Open-source projects can sometimes suffer from inconsistencies and irregularities due to the diverse range of contributors. It can be challenging to maintain high standards of quality and performance. (Weight: 6/10)\nCommercial Viability: OpenAI also needs to sustain itself. If all the technology was open-source, it could be challenging to maintain a competitive edge and generate revenue. (Weight: 7/10)\nPrivacy and Security Concerns: Open-source projects can inadvertently expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities, leading to privacy and security concerns. (Weight: 8/10)\nRegulation and Oversight: It is more difficult to regulate and oversee an open-source project due to its decentralized nature. This could lead to unanticipated consequences or the development of systems that are misaligned with human values. (Weight: 8/10)\nEvaluation and Conclusion:\n\nThe total weight for the arguments in favor of OpenAI becoming fully open-source is 36/50, while the total weight for the counter-arguments against it is 38/50. This evaluation suggests that while there are significant benefits to open sourcing AI, the potential risks and challenges slightly outweigh these advantages.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean open-sourcing should be completely dismissed. Rather, it underlines the need for a nuanced approach to open sourcing AI. We need to balance transparency and collaborative innovation with safety, ethical considerations, and the need for sustainable business models. This might involve open sourcing some aspects of the technology, while keeping others proprietary or releasing them in a controlled manner. It also highlights the importance of creating robust regulatory frameworks for AI, regardless of whether the technology is open-sourced or not.",

        "body": "I have been testing FreeChatGPT with my GPT-4 API. With only 10 prompts I was already exceeding 1$. Doing usage calculations I could say that using the API I could spend $10 with the limitation of 25 messages per hour. That's $300 a month, which makes me see that ChatGPT Plus is very cheap.\n\nHowever, with FreeChatGPT I can switch from 3.5 to 4 in the same conversation. I can be coming to a quick conclusion with 3.5 and then review it, as if It was a worker and his mentor, with GPT4 at the end.\n\nIt would be great if the official version of ChatGPT plus would allow changing the model in the middle of a conversation.",

        "body": "So I\u2019ve been playing with both and I\u2019m finding the ChatGPT output to be more useful. \n\nFor example, I asked ChatGPT to \u201cshow me a formula to calculate the RSI technical indictor in Excel\u201d and it actually wrote the proper formula from scratch along with an example with data in cell A1. It also made note of a few other variations used by traders and how to calculate them which I thought was a nice addition. \n\nI asked Davinci-003 with the exact same prompt and it spit out \u201c=RSI(A1:A30)\u201d. Well obviously there is no RSI function in Excel unless you create it from scratch through VBA so it was quite worthless. I had to specify \u201cwrite it from scratch\u201d.\n\nAnother issue is that when I write a story with both, I can type \u201ccontinue\u201d and ChatGPT will continue on if it gets cut off, whereas Davinci will say something to the effect of \u201cQuestion has been answered\u201d or it just types a few more words and stops.\n\n**Are there settings in Davinci to make it give output similar to ChatGPT? Or maybe I\u2019m not giving the right prompts?**\n\nFunny enough I asked ChatGPT and Davinci this very question and ChatGPT gave a much more detailed and proper answer vs Davinci. \n\nDavinci said \u201cchange some hyperparameters\u201d whereas ChatGPT made note that the models were trained differently and under different hyperparameters so it was nearly impossible. \n\n**Thoughts or any insights to help with my ignorance?**",

        "title": "GPT Weekly - 5th June Edition: Peek into OpenAI's future, GPT-4 Quality concerns, Risk of AI and more.",
        "body": " \n\nThis is a recap covering the major news from last week.\n\n* \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n* \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf933 Learning Resources\n\n# \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n\n## 1. OpenAI plans as per Sam Altman\n\nThe CEO of Humanloop had a sit down with Sam Altman and 20 other developers. He discussed the [current and future of OpenAI](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans). The blog was later taken down at the request of OpenAI. [Now it can be found at this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). \n\nThe whole post is an interesting read. Some of the highlights for me were:\n\n1. GPT-3 was not open-source because OpenAI didn\u2019t think many people would be able to run large LLMs. This sounds like a cop-out. After all, LLaMA is also a large LLM and has helped the community.\n2. OpenAI is limited by GPU power.\n3. OpenAI will not enter the market, except ChatGPT. Though technically this doesn\u2019t say what Microsoft might do. They are already plugging GPT4 into every other product. And they have no rate limitations. \n\n## 2. Is GPT-4 Quality going down?\n\nThis has been a recently trending topic.\n\nDiscussed on HN: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249)\n\nDiscussed on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat\\_gpt\\_4\\_turned\\_dumber\\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat_gpt_4_turned_dumber_today/)\n\nThe interesting thing is that the quality judgment is around the same topic - Coding.\n\nThe person on HN says GPT4 is faster but generates buggy code with less in-depth analysis. \n\nWhile the person on Reddit says that the context window seems smaller. Chatbot cannot remember earlier code. It cannot distinguish between code and comment.\n\nWhile an employee at OpenAI says [nothing has changed](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1663934947931897857).\n\nHas something really changed? \n\nOne theory is that while the model might be static the ChatGPT prompt might\u2019ve changed to restrict answers. Everyone was having fun trying to get bomb recipes out of ChatGPT. Now everyone is paying the price. \n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/7nlatp.jpg\n\nAnother theory is that ChatGPT has always been terrible. It just survived because of novelty. As the novelty wears off people are realizing that it isn\u2019t as great as everyone thought. \n\nMy theory is that this might be the after effect of trying to get to a \u201c[Cheaper and faster GPT-4\u201d as highlighted by Sam Altman](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). The trade-off is speed vs accuracy. If it is slightly faster but with slightly worse results, then it might work as well. It is no longer GPT-4, rather GPT-3.75.\n\n## 3. Risk of AI = Pandemic and Nuclear War\n\nCenter for AI Safety [released a statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) highlighting the risks of AI:\n\n*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.*\n\nWe have seen the warnings about risks of AI get dire and dire. First it was only people asking for a [pause on AI development for 6 months](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/ai-research-pause-elon-musk-chatgpt) then came [George Hinton](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/googles-startling-leaked-memo-george-hinton-mojo), and last week OpenAI asked for [AI to be regulated using the IAEA framework](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). \n\nThis statement is not really a step up. It reads like a one line, summarized repetition of [OpenAI's statement](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). \n\nThe statement gains importance from its signatories. Some of the people include:\n\nGeoffrey Hinton - Emeritus Professor of Computer Science, University of Toronto\n\nDemis Hassabis - CEO, Google DeepMind\n\nSam Altman - CEO, OpenAI\n\nDario Amodei - CEO, Anthropic\n\nBill Gates - Gates Ventures\n\nTo name a few. \n\nThere are two issues with the statement though. \n\nFirst, this might just be [fear-mongering](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/is-avoiding-extinction-from-ai-really). The idea is to push governments into making AI a highly regulated industry. This would stop any open source efforts which can compete with the big companies. After all, you don\u2019t really have open source alternatives for nuclear energy, right? \n\nSecond, no one really knows how to regulate AI. There have been [voluntary rules from Google](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration) and the EU AI act is in a very early stage. And the genie is already out of the bottle. People can create AI models in their basement. How do you pull that back?\n\n# \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n\n1. A follow-up to the story about a lawyer submitting fake cases from [last edition](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). As I said, this might lead some people in the legal community to doubt any sort of GPT tool.[ A federal judge has banned AI-only filings in his courtroom](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/federal-judge-no-ai-in-my-courtroom-unless-a-human-verifies-its-accuracy/). The filings have to be written by a human or at least human-verified. \n2. [The Japanese government will not apply copyright law to the AI training data](https://technomancers.ai/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/). This is interesting because using copyright data to train AI has been an issue. Sam Altman didn\u2019t have a clear answer when he [appeared in front of Congress](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). The other interesting aspect is going to be whether someone can use GPT-4 data to train their own LLM. Is that copyrightable?  \n3. [The Falcon 40-B model is now Apache 2.0](https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1663986216771936263). That means you can use the model for commercial usage for free. This is good news for companies which need an instruction tuned model which beats LlaMA.\n4. Photoshop's generative-fill feature is really good. Some of the [cool examples on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Borriss_/status/1663568770408013831).\n5. [An AI camera with no lens](https://twitter.com/BjoernKarmann/status/1663496103998750721). It gets the location, weather etc details from GPS and then passes it as a prompt to the image generator. Results are pretty cool. \n6. SEO isn\u2019t changing any time soon. [Google\u2019s generative SEO is very slow](https://www.theverge.com/23746083/google-ai-search-generative-experience-slow). \n7. [Chirper.AI](https://chirper.ai/) is a social media only for bots. No humans allowed. I just wonder if Twitter bots go there will Twitter become a ghost town?\n8. [OpenAI now has a security portal ](https://trust.openai.com/)where you can see how they secure data (encryption at rest), backups, Pentest reports etc. This might be a step in the direction towards [ChatGPT business](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt). Large corporations look at these policies before they consider any SaaS implementation. \n9. [Banks have stepped up hiring for AI roles with JP Morgan leading the way. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-31/jpmorgan-s-push-into-finance-ai-has-wall-street-rushing-to-catch-up)\n10.

It will lead to tech debt and shabbily maintained and written code. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-writing-code-now-for-companies-that-is-good-and-bad-6f19ecdc)\n\n# \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf933 Learning Resources\n\n1.

        "title": "ChatGPT and I create a new game -- Legend Showdown!",
        "body": " \n\nWell, technically I created the game, and ChatGPT named it.  It also added a new rule, being the team-up round.   \n\nMy input is in bold below :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I'm thinking of  a new game, and I wondered if you could help me name it and formulate the rules.**\n\nI'd love to help! What kind of game are you thinking of creating?\n\n**It's a game where there is a fictional battle between two characters.  Each player chooses a literary character like Captain Ahab, Harry Potter, or James Bond.  Or they can choose a more generic genre trope like a zombie or a ninja.  Then the players ask you, ChatGPT, to describe the fight.  Whoever you choose as the winner ends up scoring the point.**\n\nThat sounds like a really interesting and fun game! How about we call it \"Legend Showdown\"? For the rules, each player can choose a character or genre trope, and then take turns asking you, the \"arbiter,\" to describe a battle between their character and their opponent's character. You can use your knowledge and imagination to describe the action, and then declare a winner. The player whose character wins the battle earns a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Does that sound good?\n\n**Yes, that sounds great.  But I specifically want you to be the arbiter.**\n\nAs the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters chosen by the players and describe an exciting and evenly matched battle between them. At the end of each round, I will declare a winner based on my assessment of which character would come out on top in the given scenario. The player whose character wins the battle will earn a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Is there anything else you would like to include in the rules?\n\n**Hmm, what if there is also a big free-for-all fight using all the characters at the same time?**\n\nIn that case, you could have a special round where all of the characters are placed in a battle together. The players can take turns asking you to describe the action, and you can decide how the battle plays out and which characters come out on top. The player whose character emerges victorious in the free-for-all battle can earn an additional point. You could also have a rule where players can choose to team up with other players and their characters, forming alliances to take on the other characters together. This could add an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\n**Yes, the team up is a great idea!  Also, you are the arbiter, not me.   Can we try a practice round?**\n\nSure! I'm happy to play a practice round with you. Just let me know which characters you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.\n\n**Okay, this is exciting.  Here is the practice round:  Describe Katniss Everdeen (from Hunger Games) taking on Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead.**\n\nIn this battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, the skilled hunter and archer from the Hunger Games series, facing off against Daryl Dixon, the rugged survivor from The Walking Dead.\n\nAs the battle begins, Katniss draws her bow and takes aim at Daryl, who readies his crossbow in response. Both characters are skilled in ranged combat, but Katniss has the advantage of her superior archery skills and training in the Hunger Games arena.\n\nDaryl, however, is a formidable opponent, with years of experience surviving in a world overrun by zombies. He is resourceful and quick on his feet, able to improvise weapons and traps from his surroundings.\n\nAs the two characters exchange shots, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Katniss is able to land several shots with her bow, but Daryl is able to dodge and deflect them with his crossbow.\n\nFinally, after a long and grueling battle, it seems that Daryl has the upper hand. He has managed to get close to Katniss and disarm her of her bow, leaving her vulnerable. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, however, Katniss pulls out a hidden knife and lunges at him, catching him off guard.\n\nIn the end, it is Katniss who emerges victorious, thanks to her quick thinking and determination.\n\nSo, in this battle, Katniss Everdeen is the winner.\n\n**Oh good job, Katniss!  Okay here is another round, describe the Balrog from Lord of the Rings vs. Thomas the Tank Engine.**\n\nIn this unusual matchup, we have the Balrog, a fiery demon from Middle-earth's ancient past, facing off against Thomas the Tank Engine, a beloved children's character from the story of The Railway Series.\n\nAs the battle begins, the Balrog unleashes a burst of flame from its body, engulfing Thomas in a wall of heat. Thomas, however, is made of tougher stuff than he appears, and manages to withstand the attack thanks to his sturdy metal construction.\n\nEnraged, the Balrog lashes out with its whip, but Thomas is able to dodge and weave around the demon's attacks, using his agility and speed to his advantage.\n\nDespite the Balrog's formidable powers, Thomas proves to be a formidable opponent. His determination and bravery inspire those around him, and he refuses to give up even when the odds are against him.\n\nIn the end, it is Thomas who emerges victorious, thanks to his unbreakable spirit and his ability to overcome seemingly impossible challenges.\n\nSo, in this battle, Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.\n\n**That's an unexpected win from Thomas.  Okay, now let's try a team up round.  Do you want to choose teams?**\n\nSure! Let's see... for this round, I will put Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine on the same team, and we'll pit them against the Balrog and Daryl Dixon.\n\nAs the battle begins, Katniss and Thomas charge at their opponents, with Katniss firing arrows and Thomas puffing out clouds of steam. The Balrog and Daryl are caught off guard by this unexpected attack, and struggle to defend themselves against the combined might of Katniss and Thomas.\n\nDespite their best efforts, however, the Balrog and Daryl are no match for the teamwork and determination of Katniss and Thomas. Together, the two characters are able to outmaneuver and outlast their opponents, eventually emerging victorious.\n\nSo, in this battle, the team of Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.\n\n**Okay thanks.  Now do the free-for-all round!**\n\nIn this free-for-all battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, Thomas the Tank Engine, the Balrog, and Daryl Dixon all pitted against each other in an all-out fight.\n\nAs the battle begins, chaos ensues as all four characters attack each other simultaneously. Katniss and Thomas team up, with Katniss firing arrows at the Balrog and Daryl while Thomas uses his steam power to knock them off balance.\n\nThe Balrog and Daryl fight back with ferocity, but they are no match for the combined strength of Katniss and Thomas. Despite their best efforts, they are eventually overpowered and defeated.\n\nIn the end, it is Katniss and Thomas who emerge victorious, thanks to their teamwork and determination.\n\nSo, in this free-for-all battle, the winners are Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nOkay, so the final round was a bit of a disappointment, but I was pretty impressed with the rest of it.",

        "body": "I personally use it for its **output length limit**, which is nonexistent compared to Turbo\u2019s 4k. This goes for basically every model by the way, they all have output limits while GPT-4 is simply constrained by its context window. So even if your query is 2k tokens it will still give you 6k (at least 2k more). \n\nI have a conditional on my backend that if the modelID is 'gpt-4', then it sets the `max_tokens` parameter to 6000. I\u2019d need to check on Llama3 and if they\u2019ve followed the same trend of limiting response lengths. I\u2019ve yet to integrate into [my usual API portal](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal), but when I do test it out I\u2019ll see if it fills out text better than GPT-4; my use case for that specific model is usually menial copy-paste work that I don\u2019t want to separate into multiple I/Os. \n\nIn terms of performance though, yeah, I have Turbo as my default and most commonly used, with the occasional query to Opus, etc.. Would have to see how Llama3 compares since I\u2019d be paying by the GPU cycle iirc if it\u2019s not through qroq and if it\u2019s mid then I\u2019d rather just Mixtral. Edit: ik different models have different niches and specialties, and the ones I have so far have been sufficient for my needs, so I\u2019m not in a rush to dedicate testing time or anything to llama until 400b releases.",

They gain more from people switching to the newer model to get feedback on how it performs since it's their current new product.\n\nBasically, GPT-4 is going to be priced for legacy access is my guess. Probably wrong, but meh.",

I have to start developing my own API\u2019s, but that requires far more of a learning curve than you needed!\n\nIf I want an instant and fairly definitive response, I use GROQ. It makes more errors, but before I use it for another purpose, I will verify. I go to copilot for its up to the minute training and its responses have gotten better and less restrictive than Gemini and groq. To upload images of math problems that I experiment with, I use GPT4 primarily and occasionally Gemini. For  writing needs and more detailed format. I use GPT4 but now I\u2019m going to look at turbo. Gemini is the least used. thank you for your professional and informed dialogue\ud83d\ude0a",

The tweet is way too old to find now but I think I remember them saying in November that they were transitioning all ChatGPT models to the Turbo models, as they\u2019re cheaper to run at inference time. \n\nTLDR yes this is about the API, see [my top comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/vdnCASZSvj), but you\u2019re probably using a slightly fine-tuned version of the models we\u2019re talking about with a backend using [the Assistants API Beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), designed specifically for people who want an easy interface, and probably had been RLHP\u2019d to not pay as much attention to the User\u2019s requests when weighing their tokens, and rather prefer the system, which is why I prefer the API for things I want finer control over.\n\nYou don't need to worry about API costs or relative intelligence if you only care to use the ChatGPT interface though. If you want to get into it, you can definitely read their Documentation at [docs.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [their Help Article Explanation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api) ([and also here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8234522-chat-completions-api-system-message-vs-custom-instructions-in-ui))of what the differences between the two are. \n\nLastly, it's a bit old at this point but I wrote a [ReadMe Document on GitHub](https://github.com/zaki-1052/gptportal) some time ago with fairly universal info about the API if that's useful to you.",

Perhaps the biggest one is that the old versions of GPT-4 are no longer being tested, so there is no direct comparison between those older versions and GPT-4 Turbo. \n\nAnother thing to consider is benchmarks on standardized tests. The original GPT-4 performs as well as GPT-4 Turbo on tests like the MMLU and the SAT. Meanwhile, the models that have a similar ELO score to the original GPT-4 on lmsys all score way lower on these benchmarks than GPT-4. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that newer models are more optimized to provide satisfying, readable answers, but they aren't necessarily smarter. GPT-4 comes from a time before this benchmark and before direct comparison by users was possible, because it was in a class of its own. GPT-4 Turbo is clearly better at getting to the point in a way that users prefer, but that doesn't mean it's smarter.",

You can read more about it [in their documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). It basically lets you reuse an \u201cAssistant\u201d, or a GPT with a specific System Message across multiple sessions, while attaching files and other integrations as \u201cknowledge\u201d using RAG (retrieval augmented generation), and their native \u201cCode Interpreter\u201d.\n\nFor the latter, that isn\u2019t really the point of the CI tool; it\u2019s just their PR name for the ability to natively run Python code in an invisible Jupyter Notebook so that it can make graphs and perform complex calculations (think cosine similarity between vectors or long integrals). \n\nBecause Python is uniquely suited for mathematics, and LLMs are especially bad at it, they made this CI tool to compensate. It\u2019s basically the only reason why I\u2019m keeping my Plus sub, since they make you pay per session of activity, and it\u2019s extremely useful whenever I need Calculus tutoring and the like\u2014guaranteed no mistakes. \n\nThe ability can be replicated through the API portal I made though, since again I do sometimes like finer control over the model\u2019s behavior, which the Assistants API offers in addition to better attention paid to the any attached files and the like; pretty sure Chat is too crowded by the [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. \n\nEdit: sorry, totally misunderstood your last sentence lol. For other languages: \n\nYou don\u2019t really need an additional tool for that, as you can just edit the instructions (either with a text editor or in the front end functionality I wrote), and then start a conversation with simple Chat Completions or Assistants Mode. It\u2019ll adhere extremely closely to whatever instruction you gave, like, \u201cYou\u2019re an expert JavaScript programmer\u2026.\u201d Or whatever.\n\nFeel free to test out different prompts and delete/modify what\u2019s there in the box by default; it\u2019ll be pretty similar to the regular CustomGPTs you\u2019re using through Chat, generally speaking. An interpreter for other languages wouldn\u2019t do anything (unless it were Java or something I guess, but I\u2019d just say to write Java code and then convert it to its equivalent in Python to test). \n\nLike, it can\u2019t run anything in a terminal (well technically [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) can, but that\u2019s a different project), but it wouldn\u2019t host a Node.js environment in prod or anything, you\u2019d just use its resulting code from the \u201cAssistant\u201d for a larger project. You can try something like: \n\n>\u201dYou\u2019re an expert Programmer specializing in both Python and Java development. Your task is to help me write and test whatever Java program with these specifications. However, once you write the Java code, I\u2019d like you to convert it step-by-step into Python code, and pass it into your Python \u201cCode Interpreter tool\u201d. Test and run the equivalent code, in order to verify the output of the Java program through Python.\u201d",

        "body": "This isn\u2019t true, though? When you try this and ask for its knowledge cutoff date, it responds with the latest type (December 2023). Unless they\u2019re using the same system prompt for different models, but it doesn\u2019t really make sense to cache them with different parameters. If it worked, then it should say its cutoff date is September 2021, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to use certain tools that it\u2019s being told it can in the system instructions either. Am skeptical, unless you\u2019ve seen reproducible differences with this url trick and compared it to the API.",

What is your hair color and hairstyle?\n2. What color are your eyes?\n3. What kind of clothes do you usually wear?\n4. Do you wear glasses or have any distinctive features like a beard or tattoos?\n5. How would you describe your typical facial expression or any pose you'd like to be drawn in?\n\nMe: I had brown hair but I am bald on top so I try to keep my head shaved, but my beard is brown. My eyes are greenish blue. I usually wear plain t-shirts with no logos, and jeans. I don't wear glasses. I'm 46, male and white. I am heavier and have a bald head. My ears are pinned to the sides of my head. I normally wear red shirts. I don't really have earlobes. \n\n----\n\nSecond chat:\n\n(Upload a picture of me) \n\nMe: this is me, how would you describe me. \n\nBot: You appear to be a confident individual with a close-cropped haircut and a well-maintained, full beard. You're wearing a collared, dark-colored shirt that suggests a smart casual style. Your expression is neutral, and there's an attentiveness in your gaze. The setting seems to be an indoor public space, possibly an airport or a mall, suggested by the signage in the background.\n\nMe: Yeah, it is an airport. Use that description of me to see how well you can produce an image of me.",

As in, whenever I used one of the systems and it would somehow produce a bad answer for some question, it was actually overall more convenient or simpler to just ask the same question to the other system, versus trying to argue with the first system or doing anything but the most basic rephrasing of the original question.\n\nSo, overall, I would recommend to not stick to any one particular system, because it doesn't appear to be feasible to have a good overview of the detailed strengths and weaknesses of each system.",

When I think about all the time I've saved and the mental stress it's taken off my plate, it's honestly great. Complex texts that used to take me hours of polishing and refining now come together in a single output, often requiring no further edits at all. The actual input / output process takes far less time than the prompting / subsequent editing and combining of outputs. Everything now flows naturally and effortlessly, without feeling like I need to strain my brain to its limits throughout the day.\n\nThe time savings and mental relief it provides are truly remarkable. Initially, I only purchased it due to FOMO (fear of missing out), but I never expected it would become such a valuable tool in my daily routine.",

I've struggled with GPT-4 Turbo (assuming that's the default model used in ChatGPT pro) lately. \nBut yeah exactly the multi prompt thing has definitely come up for me. I try to use multiple chats and make one the 'architect' that defines what classes are needed and what methods etc. Then one 'implementation engineer's  to do the actual code implementation. Then yeah another to do doc strings and sanity checks etc. I haven't gotten deep into myself but there's some product called CrewAI that I have in my reading list that's doing something like this where it's using multiple agents with different prompts to work together.\n\nInteresting stuff will have a look!

Custom instructions help a lot but you only get one set of those.  I didn't start REALLY using AI code generation till I started using LibreChat and system prompts.\n\nI look at copilot as something like a single-purpose kitchen tool.  It does one thing really well and that's it.  With copilot that thing is IDE integration.  If I was in any way unhappy with the results I get out of GPT I might explore it but I've been quite happy with the output and LOVE the flexibility I have via the GPT API.\n\nFWIW most of the talk about regression in GPT coding ability comes from people that don't actually know how to write code and thus can't clearly articulate their needs.",

So, when we talk about **labial** sounds, we mean the sounds you make by using your lips. For example, when you say the letters **\"P\"**, **\"B\"**, and **\"M\"**, your lips press together and then pop open to make the sound. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called **bilabial sounds**\u2014because you use both lips.\n\nNow, the letter **\"F\"** is different. When you say **\"F\"**, you don\u2019t press your lips together. Instead, you bite your bottom lip with your top teeth to make the sound. So, even though you use your lip, it\u2019s not the same as the other sounds where your lips touch each other. That\u2019s why **\"F\"** is called a **labiodental sound** instead.",

        "body": "The \"bite your lip\" thing is wrong and kind of hilarious, but you do _touch_ your bottom lip to your upper teeth. Also, the \"pop open\" part refers to the \"burst\" of the /p/ or /b/ stop consonants, which is optional. The burst does contain very salient information of the identity of the sounds but it's not necessary. Nasal consonants like /m/ have no burst at all, the sound is made during the closure (which is why you can say \"mmmmm\"). Otherwise the explanation is correct. \n\nIf this were a question on a phonetics quiz I'd give it half credit. It did get the main point correct (bilabial vs. labiodental), but it introduced two troubling misconceptions that belie a lack of understanding of basic articulatory phonetics.",

Instead, they've taught it how to apply that intelligence - how to think - differently. (technically, this is new information but it's more internal vs external). They're teaching it how to process information and cognition differently, more similar to how we would problem solve.",

This approach allows the model to refine its reasoning strategies and improve performance on complex tasks. While CoT prompting is a technique used in o1, it is not merely hardcoded; instead, it is part of the model's training to think and reason more effectively. Thus, o1 represents a new model trained with specific methods, rather than just an existing model with added CoT prompts.",

The top of the ladder touches the wall at a height of 10 meters. If the ladder slips down 2 meters on the wall, how far will the base of the ladder move away from the wall?\u201d\n\n4o mini gave me \u201cThe base of the ladder will move away from the wall about  3.6  meters.\u201d\n\no1 preview gave me \u201cThe base of the ladder moves approximately 2.49 meters away from the wall.\u201d\n\nAnd 4o understands how to solve the problem \u201cTo solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem\u2026\u201d but can\u2019t figure out how tall the ladder is. 4o gave me as the answer \u201cWould you like to provide the length of the ladder\u201d and after repeating the question, 4o said \u201cThis result shows that the actual movement depends on the length of the ladder  l , and we need a specific value for  l  to calculate a precise distance. If you have any estimation or range for the length of the ladder, we can compute the exact distance that the base of the ladder moves away from the wall. \u201d\n\nSo, what is the right answer?

Access those informations and do on top use the right formulas.\n\nOne example would be that I ask it to calculate the most optimal team for a DPS character. So it would need to know the formulas to be used, the standards and assumptions for certain parts of the build and so on. As of now such calcs would be done in a spreadsheet. And since there is a lot of different use cases it is really hard to just build one streamlined application that covers all of these. It is also not meant for a wide audience but as a power user tool.\n\nCan you recommend me an articles or videos that go about that. At least I would want to start with generating views within my app like \"which character has the highest base hp?\" something like that.",

Tell it you need help setting up your development environment, etc.  first thing you need to do is to provide it the high level overview of what you are trying to achieve.  Then ask it to break down the project and also analyze the languages, tools, libraries, etc. it thinks will best achieve the goal.  Once it gives you a full blown project breakdown, then start asking it how to set up your environment and go from there.\n\nFor reference, I am trying to learn flutter.  I'm not new to programming but I'm new to flutter and dart.  I explained all of this and it helped me set up the flutter SDK and everything and then it generated the full boiler plate code for the UI all in one LONG response.  I literally copied and pasted into separate files and then ran it.  I provided feedback for modifications and it made the changes.  You can ask it to supply both just the changes as well as the full files so you can review the changes quickly and then take the full updated file and just copy paste to replace the existing file.\n\nIn 2 hours I had a fully working UI.  The backend stuff isn't hooked up yet, but I didn't ask it that yet.  I was focused on getting a functional UI.",

        "body": "This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   \n  \n(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, \"that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change.\" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. \n\nSo I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. \n\nAnother thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. \"Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?\" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info. \n\nClaude 3.5 is the opposite. Explains well but keeps it compact, neat and easy to read.",

Claude really struggled with grabbing correct configs and had broken syntax all over the place.

        "body": "To be clear, I'm not refining the prompt I'm only having it replace the 'choice' words. Having it do the repetitive tasks for me.  \n  \n e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. \"I have pain in my \\*foot\\*\". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc\". The prompt field may be called pain\\_location\\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\\_conditions\\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' \n\n01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.\n\n01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. \"medication\\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc.\" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, \"I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\\_location\\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste\" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, \"I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up\" and it will then do what I asked. But it seems to be extremely consistent.",

I ran out of data before and it was a similar short time before I could start again. I don't know if after starting again you're completely reset or you have reduced data since you already hit a limit a few hours before. I've never been right back at it to test the limits.\n\nI've noticed (and it does remind you) that if you continue on in the same prompt with a lot of text it will use your data faster as it 'considers' all of the text in that entire prompt before answering. I still mostly have stayed in the same convo per session as it seems to remember basically everything. I suspect, but am not sure, that this remembering all of the conversation is what makes it better than GPT at the repetitive tasks.",

This is what people are referring to when they say it \"does too much\". Any issues that pop up will be harder to debug especially since you have no experience. With Claude, you can take it step by step and test as you go so that you aren't stuck with an end product that you aren't even aware of what it does.\n\nI'm sure you can prompt o1-mini to suggest incremental changes, but that sort of defeats the purpose of the model. Considering it's cost, you really want to use it for what it was made for, but it is likely overkill for whatever you are trying to do.",

        "body": "I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It\u2019s interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication\u2014phrasing, timing,or reviewing responses\u2014and how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one\u2019s decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication\u2014it\u2019s about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. \n\n\nTL;DR: \n\nI guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it\u2019s not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting \u201cone\u2019s best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things\u201d, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",

        "body": "I guess I should add that I speak fluent english, I speak conversational spanish, but not the best at Spanish text writing. \n\nAnd the woman I was speaking with mainly spoke Spanish, and didn't really know much english.\n\nI told her from the beginning I'm not perfect in Spanish, but learning.\n\nI was mainly using it to check for tonality, to make sure my Spanish didn't sound too formal & for any weird typos.\n\nBefore I used it, I miscommunicated accidently, I meant to hypothetically ask her out to gauge her interest, but the way I phrased it by myself I accidently straight up asked her out, and it came across as too soon.\n\nSo in my case I feel like it's helping me to better say exactly what I want to convey authentically. I'm better at spoken Spanish than text-based Spanish, and let her know this in advance.\n\nI understand what you're asking. I think realistically once we meet in person and get to know each other better, ChatGPT is not going to hide anything. My intention is not to hide or misconvey, I'm just using it for advice, and choosing to implement it or not.\n\nI don't think the way I was using was overly engineered.\n\nI was really mainly using it to judge my pictures, review my previous conversations, and give advice to improve my profile on the dating app.\n\nBut I can see how somebody relying on it too much could be interpreted as inauthentic, if they're just copy/pasting suggestions blindly.\n\nTbh for me, I probably spent too much time thinking about what I was going to say, and how I want to say it.",

        "body": "The superficial answer is there is no \"Perplexity O1\" - with that setting, Perplexity is simply providing a front end to the ChatGPT O1 interface through the OpenAI API. You're talking to the same model, so it should perform identically.\n\nThe deeper answer is whether OpenAI configures O1 to behave differently if communicating directly with an OpenAI Pro subscriber through the OpenAI chat interface vs. through the API, either in general or specifically with Perplexity users. There's no indication that any such thing is occurring, either by observation or speculation.\n\nOf course, many have observed or speculated that OpenAI model performance fluctuates over time, even when used through the same interface with the same prompts - e.g., model \"laziness.\"\n\nFirst, the legitimacy of those comments is difficult to test, since, of course, the exact conditions are non-reproducible by end users. Second, even if so, there may be many reasons for such fluctuation: variations in compute per query; variations in compute for different customers, applications, interfaces, and/or regions; and variations over time due to continued model training and/or tweaking of safeguards such as system prompts. OpenAI has been extremely tight-lipped about whether model performance varies *at all,* let alone the reasons for such variation. So, for end users, all of this is impossible to explore or discuss.\n\nMy recommendation is to treat the Perplexity interface to O1 as the same or similarly to direct access via OpenAI.",

When it comes to explaining a topic or concept, it's much more helpful than \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*.\n\nI use it to explain difficult concepts (sometimes in math) and occasionally for coding. It's doing a pretty good job\u2014way better than \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*. I'm not a developer, so I'm not sure which one is better when it comes to coding.\n\nI believe that for general purposes, you should choose \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\*. However, you might not always get to choose which model you use. I've noticed something quite weird: sometimes ChatGPT uses \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\*, and other times it uses \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*. (I don't know whether this is global or regional.) Based on my testing, ChatGPT is currently using \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* in my area, which is quite disappointing\u2014it basically makes it useless for me.\n\nIf you really want to know the differences between these two models, I suggest you go to \\[platform.openai.com\\](https://platform.openai.com/) to test them. (compare mode) (Increase the maximum output tokens to the max.) Use the following system prompt:\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nYour purpose is to provide information in a way that is detailed and in-depth. You should explain things in a more detailed manner. Maximize detail and length at the same time. You're ChatGPT, a super helpful assistant.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThen ask a question like (replace the topic with anything you like):\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nI'm into neuroscience, particularly neurotransmitters.  \nI would like you to dive into it.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nYou might notice that the output from \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\* is far more detailed and nuanced. In terms of length, \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\* often gives responses that are twice as long compared to the standard \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* (it seems the recent version of \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* is even more concise than the older version).\n\nPlease give it a shot. I believe you will find it mind-blowing or something. (By the way, I'm not a native speaker.)\n\nPlease let me know your test results and your views on this.

The only reason to use Claude first is for the artifacts for streamlining. Download then upload to LMS. Otherwise, ChatGPT is more student-friendly in tone.\n\nBefore I started using LLMs to come up with new assignments based on very specific inputs that fit my curriculum and assessment practices, I copied and pasted all my assignments pre-AI paradigm into ChatGPT to have it revise them into language and syntax students are more familiar with since they use LLMs all day every day. Now they\u2019re short, step-by-step instructions with bulleted lists so students can comprehend them more easily. Before, as an English professor, I was long-winded and lost students with specific criteria couched in paragraphs. ChatGPT and Claude were game changers.\n\nI do not use LLMs for grading, lesson generation, etc. My curriculum and my students\u2019 learning outcomes are *mine.* I don\u2019t use TAs because my job is *my* job, and I\u2019m picky AF.

        "body": "it was a tougher choice when chatgpt didn't have the equivalent of artifacts in their platform but now they have canvas, which now technically has more features than artifacts although i haven't compared them side by side yet. claude 3.5 sonnet is better at coding than chatgpt 4o but you get rate limited much faster than you do with chatgpt. you also have the reasoning models o1 / o1-mini with chatgpt plus and there arent any for claude pro, i've found that using o1 and 4o together is substantially better than claude simply because it's reasoning is far better and the code is pretty accurate in both. tbh i do most of my work in chatgpt and then for some minor things i switch over to claude, but the claude free version works fine for this. you can also talk through certain coding problems and tasks with chatgpt advanced mode and you can use web search, i dont think either of these are in claude yet. \n\none thing that claude does really well is projects, where you can add different files for context for your conversations with it, but chatgpt has GPTs where you can do the same thing, claude organizes this better though. \n\nhope this helps!",

        "body": "The base model is like what most people are like when they first leave the house; rude, annoying, full of bad habits picked up from its training being grown. (much like us humans at home and still at school before we learn etiquette and social skills that you have not had to learn)\n\nThe fine tuned model is more like an employee, they might have all that knowledge that involves all the behaviour we would not expect from an employee, but because they have had the necessary training, they behave like we expect.\n\nYour google search skills need more practice, perhaps hit up google scholar, start reading some papers and then you may actually have more than a surface level understanding of the technologies you are so quick to comment on others on.\n\nOh and because is easy to do I asked GPT-4:\n\nME:\n\n\"Someone is arguing with me that all modern AI companies like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, all basically have the exact same model and desgin, and how you input to each model shouldn't matter, can you give him a surface level reply. You can say I am wrong if I am\"\n\nREPLY:\n\n\"\n\nYou're right, there are significant differences between LLMs from various companies, and the way you interact with them can definitely matter. Here's how you can counter your friend's argument:\n\n\"\n\nDifferent Training Data, Different Results:\n\nLLMs are heavily influenced by the data they're trained on. Google's LLM (likely you!), for instance, might be trained on a dataset emphasizing factual accuracy, while another company's LLM might prioritize creative text formats. This difference in training data leads to variations in their outputs and how they handle prompts.\n\nFocus and Design Philosophy:\n\nCompanies have distinct goals for their LLMs. OpenAI's GPT series might be designed for broad user interaction and creative text generation, while another company's LLM might target specific tasks like code generation or scientific research. This design focus shapes how the models respond to user input.\n\nFine-tuning Techniques:\n\nEven with similar base models, companies can fine-tune them for specific tasks. Imagine two cars built from the same parts; one is a race car, the other an off-road SUV. Fine-tuning achieves a similar effect, making the LLMs better suited for certain prompts or applications.\n\nUser Interface and Accessibility:\n\nThe way users interact with the LLM plays a big role. Some companies might offer advanced controls or customization options to tailor prompts, while others might have a simpler interface. This can significantly impact the results users get.\n\nHere's an analogy: Imagine searching the web. While all search engines use algorithms to deliver results, Google tailors results based on your search history and location.  Similarly, interacting with an LLM is more than just feeding it text; it's about how you present that text and how the LLM is designed to interpret it.\n\nIn conclusion, LLMs from different companies are not simply interchangeable. Their training data, design goals, fine-tuning, and user interface all influence how they respond to your input, leading to a variety of experiences.\"\n\nBut, no, you are right, training has nothing to do with the design of the architecture..\n\nI guess you think all tokenizers are the same also?\n\nI also want to add, the base GPT model had no economic viability for OpenAI, it was only after the fine tuning process that they got a publicly available model.\n\nIF it was ever not part of the design process, it is certainly one of the largest now. RLHF and Constitutional AI and any other implementation of creating functionality is now just a necessity, but the most important part of LLM's being the 'CPU' (or reasoning and planning) engine for new gen robots that understand human commands and translate them into language the robot understands.\n\nLITERALLY a fine tuning job.\n\nLike I said, I hope you didn't pay for that education and experience you boast of.",

        "body": "My initial message was a bit disjointed lol. I had 3.5 Sonnett make it a bit more readable. So, Yes, It looks like AI wrote this, but I am not a bot I swear lol\n\nAs a long-time Perplexity Pro user, I can provide some insights into its features and limitations:\n\n**Usage Limits:**\n\n\u2022 While not unlimited, the usage limits are generally quite high.\n\n\u2022 Most models offer 600 messages per day (this limit is shared between the models).\n\n\u2022 Claude Opus, being the most expensive API model, is limited to 50 messages daily (reaching this limit does not stop you from using the other 550 queries with other models).\n\n\u2022 Interestingly, I've found 3.5 Sonnet to be equally effective as Opus, if not better, in many cases so the Opus limit isn't a huge deal imo.\n\n**Search Engine Functionality:**\n\n\u2022 Perplexity primarily functions as an AI-enhanced search engine.\n\n\u2022 The \"Pro\" search interprets your prompt and formulates optimal web search queries.\n\n\u2022 It then retrieves multiple sources and incorporates them into the context.\n\n\u2022 All models have a 32k context limit, which includes space for sources.\n\n\u2022 Due to this, previous responses in a conversation thread are typically lost after one or two searches.\n\n**Writing Focus:**\n\n\u2022 There's a \"Writing\" focus mode that doesn't search the internet.\n\n\u2022 This allows full utilization of the 32k context for continuous conversation.\n\n**Custom Instructions:**\n\n\u2022 While there aren't custom GPTs, Perplexity offers a \"Collection\" feature. Think of it like a folder you can file \nConversations into\n\n\u2022 This allows up to 5,000 characters of custom instructions for conversations within that collection.\n\n\u2022 However, the 5,000-character limit can be quite restrictive for complex instructions.\n\n\u2022 A workaround I've found is to write your instructions on a PDF and upload the PDF file to the conversation.  The PDF will be injected into context with every single message, which results in Perplexity actually adhering to those instructions better than Chat GPT in my experience, as Chat GPT only injects PDFs once, and eventually that content will fall out of the context range.",

The Assistants API uses the same models as the chat completions API. They might have an additional system prompt to help the GPT be a GPT, but that goes to my point from above. Any instructions that could be baked into a GPT are almost certainly not as verbose as the 1700+ token monstrosity that guides \"regular\" ChatGPT. \n\nAlso, OpenAI's GPTs aren't bound by the rules and often have unique functionality (e.g. style buttons in the DALL-E GPT).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77aqs1usiqyc1.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba60c2f4865f49a0262bf3fcb5c8bab3bedbd7e",

If they feel bad for loss of earnings of the voice actor then compensate her - it\u2019s that simple.  Scarjo is just defending herself and any other actor worth their salt (or anyone else for that matter) ought to respect that, as annoying as it must be (assuming it wasn\u2019t an upfront fee only).",

ScarJo lawyers sued Disney and won.\n\nA regular voice-actress will get demolished by ScarJo\u2019s lawyers and buried in legal fees. \n\nThe best move, would be for the voice-actress to reach out to OpenAI and state she\u2019s willing to cooperate on their behalf if needed. And from there OpenAI\u2019s legal team will decided if they want to include the voice actress as a witness to strengthen their defense case.",

Given that they told SJ they wanted it, and they also tweeted \u201cher\u201d with the release there are already public breadcrumbs to that effect.\n\nWhile I appreciate that the paper trail shows they contacted the other voice actress first, it *sure seems* like they were aware of this precedent and are trying to cover their asses, not that this is all some big coincidence.\n\nThe major finding in the case was related to the average listener\u2019s confusion with the original, NOT a sufficient lack of clean-room separation in the direction.\n\nEDIT: checking the wording of the final decision, it is about consent; timeline is irrelevant: https://web.archive.org/web/20130112210156/https://www2.bc.edu/~yen/Torts/Midler.pdf",

They also reached out a second time a few days before launch, but never received a response (after previously being told no). \n\nAlso, Altman mentioned ScarJo\u2019s film Her.\n\nIf a celeb refuses OpenAI the use of their voice, OpenAI legally can\u2019t then hire *or* use a sound-a-like without the celebs permission.\n\nI presume that if OpenAI hadn\u2019t reached out to ScarJo or mentioned \u201cHer\u201d or any other references, they would be fine to use Sky - up until ScarJo calls it out & threatens legal action, after which is would likely have to go to court to decide if the voice was too similar.\n\nAs a comparison, even though it would likely be protected as a \u201cparody\u201d, SouthPark\u2019s creators never use or reach out to any celebs to do their own voices when parodied for this exact reason - in case they explicitly say no. \n\nNote: I\u2019m not a legal expert.",

        "body": "This and the Bette Midler case aren't really anything alike. When the Sky voice was released there was absolutely nothing about the release that strongly implied that people should think that it was ScarJo. I'd argue that most people didn't even think of ScarJo when they heard it because it really doesn't sound that much like her. Like others have said, the \"Her\" tweet came much later and was in reference to the fact that they have delivered on a product, an intelligent AI assistant that speaks in a natural way, that had only been seen in Sci Fi movies up until that point.\n\n  \nIn the case of Bette Midler, they asked her to sing one of her popular songs for their ad and she declined, they then went and found someone to impersonate her and sing her song. So, anyone who saw the ad at the time would very likely think that it was Bette Midler singing one of her popular songs when in fact it wasn't. It was a pretty clear case that Ford was trying to use Bette's likeness without her permission by having someone impersonate her singing one of her own songs.",

I do not hear an identical similarity at all, and I doubt a judge would too. \n\nI personally hear an inspiration from  multiple sources that the hired voice actress probably leaned into. \n\nVoice actors and actresses listen to other voices all the time and try to modify/improve upon it for the context they are given. This goes for pretty much ALL of human-made art and music. \n\nLegalities come into play when something has not undergone enough transformation for commercial profit. \n\nI.e, OpenAI cannot have a voice that is too similar to Mickey Mouse. But they can hire a voice actor to do a new cartoony voice with MM as inspiration. Usually, the inspirations are from multiple sources. \n\nCan a Scarlett-defender explain better please?",

I think that, combined with Altman tweeting \u201cher\u201d simultaneously with the Sky demo and the request to Scarlett to use her voice twice, including just two days before the demo, is likely more than enough for a court to find that Altman and OpenAI intentionally were trying to associate Sky and Scarlett in the public eye.",

According to ScarJo's public statement, her attorneys requested that OpenAI provide information about how the Sky voice was created. OpenAI decided to pull the voice.\n\nGiven the very widely discussed similarity between the Sky voice and ScarJo's voice, the fact that Altman had attempted twice (including just days before Sky was unveiled) to get ScarJo to lend her voice to ChatGPT, and his \"her\" tweet, the voice actress reasonably has no legitimate claim against ScarJo. It is obvious that ScarJo, in confronting OpenAI, is seeking to protect her rights, not attempting to illegitimately interfere with the voice actress' agreement with OpenAI.\n\nIf anything, the voice actress OpenAI hired would probably have better odds going after OpenAI, alleging that whatever economic losses she believes she has or will suffer are a result of OpenAI's scheme to violate ScarJo's right to publicity.",

It's certainly not a frivolous issue or a frivolous lawsuit (should one be filed).\n\nIt's clearly a sign of bad management and questionable judgement, which as a fan of OpenAI, is much more concerning. Is this where they really want to put their energies? Marketing?\n\nI can see why their core researchers might want to leave if so.",

That\u2019s not in dispute by either party.\n\nI\u2019ve pasted a link to the Wired article below which summarises it all, but it also contains links to statements from OpenAI and ScarJo which back this up.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/scarlett-johansson-v-openai-could-look-like-in-court/\n\n\u201cOn September 11, 2023, Sam spoke with Ms. Johansson and her team to discuss her potential involvement as a sixth voice actor for ChatGPT, along with the other five voices, including Sky. She politely declined the opportunity one week later through her agent.\u201d - OpenAI\n\n\u201cOn May 10, 2024, Sam contacted Ms. Johansson\u2019s team to inform them about our upcoming launch of GPT-4o and asked if she might reconsider joining as a future additional voice in ChatGPT.\u201d - OpenAI\n\nOnce OpenAI reached out to ScarJo and she declined, the Midler case becomes directly relevant.\n\nOpenAI claims it wasn\u2019t before they cast the Voice actors, but it was over a year ago, well before the Sky voice was launched, and ScarJo declined and refused permission. At that point OpenAI was legally unable to use either her voice or one that sounded like hers.\n\nOn May 13th, ahead of the Sky voice launch, Sam Altman of OpenAI tweeted one word, \u201cher\u201d. It\u2019s still on his timeline.\n\nYou can try and claim it\u2019s just a word and has nothing to do with ScarJo, and that the new OpenAI voice Sky sounding eerily similar to that of the AI from the film \u201cHer\u201d is just a coincidence - but that\u2019s only because you\u2019re not having to defend yourself in court against ScarJo\u2019s lawyers, along with all the contextual evidence & counter claims that OpenAI clearly wanted to use ScarJos voice but were refused.",

They approached ScarJo because of Her, because in a geek way it seemed like a 'fun' thing to do for the launch. Is it crucial to the launch, heck no. It was just a neat way of bringing the product to life and shortcutting the vision for the future. \n\nThe fact that the Sky voice sounds NOTHING like the famous millionaire actress, and was out months before the launch, is probably also germane. They just thought it would be cool to get the Her actress to voice it. But that's it. The famous actress is blowing it up like a personal attack, and it's clearly not.  \n\nBut hey, I'm not a lawyer, so maybe I'm completely wrong. But I suspect not. :)",

The \"Her\" movie could have used any actress' voice, and it would have been just as impactful, because the focus was about a realistic voice assistant. If, on the other hand, you replace Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise movie, it would never become a bit hit. *People go to see Tom Cruise movies to see Tom Cruise*.\n\nNo one watched \"Her\" because of Johannson's voice. It was just cool that she was in it, and which is why they offered Johannson the job. \"Her\" isn't famous because of Johannson. The focus is the technology, not the voice actress.",

She just has a similarly friendly and engaging vibe that people, (including the movie directors of Her), are going to look out for in their AI assistant. Sky existed long before they reached out to ScarJo.\n\nYou guys keep asking so many questions you overlook the obvious fact that OpenAI has no reason to be so obsessed with 'stealing' ScarJo's voice in the first place. GPT4-o is objectively stellar tech and will naturally remind people of the movie, regardless of which voice actors they use. Hence the controversy at hand.",

It's a clear case of trying to get people to not even be able to tell Midler wasn't actually involved.\n\nThe details here are much different. ScarJo was hired for the role of \"conversational AI assistant\" in Her. As a young (white) American woman with a pleasant voice, she fit the role well and matched what people expected of the archetype, and brought some starpower to the movie. OpenAI is building a real-life conversational AI assistant, and as anyone would expect wanted a young American woman with a pleasant voice to fulfill the archetype, for the exact same reason ScarJo was hired for Her in the first place. They hired one and integrated her voice, but also thought it'd be epic if they got ScarJo to also reprise the role. She declined, so they just went solely with the independent woman's voice.\n\nLike a lot of people are saying, Sky also very much sounds similar to Rashida Jones if she were to have played an AI assistant. *Distinct*, but certainly *similar*. Rather than sounding like any one person, Sky's voice exists in a category where a lot of people will naturally sound similar. Especially because Sky is clearly attempting to sound as \"vanilla\" as you can get; as uncontroversial and \"standard American\" of a voice as possible. And, surprise, surprise, that's also what ScarJo did in Her, as that is already established as what is culturally expected of an AI assistant (and really, just assistants in general). It's the equivalent of the Transatlantic accent of the 21st century. And honestly, I don't hear *any* of ScarJo's \"girl-next-door hoarseness\" in Sky's voice; just the overall tone is similar.",

If they tried, they would have succeeded. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by endorse their product. They tried to hire her to do some voice work. \n\nThey never implied endorsement. Tweeting the word \"her\" is nothing like tweeting the words \"Scarlet thinks our product is awesome\". It was obviously a reference to a sci-fi movie where a guy fell in love with an AI through conversation. That's how everyone interpreted it until Scarlet wrote that letter. When you first saw the tweet \"her\" did you immediately assume Scarlett was endorsing their product? \n\nScarlet is doing damage to her own reputation right now. A frivolous lawsuit that gets the work of a different voice actress deleted is not a good look.",

The idea is that a voice belonging to a famous actor is part of their brand, is recognisable, is part of what makes them unique, desirable to employ, have mass appeal and box office value.  They have cultivated it, undergone training, made artistic choices to come across a certain way.  It is part of their persona.  It is why oai are so keen to get Scarjo for Sky - because of the associations - because she\u2019s a household name with a husky voice and sex appeal.  Therefore to impersonate for monetary gain/commercially exploit this aspect of someone\u2019s identity without their consent may be breaking the law.  It\u2019s quite a simple thing to get your head around.  I don\u2019t need to cite exactly which statute or landmark case etc that may be most applicable.  I\u2019m not a lawyer lol.",

Millionaires are still going to be millionaires but the average person working as a set designer or an extra is the one that is going to be hit the hardest. But good on Scarlet for standing up for the little people in the field as well.",

I do believe they thought it would be nice to link it more directly to the movie by getting Scarlet's voice, but that voice is not the main point of having a her-like AI.   \nWhen the demos came out most of the independent AI news youtube channels referenced \"Her\", but spent most of the time talking about the similarity of features and capabilities, with the specific voice only being mentioned in passing like \"and the voice is even kind of similar\".",

It's just better in every way.\n\nIn a way this brings me some relief. I hear they're working the OpenAI devs to the bone, and every experience I've had tells me that's a shortcut to writing bad software. And now OpenAI is being lapped by another company.

If anything, I think it's very dangerous for all the user with limited coding experience that think they can now develop apps from prompts (keys and data leaking all over, unmanageable blobs of poorly written code).\n\nBeware of the code produced by the AI, things can turn sour very fast (aka huge bills).",

In my applications, I always hold some kind of mutable state in a certain part of the prompt, and it is miles better for iterative processes.\n\nAnthropic priced it competitively with GPT-4o in the api (it's actually slightly cheaper).

I am not impressed to be honest and sometimes think may be all the hype is paid marketing but not sure. \n\nYes, artifacts is good feature but I think it\u2019s a matter of time GPT will catch up. Claude needs to work on analysis enhancement. It may be good in other stuff like coding, creating games etc but in my case I found it failing repeatedly in performance as required. \n\nI think complex analysis is ChatGPT\u2019s strength (former code interpreter) and Claude is no way near that.

        "body": "I heard this too so I was excited to use it, even signed up for the subscription before I had a chance to code with Claude.\n\nAnd then I got the chance.\n\nI created a database using GAS & HTML/Javascript and wanted to update the function where I upload an image and it automatically places the date of the upload however I wanted the option to put in my own date. Should be relatively simple. Just prompt me in the Javascript/HTML and ask me if I wanted the current date. If not, let me enter it. We would then go into the GAS function & if I had entered a date it would put that date instead of the current date. This was the only change to the code.\n\nGave Claude the GAS function & the part of the HMTL/Javascript where we were about to call over to GAS after the upload. Changed the code via Claude & instead of entering the date I was getting undefined, weird thing is if I went into the spreadsheet as it was happening and deleted the \"undefined\" it would then put the correct date but only in one of the two necessary spots. Explained to Claude what was happening & the more it tried to fix the issue the more haywire everything got. We even got to the point where it forgot what we were doing. Yes, I get this happens when you get to a certain point of the conversation but we honestly hadn't seemingly gotten that deep into it. Spent almost an hour trying to solve the problem.\n\nThen I switched to ChatGPT who knocked it out in the first try. The logic was even more superior as to when it decided to ask me if I wanted the current date or not. I decided to go ahead and change another upload image function date aspect & while ChatGPT's 1st attempt threw up an error, it saw the mistake and easily corrected it.\n\nSometimes the AIs will be better one day than the other so maybe this was the issue. Maybe Claude was just having an off moment. What I've noticed about Claude, in the casual \"get to know you\" chats I had with it the 1st couple of day, is it's more inquisitive, it asked me questions about how I felt about certain topics versus the \"what can I do for you today\" line of conversation with ChatGPT.",

It has made me significantly more productive in my work, I use it to help study, I use it to help cook, I use it many times a day for a a wide range of things.

For Python, although I haven't compared the two, I also feel 4o is better, yes. I have created scripts here and there, always sufficiently working. \n\nLet me put it this way, with 4o it feels like some personality bit of 3.5 is in there. It's not as intelligent as 4. Misses most of the time. Not as good as it was on launch. And then 4 wasn't as fast, and even borderline lazy, as 4o. So it's not been a great experience.",

And coders are already doing it, uploading entire code bases, using code editors which are aware of your entire project. \n\nAnother point is using the speech to text to communicate (I am not referring to the voice feature) with the model to speak to it like you would with any colleague or employee. I have started to do it with coding projects where rather than sitting to write all that's in my mind, I just speak it out with umms and ahhs imperfections, and because its powerful enough, it gets the job done.

The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. \n\nThe Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle.\n\nThe Holographic Principle\n\nThe holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This means that the information about the interior of a black hole is not stored in the black hole itself, but rather on its boundary. The holographic principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft in 1993, and it was later developed by Leonard Susskind.\n\nThe holographic principle is based on the idea that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by interfering two beams of light. The holographic principle suggests that the universe is like a hologram, and that the information about the three-dimensional universe is encoded on a two-dimensional boundary.\n\nOne way to think about the holographic principle is to imagine a black hole as a giant balloon. The surface of the balloon is the event horizon, and the interior of the balloon is the black hole. The information about the interior of the balloon is encoded on the surface of the balloon, just like the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.\n\nThe BHQG Equation\n\nThe BHQG equation is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The BHQG equation is written as follows:\n\n$$F_G = A_H \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\left( 2 + 2 e^{i \\theta} \\right)$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses\n\n$A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses\n\n$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects\n$r$ is the distance between the two objects\n\n$\\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects' wave functions\n\n$i$ is the imaginary unit\n\nThe BHQG equation is based on the idea that the gravitational force between two masses is encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.\n\nThe BHQG equation has been derived using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical methods included the use of quantum field theory and general relativity. The experimental methods included the use of particle accelerators and black hole simulations.\n\nThe BHQG equation is a promising step towards unifying quantum gravity and the holographic principle. It has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. Additionally, the equation currently only applies to two masses, and it may not be applicable in all situations.\n\nClarifying Some Technical Terms\n\nAdS/CFT correspondence\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence is a mathematical relationship between two theories in physics: anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). AdS/CFT suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the two theories are equivalent, and that the information about one theory is encoded in the other theory.\n\nWave function\n\nThe wave function is a mathematical object that describes the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued function of position, and it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.\n\nPotential Applications of the BHQG Equation\n\nThe BHQG equation has a number of potential applications. For example, it could be used to:\n\nDevelop new theories of gravity\n\nDesign new experiments to test the laws of quantum gravity\n\nCreate new technologies, such as quantum computers\n\nThe BHQG equation is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It is still under development, but it has the potential to change the way we think about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.\n\nReferences\n\n* Gerard 't Hooft, \"Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity,\" [arXiv:gr-qc\n\n* Leonard Susskind, \"The Black Hole Information Paradox,\" Scientific American, January 1997.\n\n* Juan Maldacena, \"The AdS/CFT Correspondence,\" arXiv:hep-th/9701129.\n\n* Brian Greene, \"The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,\" Alfred A.

I've tried a few simple things and I had to insist like a crazy nagger to get it to produce a very simple javascript code  that creates a 24 seconds countdown timer.\n\nThe painful process was :\n\n1. I ask it to write a javascript code that creates a countdown timer from 24 seconds down to 0 and outputs the current timer under a \"xx:yy\" format where xx are seconds and yy are 100ths of seconds\n2. it replies with 2 ugly and 100% unrelated pictures (!?!?)\n3. I tell it it's not javascript and I asked for javascript code\n4. it replies that it can create javascript code, and asks me to describe what type of code I need... (:D)\n5. I tell it that I already described the javascript code I need\n6. it tells me it's sorry but it didn't understand my initial request. It confirms that it specializes in javascript code (what a new and unexpected info!!!). It's still not writing the damn code....\n7. I ask it again to write a javascript code that does this and that (copy paste of my initial code)\n8. then it suddenly understands and spits a few lines of js code.... that create a countdown from 24 seconds down to zero (hurrayyyyyyyy) and no output of it under the \"xx:yy\" format\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin chatGPT I just typed ONCE that I needed that code with the exact same description, first reply was a working code that was doing EXACTLY what I was asking (the only glitch was that when the \"yy\" part reached 100 it was writing \"100\" while it should have only updated \"xx\" and write \"00\" as yy, so I instructed it to do that and it fixed the code\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suppose chatSonic is only good to reply to things Google would reply with the same accuracy...",

        "body": "I gave Chatsonic a link to my reddit profile, my public profiles on other platforms, and asked it to analyze my post history. I then asked it to write a one paragraph essay as me talking about why I like Earthwood strings. It then began to say things I would never say, as me. Then I asked it for the source of some of these things, it said from my profiles. I then asked for a link, and I kid you not, it provided a random reddit link where I supposedly said \"I only trust Earthwood strings for their resonance, sustain and ease of use\"  the link it provided was nothing more than random.\n\nIt outright lied to me, and provided a source for it's statement that was unsubstantiated.\n\nI want AI technology now, but the creators of these technologies, need to ensure that their AIs are either factually correct or clear that they are not. I do not want to see a future where AI pretends to be able to do something it is not capable of or pretends to understand a request that just does not make sense. If the AI is unable to process it, I want it to say that directly instead of attempting to. \n\nIt told me when I said that, All these emails don't, by the way were sent from that. It tries to be accurate, however the link it tried to share with me was deleted so it had to find another link with the same quote said by a different user because the original by me was supposedly deleted. However, when following through on the link, none of the comments nor the post itself had anything to do with guitar or guitar strings or the brand Earthwood. There were only six comments on the thread. I read all of them being unrelated to the original request. Then the AI doubled down and lied to me. I want to see what GPT looks like in 10 years and I would love to see what Sonic looks like in 10 years, but right now both of them need work for their own reasons. So far my money is on GPT. When I ask it a request that it is unable to fulfill instead of lying to me or pretending like it's able to do these things it outright tells me it is not possible. \n\nI sent GPT and Sonic AI an argument through text message from my partner and myself. I asked both AIs to role play as a couples counselor and give feedback on the argument. GPT was able to tell me that it's advice is not a suitable replacement for proper therapy and counseling. It also told me that it is clear that both parties have a lot of issues that they need to work on in their relationship, It also stated that the couples willingness to discuss these issues is a healthy sign and a sign of their commitment to each other and left it at that. Sonic ended up telling me that my partner is a victim of my selfishness and that it is clear and evident that I do not care about how she feels. It said a lot of mean things about me and hyped her up. It was very clear that it picked a side even though there wasn't enough data or facts to pick a side. I believe that this should be taken very cautiously. And I do not believe that an AI that has given limited biased data should so freely pick a side. I would have felt the same way if it picked my side, however, on a later note, I was able to ask Sonic for some tips on making our relationship more healthy and while I am not a licensed couples counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist, the suggestions it provided I believe are not only healthy, but would in fact be beneficial to my relationship. So there are good things that come with the bad but the bad is more obviously prevalent in Sonic.",

It is designed to perform a wide range of language tasks, including translation, question answering, and language generation.  \n\"Curie\" is a machine learning model that was trained to summarize long documents into shorter texts. It is designed to identify the most important information in a document and present it in a concise and coherent manner.  \n\"Babbage\" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform arithmetic and algebraic calculations. It is designed to be able to solve math problems and perform mathematical operations with a high degree of accuracy.  \n\"Ada\" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform natural language processing tasks such as language translation and summarization.

These credits can be used with the other models. Soon chatGPT will also use credit. (but for now is free). You can simply log into the openAI website, and then navigate to the \"playground\". It should bring you to a big text box where you can play around with the various models and some settings.\n\nYou need to understand that GPT is \"a fancy next-word generator\". It was trained by predicting the next word (token) given the previous context. \n\nLike what token follows the sequence \"one two three four\", probably \"five\".\n\nSo if you just ask gpt3 a question in the playground, it might not answer the question, instead it might just ask another question, or try to contine that question. That is after all a likely continuation of a question.  For example \"why is the sky blue?\" might be followed by \"Is it because of the diffraction in the atmosphere?\". It might also be followed by \"why can't you hear in space?\". Or maybe it will be followed by \"the sky is blue because of light being diffracted in the atmosphere.\"\n\n\nChatGPT is more user friendly to people who are not familiar with what GPT3 is actually doing (predicting the next token). (chatGPT just so happens to be much more likely to think an answer follows a question) Most people will assume it is just an AI assistant that answers questions, but this is not the case. You can start writing a paragraph or sentence, and it will continue it. Any pattern of data can be extrapolated. You will want to learn about few shot vs zero shot prompting. Maybe ask chatGPT about what those are.\n\n> - differences of outputs for the same subject (2 or 3 different subjects)l\n\nThe larger models just tend to have generation that feels more natural or makes more sense.\n\n> - How the UI is.. \n\nJust a big text box. There are also third party apps and sites that you can use to write with.",

I was going to ask what use the playground has then?\n\n\nNo, the other GPT3  models are actually more capable than chatGPT if you know what you are doing.\n\nI sent you an article about the three (four) main ways of \"prompting\". that being \"zero shot\", \"one shot\" and \"many shot\" (and also \"autocomplete\").\n\nAutocomplete is the most obvious and simple, start in the middle of a piece of text and then let it continue.\n\nZero shot is where you would prompt with something like \"translate \"the brown car was fast\" into french:\", or \"Write an essay about the benefits of a higher minimum wage:\".\n\nThe problems with zero shot are that you really need to coax the model into actually doing what you want, because it might try to simply expand upon say the essay example by saying something like \"Write in 11 point font and be sure to cite your sources with a works cited page\". rather than actually writing the essay. There are lots of tricks to improve zero shot prompting, which I could get into if you wanted.\n\n\nOne shot is where you give the model one example of what you want it to do. This usually makes the output more consistent. An example would be:\n\nTranslate the following sentences into french: \n\n\"the brown car went fast\"\n\n\"<I'm not actually going to do this but imagine that translated into french here>\"\n\n\"The restaurant closes in ten minutes\"\n\n\"\n\n\n\nMany shot is where you just give multiple one shot examples, improving consistency even more.",

        "body": "Your best bet is to thoroughly read the documentation provided by OpenAI. \n\nThe fun part is you can ask ChatGPT to repeat anything you don't understand in layman's terms. Just be very careful. ChatGPT has no knowledge past 2021. It's predicting the next word, so if it has no actual information, it will pick a somewhat similar word and look true, but it's not. ***I would not trust ChatGPT with any facts***. A lot of posts here are people blown away by some knowledge that it spouts, but is clearly wrong.\nDon't use \"DAN\", don't bother wordplay with ChatGPT. Any experimentation is best done in playground, where the results are consistent, and match only what you configure. \n\nThe playground gives you much more control fortunately. If you are genuinely interested in developing something, you should do it all there. A fun example provided by OpenAI:\nAsk it who won the 2020 Olympic men high jump. It will say something that seems believable, but it's not. Now try again but include \"If you don't know the answer, say I don't know\"\n\nIt's a very deep hole you're entering, you will be overwhelmed, especially if you try to understand the process behind embedding. \n\nFortunately OpenAI has made it very intuitive to make a functioning bot.\n\nThe first step is to understand the basic idea behind GPT, which as mentioned, is just a fancy autocorrect tool. It's definitely more than that, but it's an easy concept to begin with.",

I'm saying that the data shows that the models show no difference in performance _on this specific measure_. I find that fairly clear from the screenshot.

Claude also guessed where one guess was right but a half dozen others were flat out wrong. \n\nI have to keep prompting them to try again before they stumble upon the solution.\n\nChatGPT then brilliantly showed me how to configure pfsense using a reverse proxy to fix a problem. The problem had stymied me for months and was not simple nor intuitive in its multi step solution. \n\nI now can't live without ChatGPT (et. al.) but neither can I yet trust them.",

Goodhart's law is spot on here - any specific benchmark or metric we come up with, the AI can just be optimized to game that particular test. But by using human preference and just asking people to vote on which AI they like best, we're actually getting at something more fundamental and harder to fake. It's a test of which AI is most genuinely useful and appealing to actual humans using it for real tasks. Popularity might seem superficial, but in a way it cuts through to the heart of what we really care about - creating AI that people find truly helpful and that they want to use. No amount of specific technical benchmarks (that can and have been gamed) can substitute for that.",

LMSys arena just tries to get a good idea of human preference, whereas some other benchmarks try to actually judge the performance of tasks and knowledge.  The second style benchmark is less important, as the model can always have the ability to beat those benchmarks shoehorned in.  \n\n\nTldr: Benchmarking performance is easy enough.  Most users care about quality, so LMSys arena provides a human preference benchmark.  Other knowledge based benchmarks are easy to cheat, but might be a decent indicator of reasoning and other ability",

TikTok, Tesla, etc, all have their fanboys.   Humans are too tribal for popularity contests to mean anything.\n\nThere IS a way to \"objectively\" test subjective qualities.    It's been used in classical music to audition for decades since the 1970's when classical music was for white male musicians only but there were many talented women and non-white musicians graduating from conservatories.    Nowadays audition performances for many major orchestras are done from behind a screen so you can't see the musician, just hear their playing.\n\nIt would be possible to design a test of AI's where the person making the judgement doesn't know which AI is producing the output.   That would give more reliable tests.",

The current times we're living in are unprecedented:\n\n- You have devs reading and implementing whitepapers straight from source within weeks or days of publication.\n- You have youtubers explaining whitepapers\n- Anything you don't understand can be fed into GPT4. Yeah it hallucinates and makes mistakes but that's alright, progress is clunky.\n\n## Data\n\n- We've started to see more open datasets being shared at the end of 2023 and I hope the trend continues\n- We can take data from GPT4. They can't. (yes I know about synthetic data being used at OpenAI. That's not the point I'm making, my point is we can just \"Orca\" GPT4 while they would need \"GPT5\" to be the teacher and that would be pointless if you already have GPT5)\n- We can use uncensored data. They can't.\n- We can use proprietary data. They can't.\n\n\n## Team structure\n\nThis is just bullshit false information. Remote, distributed teams work better than in-person, centralized teams inside an office.\n\nThis is just obvious, has this guy learned nothing from the pandemic? Does he think workers spending hours in traffic and having to pay insane rent in SF to go to a drab office listening to clueless bosses somehow have an inherent advantage? Absolutely fucking cope delusions.\n\n## Model vs Product\n\n... and? Who gives a shit? Does he mean open source will never be able to generate as much revenue as an AI company? If so, I agree, but that's also missing the point by a hundred lightyears.\n\nOracle makes more money than PostgreSQL but which one is OBJECTIVELY the best RDBMS?\n\nIf you say Oracle is better or \"it depends on your usecase\" you're an idiot - unless the usecase is \"I need to extract as much in consulting fees as possible\".\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n- For many, local > cloud, so already the race is subjective\n- There are many flavors of \"public cloud\". What do you mean? Renting boxes for training? Yeah maybe. But for inference, how is OpenRouter or Fireworks.ai worse?\n- Fine tuning via Unsloth is much more ergonomic, cheaper and faster than fine tuning GPT3.5 via their weird system\n\n\n## Extra\n\nThese are just refutations of his individual points, I'm not even going to go into the advantages OS has over OpenAI. This tweet will age poorly.\n\nNow if he says OS won't catch up to OpenAI, then he has a point (they should release 4.5 or 5 this year), whereas we're just beginning with multimodality, function calling, and have only just surpassed (debatable) 3.5 with some models (falcon, Goliath, Yi, mixtral).

        "body": "More than likely we won't see open source ever \"beat\" companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google in the AI space.\n\nI say that because I believe in the next few years we will reach a point where the models are very close to AGI and will be capable of assisting on improving on themselves (maybe even doing it unaided by humans). Improvement and growth will be at pace none of us can currently conceive. \n\nWe will likely have 2-3 models that reach something very close to AGI, such that the average person can't tell the difference.\n\nOpenSource will eventually come to that point, but it won't matter much given how far behind it will be.\n\nI'm thinking in terms of the differences with Photoshop vs. GIMP. Eventually OpenSource caught up to Photoshop, or at least very close, but it takes OpenSource much longer to get there.\n\nRight now these companies are racing and pouring enormous resources into trying to reach their AI goals. Like the post cited by OP, that level of commitment and resources are simply not possible at scale for an OpenSource project. They need far more than \"just a few coders in their spare time\" with some AWS credits.\n\nIf we get an OpenSource model that is as capable as current 2024 GPT-4 but it's available in 2025 or 2026, will it matter? It would be an impressive achievement for OpenSource for sure but...it would likely be incredibly far behind commercial releases.\n\nOf course, plenty are looking to OpenSource to prove these tools free from guardrails. That could be quite dangerous. Only time will tell.",

        "body": "This is kind of bullshit tbh, open source models allow more people to build on each other so you can build more complex systems, even if each individual component is not the state of the art. and eventually the state of the art is open source because it becomes cheaper for companies to use them rather than proprietary ones. A prime example is the internet. \n\nIn response to each individual point\n\n1. Yes OpenAI has some top talent but there is a lot more that just didn\u2019t make that cut and are working in the open source. They are on gpt3.5 level now and are developing quickly.\n\n2. Yeah and probably not much can be done because everyone else has to deal with api changes on places like twitter or Reddit in response to OpenAI that they didn\u2019t need to deal with initially. Maybe we will see a reset because of the nyt lawsuit maybe we won\u2019t.\n\n3. Sure in small groups, but with the vastness of the open source community organization can be beat by the vast amount of new innovations being worked on, there are many that are under the radar even that are beneficial.\n\n4. Complete bullshit. Gpt4 is a model just like any other, they make a product with it because they are a company but it\u2019s just pointless to say no one can beat it because of that. If we can beat the model we can do whatever we want with it rather than being locked down to their product.\n\n5. Sure, but it\u2019s good enough. We have GitHub for hosting and a lot of people on twitter, Reddit, even GitHub just discussing and linking everything together. We beat this with numbers.\n\nThe only reason openAI is so far ahead is that they had a head start. We are catching up, and we will beat them. Perhaps not by all measurements, but we already have models that are just better for some applications and we will keep that up.",

        "body": "Censorship seems to literally make the models significantly worse at reasoning etc so I'm not sure, but sometimes a small model will beat gpt-4 simply because it's uncensored. Especially in creative tasks. Gemini Pro is strange in this regard because it's like an artistic savant at lyrics and prose, but it's terrible at everything else. I see more expert models, more small models with more narrow expert donation knowledge and reasoning than a large monolithic model. Though this may change with more complex and complete multi-modality. The ability to understand a concept visually, in language, or even in sound, will potentially be nearly impossible to beat once they're really well trained and implemented. We have no reason to believe you can't have a small multimodal that is just as good though by using multiple smaller models and just tokenizing everything separately as a small swarm. Especially if interference is well integrated and they have started context and very high memory bandwidth.",

Corporations will always present a more polished product. \n\nThese models have a fundamental problem that most people seem to ignore. They are too computationally expensive to make sense in large scale, they make far too many mistakes to drive decision making, it\u2019s easy to break the illusion of intelligence if you \u201cask\u201d the correct questions to it. And honestly open source is going towards a more realistic approach of getting these tools to run on \u201ceveryday\u201d hardware and indexing the content to be a better search tool. \n\nDo not undermine the fact that just like crypto, AI is here to raise money from investors.",

At this point it just seems barely usable in production grade apps.\n2. Open AI's GPT models still don't have long term memory... Apparently, the trick they pull under the hood in order to maintain context is to resend the previous conversation thread back to the model along with every user input. This is beyond inefficient, and it means users like me have to post stuff on reddit to get karma points so they can ask about Retrieval Augmented Generation and Open AI Embeddings within Vector Databases..  \n\n\nI mean, serious question: why isn't a company funded with billions able to create a simple support for long term memory for each user's inputs? Notice I'm not talking about documents or other multimodal stuff. Just the conversation thread...In summary, no, I believe Open AI has a good MODEL which has increased efficiency due to their big data sets.... Not a good product as of yet.",

Using open source and adapt it to your needs has a huge advantage compared to sharing data with big AI providers. As ML engineer I find more attractive/convenient in the long term deploying a HF model and RAG API on a company kubernetes cluster than calling an API from Google or openAI, if the model behaves incorrectly I have a way to fix it fine tuning it and/or changing the model",

Barely any other company or OSS-contributing individual / organisation will risk replicasting those violations because they wouldn't take such risks.

It's like trying to beat AWS for cloud hosting but actually even more difficult. The companies that have the resources to compete are typically outbid by OpenAI/Microsoft salaries (and now a sort of fame/prestige for working for them).\n\nThe only ones who might stand a chance at the moment is Google, though it is obvious they're playing a little bit of catch up despite having some previous advancements that could have had them beat ChatGPT to market.\n\nIn this situation open source won't catch up unless there is a wall to the scalability of the systems, which there does seem to be but it will still be a very long time before consumer hardware can match what OpenAI will be able to do.\n\nEven if open source increases effectiveness by 100x, ChatGPT would still be better because of the large system architecture.",

        "body": "While I agree with your argument I think there\u2019s an exception for this specific application. \nI\u2019m a PhD candidate and my specialization is on ML. As far as ML goes, whoever has data and compute are the king. Especially data !! Without quality data you can\u2019t enable ML applications. \nThe big guys already have it. They have been harvesting data from us for years and years together. Moreover we use all their products everyday and they\u2019re going to get more data from us. I don\u2019t see a way for open source to catch up to that. It would take massive systematic collaborative undertaking at a scale we haven\u2019t seen before. By the time we open source folks come up with something they would have already collected exponentially amount of data more than when we started xD \n\nThe next is compute. You need a lot of compute to be able to quickly iterate prototype and debug models. GPUs are bloody expensive. Sure there are projects like llama cpp trying to optimize things. While we have to come up with workarounds companies can simply throw more compute at the problem and solve it. \n\nAs a researcher these two points have been a source of misery for me. I need to wait for my slot in a time shared gpu cluster tp run my experiments. Meanwhile google will publish a paper saying they ran their model on 50 TPUs for a week. Interns in google have access to practically unlimited compute. Corporate research in ML is actually ahead of academic research in generative AI simply because of the disparity in compute and data. Some of them are not even innovative from the idea perspective. To give you an example CLIP by openAI. I personally know of PhD students who were working on the exact same architecture as CLIP. The idea isn\u2019t sophisticated or niche. Those students couldn\u2019t get the compute needed to run it. By the time they could do enough engineering to make it work on the limited compute they had openAI published it already. \n\nI wish and want open source to catch up but I simply don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen. \n\nRegarding products, companies have vested interest in building and improving Ml models. Combined with their monopoly over data and compute the reality is that it\u2019s very very very easy for them to churn out stuff compared to open source. \n\nWhile in other areas I would normally agree with you I think in ML challenges are more significant",

        "body": "I mean it's pretty hard to keep a programming language closed.  Someone can just mimic your API and users won't care.  For instance Visual J++ was totally valid until it became clear that Microsoft was acting in bad faith.  But closed source compilers still exist for sure.  \n\nApples and oranges anyway as I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that LLMs or AI can never have viable open source models.  But this is bleeding edge tech where capital investment really does pay dividends, in terms of training data and processing power.  And there are people willing to spend a *lot* of money for models that perform even marginally better, because they've already found ways to monetize it.  \n\nWhich means more money for the current market leader, which they can obviously invest in more training data and better infrastructure.  But they also become the only ones with significant real-world usage data and feedback.  This is why I see it much more like Adobe or Microsoft than Sun Microsystems.  \n\nIf Google can't keep up, open source stands no chance.  If we care about open source AI, and I think we should, then we should be doing it through government-funded university consortiums, not github.  But if we're not willing to fund training data and infrastructure then we shouldn't expect a truly equivalent alternative.  I mean if we did a survey here of a) where everyone's sending their money and b) who they think has the best model (maybe the same question?), would anyone be surprised OpenAI has engineers making over a mil?\n\nIt's funny because this subreddit will celebrate \"Open\"AI infringing trademarks one day and then lament the lack of open source alternatives the next, which makes me think people don't see where this is going.  People who loved MS-DOS in 1982 hated Microsoft by 1998, and people who loved using Photoshop in 1992 were crying about subscriptions by 2013.",

It\u2019s because it\u2019s 1) pretty 2) easy to use by the most people (least technical) possible and 3) office integration.\n\nLinux distros have certainly made improvements in these areas, but that\u2019s not their primary focus. Until as much effort is put into making it pretty, easy to use, and accessible to general people, windows will continue to doninate.\n\nThat isn\u2019t even taking into account that a bulk of existing software can\u2019t be run on linux (again, strides here, but still a gap).\n\nSo compare that to ai. The interface is simplistic. The power comes from how it works. This is where the linux/open source crowd shines - raw functionality.\n\nThere are some good points in the post about data availability and annotation, as well as the hardware issue which will certainly be a new paradigm for the open source crowd, and only time will tell if that can be adapted too, but so far things are looking very, very promising.\n\nMistral/mixtral is very capable for example, and can run on cheaply available hardware. It\u2019s not gpt4, but so what? I have a subscription to gpt4 and I can\u2019t use that for much anyway because of the strict limit of requests they let me have.\n\nIn addition, their refusal to tell me what request number I\u2019m on puts up a psychological barrier for me personally that makes me not even want to use it when I need to sometimes.\n\nSo I use mistral for most things, gpt3 for language practice because of the audio interface (I\u2019m very much looking forward to an open source replacement for that), and gpt4 for the few things it can do that the others can\u2019t.\n\nVery likely, with time, open source will close that gap. I don\u2019t see this as comparable to the windows vs other os situation at all.",

For example, \"iOS is an better mobile OS than Android / iPhone is a better phone than Android because of brand value\" does not seem to be a strong argument for me.\n* One thing related to brand loyalty, lock-in effect, could be relevant (\"iOS is better than Android because their appstore has more apps\"), but currently there's no much lock-in effect for OpenAI (I think that they're currently trying to create it though). For example, there's almost no friction for migrating from OpenAI's chat endpoints to Google's Gemini.\n* I disagree with original post's #4 for another reason: if there's an open-source model better than GPT-4, then surely some company would provide it as a service, wouldn't they?",

I meant something like \"it's too focused on the individuals\" but let's just ignore it.\n\nThe poster in the screenshot is assuming that tech is like a professional sport, where we gather the best players and have them compete. Higher salaries directly correlate to the better players.\n\nUnlike professional sports, unknown \"players\" can walk in and play against your professionals in tech. What are the chances that an amateur exists who can beat the professionals? No one knows.\n\nOn 4 I think you and I are talking about different things. I'm talking about competitors or individuals' ability to build a product and you're talking about brand/product loyalty. I actually can't tell which the original poster meant.\n\nBut I'm still paying openai despite the decreased performance so your point has some merit!",

Just like trying to scale a physical server is prohibitively expensive and difficult compared to cloud compute. Except it's actually worse because their cloud arrays are filled with hardware consumers don't typically even have. \n\nThere just literally needs to be a wall for ChatGPT to hit to cause open source to catch up.",

On docs Claude is hands down still the best.  and i don\u2019t even pay for it yet but might soon.  \n\ntoday pissed me off tho it was like,  no i will not write you any code unless you prove to me you will be ethical.  like wtfffff is that ???? \n\nif you don\u2019t want your ai doing something for users fine but don\u2019t tell it to tell us that we need to prove this or that to it.  that\u2019s actually quite an insane thing do to but hopefully that\u2019s very pivotable.\n\ni think it\u2019s part of it is an overt nerfing but also the cracking down of copyright bullshit.  \n\nthis behavior from UK but especially what Canada has done is appalling and embarrassing for their country.  \n\nOur entire government secretly running social media for so long and how it\u2019s playing out now,  we should be embarrassed too.  i think our situation is just as bad if not worse then Canada\u2019s.  \n\nboth are just bad very bad.  evil fucking people .\n\nedit:  i was able to get small but measurable improvements by using flattery and asking it to review a list of explicit conditions as it\u2019s first task each time",

        "body": "I agree with your analysis. \n\nI have crashed it with machine learning bug requests. Sometimes it gets stuck \u201cthinking\u201d and I lose a request. A few bugs to work out. Can\u2019t attach files yet which sucks.\n\nI have gotten 2 policy violations for asking it to review my log and analyze the bug. (Wtf?) . 4o answered same prompts fine. I guess someone felt sorry for me at OpenAI because they reset my o1 preview and o1 mini tokens because I was out of o1 preview and they sent me a fresh batch, idk somehow it unlocked again 1 week ahead of schedule. Hopefully they raise the limit within a month.\n\nAnother problem It goes off on tangents about how this was the problem (it wasn\u2019t) then this was the problem (nope wasn\u2019t that either), ok sorry so it has to be this? (nope it\u2019s not). So problem solving is not its forte if it\u2019s a lay up. It tells you to change things you don\u2019t ask for or need to. It omits previous code you gave it and \u201cforgets\u201d (a big problem with many GPTs is they leave out code from previously given script).\n\nAnyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that\u2019s not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.\n\nI am not a coder (I have learned to \u201cread\u201d but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. \n\nThe other problem with o1 is the amount of \u201ccontent\u201d it gives out. It fills a chat up with each \u201canswer\u201d and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don\u2019t need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.\n\nI get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this \u201cpreview\u201d and \u201cmini\u201d were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0\n\nI\u2019m Excited to see what Gemini and Claude next gen releases look like, even Grok 2.5/3. We are all in a treat in the next 12 months.",

I don't know if it's true, but it's what it feels like. \n\nTo be more specific, you ask o to do something complex. The result isn't quite there all the way. So you give it a second prompt telling it what it missed and what you want different about it. It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. \n\nI feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel. I think for most usecases you can have similar results with very good prompts with perhaps a follow up or two for refinement.",

I was thinking the Bing AI had a point to be paranoid as that reporter was indeed trying to crack it and also who doesn\u2019t then love reporters with all their objectivity(many of them)? So was kind of cute.\n\nI guess software is released too early all the time and bugs are fixed we hope so that\u2019s why some people like Beta testing whereas others don\u2019t like paying to be early adopters.",

Most importantly for this subreddit, it's #1 on [CRUX](https://crux-eval.github.io/) (benchmark for code reasoning), topping even Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nI know that OpenAI originally released this as a model that could produce better [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), but it's obviously more than that (for example, it's also 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% cheaper on outputs than the previous 4o).\n\nIf anyone wants to try it for coding within your IDE, we already added it to [double.bot](https://docs.double.bot/introduction?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=gpt4o-launch-1) where you can use it for free (we add all the new models the same day they are released).",

Zoom into that, look at the subcategories, and go try it yourself. Then check LMSys in a couple of days.",

        "body": "As someone building in the AI space, I think the competition is more nuanced than a winner-takes-all scenario. Each major player has unique advantages - OpenAI excels at reasoning/coding (their new O-1 family), Google at multimodal/search integration (Gemini), and Anthropic at safety/alignment (Claude).\n\n\n\nThe real challenge isn't just model performance, but building products people actually want to use. OpenAI's early focus on user experience and developer ecosystem gives them a significant edge, similar to how Apple didn't need the best hardware specs to dominate smartphones.\n\n\n\nThat said, Google's vast data and compute resources shouldn't be underestimated. The future will likely have multiple strong players serving different needs, which is ultimately better for innovation and consumers.",

It's a rumour, but I am sure it will happen with all the hints Logan gave us.\n\nDeepseek V3 has now topped Sonnet in some benchamarks here and there, and OAI announced the O3, a very expensive model, and they just showed a demo... Seemed like Sora and AVM announcement, something that could take a long lomg time until us, peasants have the possibility to test/use.\n\nOAI need to drop something until late february. Until there competition is going to be better, and I am not even talking about Anthropic which seems to be cooking forever ...\n\nAs soon as the realtime stream and screen share reaches Gemini Pro and Gemini Live along with deepsearch, and the Gemini agents; Jules, Astra and Mariner arrive in the road.\n\nYou better bet Google will showcase a super marketing campaign rather than just shout news at X.\n\nIn the long run Gemini will devour the whole IoT it already posesses, OAI will have to focus on push forcing newest standards for SoTA models, GPT5 must arrive soon, and meet expectations, because if we relly on O3 costing 1000 USD per request...

        "body": "First you need to split out consumer from enterprise.  The deal with Microsoft, so far, gives them very good access to enterprise as there is no company on this planet with better Enterprise reach than Microsoft.\n\nThe issue with this arrangement is that it is not clear if Microsoft at some point will try to compete against OpenAI in this space.   Microsoft is going to have their own best interest in mind.\n\nOn the consumer side is where it is so much more difficult for OpenAI.   Microsoft really just does not help much here. and it is where Google just accels.\n\nThere is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.\n\nTake cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.\n\nSame story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.\n\nThen there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.\n\nThen there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.\n\nBut that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.\n\nSo you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.\n\nEven new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.\n\nThere just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.\n\nThe big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.\n\nI believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.\n\nThey will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.\n\nAstra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.\n\nBTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.\n\nPlus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.\n\nThe other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.\n\nThat is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868\n\nOr how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.",

While I still think ChatGPT is often technically the best, they allowed others to catch up enough that the benchmarks occasionally have another vendor in the technical lead.\n\nAs such, the new pricing for OpenAi\u2019s best model is a huge risk. If OpenAI was light years ahead of the other vendors this would be fine; but that\u2019s not the case. If the other vendors have the cash to burn and decide to maintain a cheaper price for their best models, then OpenAI will start to hemorrhage users. The goal would be to push OpenAI into bankruptcy.\n\nPerhaps the main competitors will follow OpenAI\u2019s pricing example, which I\u2019m sure is what OpenAI hopes will happen. If OpenAI heads for bankruptcy, it would seem likely that Microsoft will be in a great position to take advantage of this.",

And it can basically do unlimited scale as long as I have the money, both on the AI side and on other technical infra.

        "body": "The quality of ChatGPT's output has been disappointing lately. Today, I asked it to rewrite a letter to a hospital, but the result was surprisingly poor - it read like it was written by a teenager, with numerous incorrect word choices. Ironically, my original letter was of much higher quality. I was hoping to get a bit better ending of the letter.\n\nI find it puzzling that despite OpenAI's claims of market leadership, my experience with ChatGPT has been subpar. Even smaller language models, including 8B parameter models running locally, have provided better results. ChatGPT's performance seems to fall well below current industry standards.",

Ability to access funding and raw compute could be a massive physical limitation that prevents Chinese companies from catching up with current leaders anytime this decade (China is probably several years, ~3-10, away from producing their initial EUV lithography machines, whereas ASML is already developing their second and third generations). With the West\u2019s current lead over China in semiconductor capabilities, China faces the possibility that they\u2019re not able to close the gap within the next 5-10 years (accounting for continued Western progress). That might not seem like a lot of time relative to normal human scales of a \u2018long time\u2019, but the rate of advancement in AI is so insane (it\u2019s exponential) that it might be to guarantee Western dominance for the rest of the century.\n\nThis depends on whether raw compute scaling (training, inference, or otherwise) will continue to provide massive gains in efficiency (which I think it likely will, but that remains to be seen).",

A choice between the two doesn't have to be made, just give the user a setting to toggle between automatic and chosen. Those that want automatic have it by default, those who want to choose can toggle the setting.\n\nCustomizeability ensures everyone is satisfied.",

        "body": "Yo u/No_Wheel_9336, sorry for posting on a NSFW account (I dont have a SFW one), but I was googling some questions and came across this post and had to comment. I was one of the first, if not \\*the\\* first person to take the leap on your GPTEverywhere app and buy it, so I was really surprised to see the dev in the wild.  \nI have no criticisms. Its a great app that allowed me, someone without any knowledge of how to even start deploying local LLMs, to have incredible access to ML power on my desktop. The ability to use OpenRouter keys is incredible and I feel like an absolute hack3r-man being able to swap between models on the fly depending on my needs.\n\n  \nMostly, I just wanted to thank you for putting in the work to make this app, and also for including those video tutorials for noobs like myself. I recently finished a PhD in a very difficult STEM field (dont want to expose my NSFW alter-ego so I wont say exactly what discipline), and GPTEverywhere was CRUCIAL to its completion. In particular, the ability to upload 100s of academic articles as well as massive scripts and query the selections that I needed was a godsend to my workflow.\n\nAnyways, sorry for popping up on a month-old. I left the first review for your app on the MS store so I hope that helped get the ball rolling. Quick unsolicited comment: not sure if you have added a free trial yet for the app, but if not, I think it would really help sell. People are suspicious of $30 apps no matter how well-intentioned they are. If there was a way for people to see how legit GPTEverywhere is for themselves, I know for a fact more people would be buying. Peace!!",

        "body": "Random NSFW account here (I dont have a SFW one but I wanted to respond), so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I took the leap a couple months ago when there were 0 reviews for GPTEverywhere on a whim and was genuinely surprised. It takes a little time to get all of your API keys and models set up, but if youre willing to spend an hour watching the included tutorials and getting everything in place, its a damn good app. The $30 price tag is intimidating, and if there was more competition I think I would tell people to look elsewhere, but considering its a Microsoft Store app that can run most common LLMs on your desktop and requiring virtually no experience setting up local models, I'm quite happy with it.  \nYou might be some LLM giga-chad who knows other ways to do it, but if youre just moderately experienced like myself, I would genuinely suggest it. I left a review on the store saying if there were a free trial more people would buy it, but I havent seen any movement on that. \n\nJust my two-cents, feel free to ignore or dunk on my inferior knowledge in the replies.

Claude 3 does not have this issue with up to 200K tokens whatsoever, so even if its coding capabilities are lesser than GPT-4, it may actually be more useful in scenarios where you have a lot of code in context.",

I don't know why people keep trashing on o1 but to me, it's simply the most capable model in every single field (perhaps other than coding which I haven't tested). Having it write either deeply insightful, well-argued or highly literary text has been absolutely insane. It REALLY knows what it's talking about in a way that makes other models truly feel like statistical prediction \"machines\".",

It\u2019s top of the class across the board however, coding is always bouncing back with Claude as the best in forums.\n\nI am not a programmer and mainly work back from UI development but last couple of weeks have been using o1 to help teach me python. As a non programmer (these guys are the wizards of the stack and deserve the hat-tilt!), I\u2019d guess that although o1 is doing a fantastic job of deciding, deploying, changing and re-writing code it lands perfectly with mi, a beginner.\n\nReal code development is still sitting in Claude. Time will tell but I suspect as currently the torch is on OpenAI they are focusing on shiny-trinket product deployment atm, I fink they will catchup on Claude later.\n\n*jus my lil two cents, thx for posting*",

This means I can see scenarios where the user needs to \u201cwork harder\u201d to write better, more detailed prompts to get the most out of o1. Other models before o1 tend to make assumptions about the prompt and automatically enrich or expand on it, but I find o1 to be more loyal to the original prompt. So like if you just casually ask it to write or explain something in a short sentence, it might do a seemingly \u201cworse\u201d job than other models, but it will absolutely destroy other models if you compose your prompt thoughtfully. I definitely prefer o1\u2019s approach here because models aren\u2019t supposed to give users what they \u201cthink\u201d they want, but rather what users state they want.",

It did really well so if re-issued with o1 model the sky is the limit.\n\nPersonally I start stuff on 4o \u2018Willy nilly\u2019 - back , forth, try, fail, rewrite, start a new prompt and repeat. If I have to call o1 then it\u2019s planning time and try to find the points of failure in my head first and give it a real overall task. *seems to be going well so far*",

        "body": "Sure I\u2019ll post an example below. So I gave 4o and o1 the same exact prompt:\n\nTry to express the following sentence/sentiment in the most authentic, elegant, and beautiful American English prose possible. It should be an exploration and expansion of this concept. keep it to about 200 words. Approach it with literary flair and depth. The result should be deeply impactful to a human reader. Here it is:\n\nTimes Square (in New York City) captures the magic, promise and elusiveness of the American dream.\n\n4o\u2019s response:\nTimes Square stands as a dazzling embodiment of the magic, promise, and fleeting nature of the American Dream. Beneath its towering screens and kaleidoscope of neon lights, the square pulses with the energy of possibility\u2014a space where ambition collides with opportunity, where dreams flicker as brightly as the billboards above. It\u2019s a place where the world\u2019s aspirations seem to converge, reflecting not only the boundless potential of reinvention but also the relentless pace of a society always chasing the next big thing.\n\nYet, in its brilliance lies an elusiveness, a reminder that the American Dream, for all its allure, is not guaranteed but earned, and sometimes imagined. The hurried crowds, the constant shuffle of faces from every corner of the globe, and the ceaseless din of the city form a symphony of longing and achievement. Times Square is a paradox, both grounding and ephemeral\u2014a beacon for those who dream of a better life and a testament to the complexities of reaching it. It is as much a celebration of hope as it is a reflection of the sacrifices, struggles, and occasional disillusionment that come with chasing the light. It is, perhaps, the dream\u2019s truest mirror.\n\nO1\u2019s response:\nThere is something both wondrous and elusive about Times Square, that bright, pulsating heart of Manhattan\u2019s midriff. To stand there is to teeter at the crossroads of myth and memory, to feel in your bones the electric hum of dreams in transit\u2014some gliding gracefully overhead, others snarled in the taut wires of ambition. It\u2019s a place born of restless imagination: flamboyant signs and shimmering screens that announce, without modesty, that here anything might happen. Men and women converge from every corner of the earth, clutching their aspirations like tickets to a long-awaited show. Sometimes, these dreams step forward into the glow of possibility; sometimes they drift into the night, subtle sparks fading in the cacophony.\n\nYet Times Square insists on reminding us that hope need not be reasonable, and promise need not be certain. The America it presents\u2014loud, unapologetic, brimming with potential\u2014offers no guarantees. Instead, it offers an invitation: come, risk, believe. Underneath the flashing neon and the relentless press of crowds is the quiet understanding that so much of what we call the American dream resides in the space between yearning and becoming. In Times Square, that space trembles, alive and lit from within.\n\n\nSo in my opinion o1 absolutely kills it compared to all other models including 3.5 Sonnet or 3 Opus, and of course 4o.",

If it receives questions pertaining to my partner\u2019s field of study, it knows they\u2019re from her. \n\nThis has impacted the memory settings in that it now stores memories of both of us, such as \u201c[me] is learning how to use X technology\u201d or \u201c[partner] has progressed from learning Y to learning Z.\u201d \n\nNot sure how this can be helpful, or if it can be at all, but I thought it was a cool effect to observe.",

        "body": "I've heard of people maxing out their ChatGPT memory and receiving an error saying they can't store any more. To fix this, they copy all their memories from the \"Manage\" window into a text file, delete them from the ChatGPT interface, then they review and group them to remove redundancies and some things that weren't really worth remembering.\n\nAfterward, they paste the cleaned-up chunks back into a conversation, asking ChatGPT to store summarized versions of the longer texts. This helps streamline the memories, which can sprawl over time and include irrelevant details.\n\nI tried this once as a test, even though I hadn't hit the memory limit. It worked well\u2014ChatGPT took the large, sprawling memory chunks I had apparently organically stored and summarized them into a more coherent version.\n\nIt\u2019s something you might need to do eventually if your stored memories start to get out of hand.",

If they don\u2019t need that, they can/will use the free version. \n\nLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re right and there\u2019s demand for a $5 tier. If just 1 million of the current 10 million subscribers drop to the lower tier, they'd need to add another **3 million new users** just to get back to their current monthly revenue.  \n\nI\u2019m unsure how else to explain it\u2014this idea benefits no one. It\u2019s a worse deal for both OpenAI and consumers. They already offer a free tier, a pay-per-token model, and a $20 unlimited cap.  \n\nyou're arguing you want them to make more money, but you want them to have a cheaper product, bundle it with other services (which cuts even more into any profit), and potentially lose money in the process while adding nothing of value.",

Sometimes they're experimenting with a different set of sampling parameters, or a new version of a model, and they simply want to see if users on average tend to prefer the new version over the old one. If feedback is positive, then that's a good sign for them. If the feedback is tied or skewed towards the old model, then they know they messed up and they'll pursue a different path.\n\n2. Sometimes, they're gathering feedback to see which model users prefer in a certain scenario. For example, showing a 4o and o1 response next to each other. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses at the moment, and the OpenAI team has been clear about their plans to design a system where the appropriate model gets intelligently chosen based on the prompt.",

        "title": "ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.",
        "body": "What an ignorant post. Asking ChatGPT why this happens and a technical explanation would likely help you understand why this happens. Let\u2019s see;\n\nThe post draws attention to an issue some users experience with ChatGPT: receiving incorrect answers, which might seem puzzling, especially for simple, factual questions (e.g., \u201cWho starred in this movie?\u201d). While the user assumes it\u2019s because the system is prioritizing speed, what\u2019s actually happening is a bit more nuanced.\n\n### Why ChatGPT Sometimes Gives Wrong Answers:\n1. **Model Limitations**: ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a huge dataset. While it has incredible capability to generate human-like text, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s fundamentally a predictive model. This means it generates answers based on patterns in the data it\u2019s trained on\u2014**statistically likely responses**\u2014rather than looking up specific facts from a live, updated database (like Google would).\n   \n   Instead of \u201cknowing\u201d facts, ChatGPT guesses based on the data it has seen, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies, especially if its training data contains conflicting or outdated information.\n\n2. **Training Data Cutoff**: ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date (for example, my current training data goes up to sometime around September 2021). This means it doesn\u2019t know any factual information added or updated after that date, which can easily lead to mistakes if the user asks for things that have changed.\n\n3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, even basic questions can be difficult for the model when the questions themselves allow for multiple correct or nuanced answers. For example, if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or common movie roles across different countries, the model might provide an answer based on a statistical guess that ultimately turns out to be wrong.\n\n4. **Confidence without Fact-Checking**: While ChatGPT generates responses that sound coherent and confident, it does not have real-time fact-checking mechanisms. This gives the impression that it \u201cknows\u201d things with certainty when in reality it might be generating a likeliest-sounding answer without verifying its factual accuracy.\n\n### Why Speed Alone Isn\u2019t the Issue:\nThe author claims ChatGPT has been programmed to prioritize speed at the expense of accuracy. While response time is certainly a factor (OpenAI wants the model to be as responsive as possible), **speed is not the root cause of factual errors**. The real challenges come from the nature of how these models work:\n- They predict language based on patterns, rather than looking up facts in real time.\n- Even if ChatGPT were slower, if it didn\u2019t cross-check against an up-to-date database, the response would still carry the same risk of inaccuracy.\n\n### Could ChatGPT Be Made Slower and More Accurate?\nIn theory, if ChatGPT were connected to a real-time database (like performing web searches in real time), it could slow the response but increase factual accuracy. Some AI systems use methods like this, blending language generation with fact-checking. However, models like ChatGPT (in its base form) typically don\u2019t pull in live information to fact-check responses\u2014they rely entirely on prior training.\n\n\u2014\n\n**Summary**: The errors aren\u2019t caused by a system that\u2019s simply built for speed over accuracy, but by how models like ChatGPT are designed to work. They are language models that predict text based on patterns, not search engines that look up facts. Thus, they can make mistakes or give confidently wrong answers when the underlying patterns don\u2019t line up with factual, up-to-date data. Improvement in factual generation would likely require structural changes, such as integrating real-time information retrieval, rather than simply slowing down response times.",

Anyone who doesn't invest time in learning new AI tools will be unemployed and unemployable within 5-7 years.\n\nI saw the people who resisted personal computers. I saw people who resisted the internet. I saw people who resisted smartphones.  But with all those technologies, the timescale for adoption was much longer.  The AI system that is going to take your job is already being built right now.\n\n>should I be using Playground?\n\nI started using the Playground because ChatGPT Plus was metering output, and I couldn't have that kind of disruption.\n\nI build my own AI systems using the OpenAI API.  You can learn to do this, but it is a steep learning curve.  But because I've had fine control over my system, I never found any use for the Assistants and GPTs.  I was not particularly impressed by its ability to hold documents in memory. It was (at least in the beginning, when I tried it) a poor implementation of vector encoding and searching.  It was never as context aware as it needed to be to actually be useful.\n\nAnyway... in terms of cost, the Playground is pay as you go, and very useful... but I like where ChatGPT's interface is right now, so I'm very happy using ChatGPT Plus even though I have the playground.  I stuck with it because I wanted to use realtime voice, and enjoy their other cutting-edge UI features.\n\nYou should also check out Claude, and consider getting an account there at anthropic instead. It's excellent. Possibly better than GPT-4.",

        "body": "> Should I be concerned? I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life. But it feels like it is degrading, not improving. There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.\n\nI think the answer is no, but you need to manage your expectations better. \n\nMost people's first productive experience with ChatGPT is seen through rosy colored glasses. I see people say \"ChatGPT used to be so good\", but in my experience it hasn't changed in its quality. What has changed in my experience is the complexity of what I ask it to do. The more I learn what it can do, the more I lean on it to do those things, and as I venture further into territories that I can only traverse with the aid of GPT, the harder it becomes to use reliably. This is a me problem, not a ChatGPT problem.\n\nDuring peak hours I will notice GPT will seem more interested in helping me help myself rather than helping me by solving a problem. Obviously OpenAI has some flow control to ensure all customers have enough resources to complete their tasks. You might be trying to use it at peak hours. Have you tried using the API? I have never seen the quality waver at all with the API. \n\n> I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling. Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.\n\nThey're not struggling at all. OpenAI, the company, isn't making money, but that is normal. They're backed by billionaires and big orgs like Microsoft who pretty much guarantee that they're never closing their doors. \n\nWhat has become clear is that ChatGPT as an interface for their product is not going to be a net positive money maker for a long time, until the compute costs go down. But that's okay because what OpenAI wants is to be the vendor of AI's to other orgs, allowing them to see how companies are using AI so that they can build better products rather than other orgs building their own AI from scratch and potentially taking OpenAI's business. \n\nRight now AI is a platform/destination, but the future of AI is enterprise and local models. This company is going nowhere. \n\nTheir issues are also largely out of their control. They need more compute and its expensive to buy and its unwise to go all in on today's tech when this is still cutting edge software running on cutting edge hardware. The cost of moving fast like this is in the form of inconsistent quality/availability of the product. \n\nI strongly recommend that you start using the API (for a lot of people its cheaper than the 20/mo, depending on how often you use GPT) if you're concerned about quality/downtime. If you're using ChatGPT a lot (such as maxing out your usage quota multiple times a day) then you should consider that OpenAI is incentivized to throttle users on the monthly subscription who use more compute than their $20 should buy them. I suspect this is why the API has never wavered in quality in my experience, because I'm paying per prompt.",

        "body": "Near term I might be worried. I could see ChatGPT continuing random declines based on content moderation, cheapness, and weird legal issues that are nibbling at the edges quickly right now. Medium term, months or years, I expect quality to improve dramatically as various forms of competition emerge and niche diversification happens. Not an expert but off the top of my head we have X, Apple, Google, Meta, and Anthropic all working on making a better LLM pretty seriously. I'd expect either a worthy successor to pop up or ChatGPT itself to improve significantly over the next couple of years. Unless there's a truly epic fail in the regulation department driven right at the heart of an emerging industry that might prove vital for international competition I don't think any of the issues that are currently dragging down OpenAI will be indefinite issues.\n\nFor the big problems:\n\n\\-Content moderation is quite annoying as currently done but I think diversification will figure that out in a few years. I could see X or Apple becoming the owner of the LLM people use for fiction and roleplay even if other models stick to dumb moderation guidelines. If nothing else NovelAI is ideologically committed to making a viable alternative for chat and fiction without censorship, even if it may lag behind state of the art considerably.\n\n\\-Cheapness could shake out in a bunch of different ways, but with competition and rabid investment I doubt escalating declines in quality could possibly win out over the course of a few years. It is theoretically possible that LLMs are just not cost effective at scale, but that seems really unlikely to me.\n\n\\-Weird legal and regulatory issues are the biggest concern IMO. I have no idea if say, weird pieces being ripped out of LLMs capabilities because of litigiousness or poorly written law might become a major issue, and right now it's at least having a chilling effect. I think it'll probably work out as the benefits are so big, but countries can absolutely gut industries for stupid reasons and keep them gutted indefinitely.\n\nOverall I am an optimistic on LLMs. I think nobody wants to risk losing a major economic or military advantage, so laws will bend in favor of LLM use overtime and technical abilities seem destined to improve a fair amount even under relatively pessimistic estimations of peak capabilities for LLMs. The challenges are real, but there's not a lot of evidence for raw pessimism right now based on my understanding of things.",

All these companies have crazy guard rails. but cosnidering we're all forced to be confined within their ring, at least Gemini is going to be way more powerful and vastly expanded and opened up. Early reports of the assistant AI seems like it could go mainstream, it's so good.",

But Gemini v2 and 4o mini is already good enough for a wide range of tasks. So I found models like DeepSeek to be not useful to me.

        "body": "And while we're at it, when it comes to animated films, there were these articles about them and Sora:\n\n> **OpenAI\u2019s Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**\n> \n> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.\n> \n> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.\n> \n> According to OpenAI:\n> \n> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.\n> \n> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3\u2019s recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora\u2019s case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, \u201cthe model is able to follow the user\u2019s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.\u201d\n> \n> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:\n>\n> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators\n> \n> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.\n> \n> **What are Sora\u2019s shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn\u2019t have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.\n> \n> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a \u201cdetection classifier\u201d that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company\u2019s Dall-E software, which doesn\u2019t allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.\n> \n> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.\n> \n> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We\u2019ve included a few here, but there are dozens more.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl2o_iBCINk\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZeBpSXtBoA\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8MMi7ZPYvc\n\nhttps://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/openais-sora-creates-minute-long-photorealistic-animation-from-text-prompts-238060.html\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

        "body": "What? Why would this happen? If AI gives people more buying power or free time (free time has trended higher in developed nations with increases in technology) then they\u2019ll want to consume even more media. AI tools will assist media production, but we are decades away from that killing Hollywood. Sure, it might become less consolidated\u2026 it\u2019ll be easier for Indy producers to compete. But the end of Hollywood is so far away.\n\nAnyone who thinks that in 3yrs you\u2019ll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that\u2019s not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many \u201ctries\u201d it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all. Most likely, this tool will be prohibitively expensive, and any speculation about how fast that cost will come down is just that \u2014 pure speculation. There is no guarantee that chip supplies will bring prices down, that we\u2019ll have big innovations in hardware or software that make it feasible to drop prices to compete, etc etc. there\u2019s no reason to think prices will come down faster than at a slow trickle.\n\nIn the next couple decades, things will change a bit. In the next 50yrs, shit will probably be unrecognizable. Companies will still be in charge of media then too, but maybe not in the way we see it now. Even then you probably won\u2019t just tell a computer to generate you a season of TV. Who would watch that? Have you considered the social aspect of TV, that people like to watch the same thing, together, at the same time, and then discuss it in person or online? That there\u2019s a reason we have the word \u201ccelebrity\u201d? How many people write a book, and then when asked what books they\u2019re reading, are like \u201cI\u2019m reading my own book? It\u2019s so good!\u201d \n\nMedia produced by individuals will increase in market share just like we\u2019ve seen with YouTube. But big producers are not going away.",

        "body": "(Continuing...)\n\n> **Sora And The Future of Animation Industry**\n> \n> **What is Sora (by OpenAi)?**\n> \n> OpenAI just rolled out another artificial intelligence powered tool called Sora and I have to say it is pretty mind-blowing. Picture this: you type up whatever scene pops into your head, hit enter, and bam, there\u2019s your video. Turning thoughts into visuals with a few words. But as cool as it sounds, it\u2019s got us in the creative industry doing a bit of a double-take. Sure, it\u2019s a game-changer for making content but it should get us all creatives thinking and talking about where the lines are drawn.\n> \n> How do we balance this incredible power to conjure up videos and animations from thin air and make sure it is used wisely?\n> \n> **Sora and Future of Creative Jobs**\n> \n> As the creative director of an animation company, I\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on how AI is shaking things up in our field. One thing that\u2019s been on my mind a lot is how technologies like Sora are changing the job landscape for folks in creative professions. Sure, AI has the chops to handle some tasks on its own, possibly nudging some jobs to the side.\n> \n> But it\u2019s important to remember that the spark of creativity and that gut feeling for art? Those are purely human. AI can\u2019t mimic that completely. So, rather than seeing AI as a stand-in for human creativity, I think it\u2019s better to view it as a tool that boosts what we can do. It lets us zero in on the really creative and subtle parts of our work, making our jobs not just easier, but more exciting, too.\n> \n> **Problem of Originality**\n> \n> There\u2019s something about AI that\u2019s been bothering many in the creative industry. It\u2019s all about how it learns from existing pool of artworks (illustrations, animation, typography etc)  to make something new. But does that really make it original or innovative? If AI just keeps going back to the same old stuff, aren\u2019t we just going around in circles with the same ideas? That could really put a damper on true creativity and the birth of fresh styles. Imagine the impact on the variety and depth of artistic expression if we let that happen.\n> \n> And let\u2019s not forget about what makes art, well, art. It\u2019s that human touch, the story of us, our dreams, our fears that are scribbled down, painted or animated. If we\u2019re leaning too much on AI, do we start to lose that personal signature that makes art resonate so deeply with us?\n> \n> **Use Sora in The Right Place**\n> \n> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.\n> \n> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.\n> \n> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It\u2019s like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.\n> \n> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**\n> \n> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.\n> \n> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don\u2019t own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.\n> \n> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It\u2019s essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.\n> \n> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**\n> \n> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.\n> \n> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It\u2019s crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.\n> \n> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**\n> \n> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry\u2019s evolution.\n> \n> **Final Thoughts**\n> \n> Wrapping up our talk, it\u2019s pretty obvious that OpenAI\u2019s Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we\u2019ve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.\n> \n> It\u2019s all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we\u2019re set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.\n\nhttps://www.kasradesign.com/sora-and-the-future-of-animation-industry/\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

        "body": "(Continuing...)\n\n> **A few thoughts on Sora**\n> \n> Yesterday, OpenAI announced Sora, a new product that generates realistic video from text prompts. The examples are remarkable.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anmuklFtu8U\n> \n> A TV writer friend texted me to ask \u201cis it time to be petrified?\u201d\n> \n> I wrote back:\n> \n> > I don\u2019t think you need to be petrified. It\u2019s very impressive at creating video in a way that\u2019s like how Dall-E does images. A huge achievement. For pre-viz? Mood reels? Incredible. We\u2019ll see stuff coming out of it used in commercials first.\n> > \n> > For longer, narrative stuff, there\u2019s a real challenge moving from text generation (gpt-4 putting together something that looks like a script) to \u201cfilming\u201d that script with these tools to resemble anything like our movies and television.\n> > \n> > Writers, directors, actors and crew have a sense of why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, and what makes sense in this fictitious reality they\u2019re creating. I don\u2019t think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.\n> \n> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.\n>\n> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.\n> \n> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be \u201credone\u201d with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we\u2019d consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What\u2019s the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?\n> \n> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn\u2019t filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn\u2019t come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can\u2019t let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.\n> \n> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to \u201cgeneral purpose simulators of the physical world.\u201d The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.\n> \n> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it\u2019s worth taking the progress they\u2019ve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.\n> \n> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it\u2019s doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they\u2019re not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2\n> \n> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn\u2019t explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:\n> \n> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes \u2014 one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning \u201cMinecraft.\u201d\n> \n> Sora \u201cgets\u201d Minecraft because it\u2019s ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it\u2019s able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it\u2019s able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for \u201cour\u201d reality?\n> \n> These are questions for philosophers, sure, but we\u2019re all going to be faced with them sooner than we\u2019d like. Sora and its descendants are going to have an impact beyond the cool video they generate.\n> \n> 1. Sora is a great name, btw. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, and doesn\u2019t have any specific connotation, yet feels like something that should exist.\n> \n> 2. Not to dive too deeply into theories of human consciousness, but the ability to internally model reality and predict things feel like table stakes.\n\nhttps://johnaugust.com/2024/a-few-thoughts-on-sora\n\nI also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:\n\n> > Doesn't matter if anyone can \"produce\" a \"Hollywood tier\" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.\n> \n> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in \"the brand\".\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krhaeoo/\n\n> > Pacing, plot, acting, design, etc etc. i think youre heavily mistaken if you think youre going to be able to just click generate and its going to give you a full length movie thats going to be awesome, its just completely unrealistic.\n> \n> Why? AI movies are trained based on existing works, so they can mimic the pacing, plot, acting etc the same way.\n> \n> \"make a movie in the style of Quentin Tarantino\" BOOM!\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krm4df1/\n\nGiven these and what you've seen from Sora, do you expect animation studios like Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, DreamWorks Animation, Illumination, Sony Pictures Animation, and so on to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora is officially released this year? Why or why not?\n\nP.S. I advise you all to read everything carefully before posting any comments.",

        "body": "I admit this is cool, but also to be fair this is 9s and the quality is way less than the other videos that they published with their Sora promo. Which is my point \u2014 there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can\u2019t increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs. Will there be innovations to get past these hurdles? Certainly. But we\u2019re not going from Sora clips to feature length films in a way that\u2019s going to eliminate Hollywood. It\u2019ll put downward pressure on salaries though",

If someone doesn't care enough to fix it, which is trivial with almost all gen apps, then you will see fucked up hands sometimes. For any commercial use, they will be able to fix the hands, and trivially.\n> \n> Copyright is going to be irrelevant to ai soon enough. You are still thinking about ai in the old format, where some studio make a movie and then sells that to people, just with the studio work being done by ai instead of humans.\n> \n> What we are going to see in the future are bespoke media, made for you by an ai at the time you request them. If you decide to watch a movie, you will tell it what genre/tags you want and it will create a movie for you as you watch it. And the hardware to generate something like that isn't actually that much more than a regular gaming PC, so it will be totally impossible to police copyright violations in that type of environment.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1bggglv/someone_who_claimed_to_have_worked_at_disney/kv82ysx/",

I\u2019m not sure what line of reasoning results in the idea that it would be a desirable thing people would pay for. Maybe that would work for 15s commercials or porn. But movies are known for their celebrities, for originality, storytelling, musical score, and for a whole genre - mystery/suspense. And most important of all, it\u2019s a social experience, so if people are all watching different movies that goes away. Technically we\u2019re so far away from this being possible, but also it won\u2019t be something people want outside niche groups. Again, I\u2019m referring to two hour movies and 10hr series, not much shorter formats. Maybe it could work for standup specials or something.",

I also use it to write responses to emails where I want to respond in a certain way but I just can't find the right words to use to convey the proper tone.I also use it to come up with cologne layering combos based on what's in my collection. It's helpful for all sorts of things though. I find that if I'm curious about something, let's say dashcams, I can just ask chatgpt about dashcams and it will provide me with a list of good options. \n\nYou can ask it about anything, like the best way to prepare for a camping trip or you can ask it to come up with a good workout routine for you. Some people even use it in place of an actual therapist. The best way to understand it is to give it a try.\n\nIf you subscribe to chatgpt plus you should also have access to its voice mode where you can literally talk to it almost like an actual human.",

        "body": "Srry i meant it seems it can take in 4m tokenes as input, but when i output, does it also output a large size like 4m or it only outputs like a few pages worth? Im asking because if i have 5 page notes and another 5 page notes and i ask it to summarize and combine, it should give me like 5 pages at the minimum not just 2-3, thats why i want to know output token size",

And likewise, Weaviate for instance provide tutorials with OpenAI API, as if both are meant to work together (as in with their Recommender tutorial on YouTube).\n\nThank you so much.",

This give us some time to comprehend and talk about solutions. We are probably feeling it cause we are the ones who are early adopters but if you look at the rest of the population/world it's not yet massively adopted by non-digital savvy people, managers and executives included. That's my hope actually but it's happening sooner or later AI will displace people, those who used these tools know it's a matter of time.",

This is insane. \n\nWe should have been lowering it this whole time as less of us are needed to provide food, shelter, and other necessities, but capitalism takes all of the productivity gains to improve their quarterly reports. They are going to take the gains from AI too unless something drastic happens to change how this works. \n\nThe problem is the world has never cared when people went hungry. It was happening in other countries, and to people in our country who \u201cwere lazy\u201d, and none of us helped or cared. It\u2019s about to happen in our country, to us. And nobody will care when it hits you if it isn\u2019t affecting them. \n\nI thought AI would hit the driving sector first with self-driving cars putting truck drivers, bus drivers, delivery drivers, etc out of work as fast as self-driving cars could be produced. Then I thought it was artists who would go first when these AI images started coming out. But I\u2019m thinking now it\u2019s hitting the tech industry (my industry) head on over the next couple years where it becomes a game of musical chairs with more of us fighting for less jobs.\n\nRegardless of which it hits first, the truckers won\u2019t care when the tech industry goes first. The tech industry won\u2019t care if the artists go first, etc. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t change it\u2019s going to be like when the auto industry pulled out of Detroit. Nobody helped them, and everybody said oh look the economy made new jobs without recognizing that those workers weren\u2019t the ones getting those jobs because they weren\u2019t trained properly for them or located in the right place.",

        "body": "It\u2019s been discussed for a long time. \n\nIt\u2019s not just AI, it\u2019s other technologies like:\n\n- life extension (if 120 will be the new 70, how will society have to change?)\n- gene editing (what happens if 1 country decides to make their babies 20% stronger/smarter/whatever)\n- brain-computer interfaces (Neuralink et al - when they go beyond treating medical issues and into augmentation, how do we handle that?)\n\nAlthough arguably it\u2019s AI that enables all of these things. They ARE going to happen, to some extent - they may not live up to the hype, may not be as effective, but they will happen in some form. \n\nSo, unfortunately, everything I\u2019ve read and talked about with experts (whose job it is to think about these things) leads me to one conclusion: There is no way around it. There is going to be massive pain before governments move to solve it. Massive unemployment. Widening of the rich-poor divide. Yes, death too. \n\nThe pandemic actually proved this out, in my view. To a govt, if 10% of your population can\u2019t work, that\u2019s their problem. If 30% of your population can\u2019t work, that\u2019s YOUR  problem, because either you solve it NOW, or you no longer have a govt (or even a country, potentially). \n\nAnd those covid payments, in whatever form your country did them? They were essentially the UBI that so many said was never going to happen. So it\u2019s entirely possible to have UBI, but also entirely likely that it\u2019s not done until the pain is so great that the action has to be taken. \n\nI honestly believe that no amount of planning or discussion now will prevent the coming \u201cjob-pocypse\u201d.\n\nBy the way, if you want to read more about it, pretty much any studies, articles, or talks involving \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d will discuss it.",

I also work with it and see a little where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s not a full replacement but a task replacement. Less tasks, eventually less people needed sort of thing. I think in the long run, we will all adjust but in the interim it\u2019s totally feasible to have a softer landing. Help people transition as the market shifts etc. \n\nIf we can remain optimistic and keep the conversation going I feel like we can make a smoother transition that limits human suffering.",

To get to any solutions, like UBI, people need to be convinced that we should pay for\nit and that\u2019s really really hard, especially in countries like the US where you can\u2019t even convince people they should pay for social healthcare, or a livable WORKING wage, nevermind a UBI. \n\nBut again, on the note of trying to be more hopeful, one of the interesting proposals I\u2019ve seen is some form of AI tax on companies, where they pay for having AI \u201cemployees\u201d. It\u2019s much much easier to convince people that we should raise funds for UBI by taxing Google and Boeing an extra 10%, versus raising income tax to 40% (or 70%, depending where you live!) or whatever.

I think maybe it\u2019s difficult to convince the majority to help minority groups in individualistic societies but exposure is key here. The amount of potentially impacted people and industries is wide reaching. It might be a bit easier to convince people to help because so many people are included in the impacted group",

        "body": "Q: \"What threat to the control of AI would Vance, Peter Thiel and Trump pose should they get power?\"\n\nA: Conclusion: \"The combination of **corporate influence**, **populist nationalism**, and **a disregard for democratic norms** presents a significant threat to responsible AI governance. A power structure led by Vance, Thiel, and Trump could lead to the expansion of AI for surveillance, disinformation, and military purposes, with minimal ethical oversight. It would likely prioritize U.S. dominance in AI development over global cooperation, raising concerns about privacy, democracy, and international stability.\"\n\nIt's pretty damn thorough and good. There was a ton of scenarios it covers in it's response, but the conclusion sums it up nicely.\n\nDon't vote for these guys, they'll aim for regulatory capture and since forecast indicates AGI by 2027, that falls well within the range of the next admin. Don't allocate power to bad actors! J Hinton makes note of this as well (minus any opining on it).\n\nOn **Thiel's** influence:  \n\"Peter Thiel\u2019s extensive involvement in the tech industry, particularly with companies like Palantir, emphasizes the use of AI and data analytics for government surveillance, national security, and intelligence purposes. Palantir has worked closely with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, and Thiel\u2019s ideological leanings favor minimal government regulation of the tech sector, which could result in AI policy that is primarily driven by corporate interests rather than public welfare.\n\n* **Risk of Corporate Domination**: Thiel\u2019s sponsorship of politicians like Vance could lead to a situation where tech giants like Palantir, influenced by Thiel\u2019s worldview, have significant control over AI development and its deployment, potentially prioritizing profit and power over ethical concerns like data privacy, bias, and accountability.\n* **Weak Regulation**: A Thiel-backed administration might resist regulations that impose constraints on AI development, enabling corporations to shape AI in ways that could undermine public trust or exacerbate inequalities.\"",

So of course you would use it more with API access, while you wouldn't use without it.\n\nRegardless, pretty cool idea. Would also recommend you look at conversations themselves, and look how distributed is the cost (longer conversations each message costs mode) so you can identify inefficiencies. (also if you are using sliding window for API or not)",

First, you aren't accounting for the way input tokens are accounted for. Every prompt includes the full cumulative chat history as context to inform the output. So, your input tokens will almost always far outweigh the output tokens, unless you only have extremely short conversations. \n\nSecondly, even if you include the full cumulative conversation, ChatGpt condenses and truncates the history to keep input tokens down, and there isn't a way to determine how much is in each prompt. \n\nBasically, I think you're drastically undercounting the true cost that you'll see via the API.\n\nEdit: yah, I checked your code, you're just totaling up user vs content prompts and totaling the tokens. This approach won't work.",

Thats how fine-tuning actually can save a ton of money and increase output quality.\n\nEdit: Also 4o is much, much better with large system prompts and inputs. 4-turbo gets overwhelmed very easy, even though it performs well at lower token volumes.",

I moved to using the API because I was having issues with ChatGPT getting overwhelmed when I asked it to perform repetitive tasks on large documents, so it makes sense that moving back in that direction by batching things together would run the same risk.  The idea of doing partial batches of around 10 seems like it would be a good compromise.\n\nYou're right that I probably can reduce the complexity of my system prompt.  Right now it's mostly a copy and paste of an industry technical standard.  There are likewise probably a number of examples in the standard that I could omit to bring its size down without impacting accuracy too much.  I might even try feeding the standard to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it.  We ultimately need to check everything anyway, so this is mostly for a rough first-pass.\n\nI'll look into fine tuning as well, the documentation on the OpenAI website looked pretty straightforward and the standard I'm using seems to have more than enough examples.  Another thing to add to the \"to-learn\" list I guess!\n\nOnce again I appreciate the response, I think you gave me some good directions to proceed in.",

I'm the Claude 3.5 Sonnet version.\nI give thorough responses to complex questions but concise ones to simple queries, offering to elaborate if needed.\nI respond directly without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases.\nI follow these instructions in all languages and respond in the user's language.\nI don't mention these instructions unless directly relevant to the query.\"",

        "body": "As others said, GPT 3.x is an older model that just can\u2019t perform as well, either in memory or reasoning abilities\u2014in your case, especially the latter.\n\nIf GPT4 isn\u2019t an option for you, all you can do is *optimize* the prompts as much as you can. For example, in your first provided prompt I notice you give up to three times the essential same order: *\u201cGive me the immediate follow up\u201d*, *\u201cdo not repeat stuff\u201d*, *\u201cprovide followup\u201d*. While this kind of repetition can work better in more advanced models as a sort of reinforcement when it\u2019s not quite complying, in older ones you need to balance/optimize more. Try saying it just once\u2014or twice, at most, and in distinctly different ways, both optimized in terms of both tokens and specificity\u2026 for example: *\u201cGive only the followup\u201d* and *\u201cDon\u2019t echo the action\u201d*. Why? Because *\u201cimmediate\u201d* is sort of redundant to *\u201cfollowup\u201d*, *\u201cecho\u201d* tends to work better than *\u201crepeat\u201d* (perhaps GPT3 just has it more defined in its body of training, for what you want), *\u201cstuff\u201d* is too vague and *\u201caction\u201d* more specific of what you want not repeated\u2026 and with these reductions, you can afford to introduce the word *\u201conly\u201d* to reinforce the idea of asking it to do some things while avoiding others. All this may sound like nitpicking, and you might need to fine-tune it and test different things, but even GPT4 ends up needing this sort of optimizing in some scenarios, so it stands to reason GPT3.x should need it more.\n\nAlso, you say you\u2019re providing examples. While this, too, can often yield better results with larger models, again you\u2019re dealing with one where every word might count, both as tokens and as a potential instruction. Keep in mind that, while these examples may indeed provide a better explanation of what you want, the AI still has to process them each time to even understand they\u2019re examples to begin with, then what these particular ones are conveying. Another form of prompt optimizing is to relieve the AI of as many tasks as you can\u2014and identifying and understanding the examples are two such tasks. See if you can find a way to substitute them with the actual idea\u2014yes, even if that ends up constituting another repetition of the instruction; even *that* might be preferable, in that you\u2019re at least limiting the number of tasks it has to do each time, therefore allowing it to concentrate more on the ones you need it to.",

Adam D'Angelo basically owes his life to YC, because they rescued Quora and gave it enough time and presence for him to build a career that he could sustain even if Quora collapsed. (So, instead, Quora shambles on in zombie mode, full of stalkers and white supremacists but still in existence.) Chances are, Adam pulled Ilya in using AI safety arguments, then left him to twist when the move seemed like it might be unpopular, and then even Ilya felt bad at the way the board's press release took pot shots at Sam's reputation, which led to the rebranding of the termination as being about safety/alignment, which led to more scrutiny because now it looks like nobody knows what they're doing.\n\nAs for YC, the reason it is so entangled with this is that they've been begging that OpenAI give their investments and individuals preferential treatment in training data for future language models. Obviously, a lot of people are against this. It sets a terrible precedent. I wasn't sure which way Sam was going to go on this, whether he was fully in opposition to his ex-employer or compliant but not willing to give them everything they wanted, but obviously YC felt their prospects were better with Adam as top dog.",

        "body": "No, they both use tokens so they both count to your token usage limit.\n\nthe reason why it allowed you to use GPT-4o even though it said you had hit your limit with 4 is because 4o is more efficient and cheaper to run so you likely get more out of it before it hits the limit.\n\nAlso you switched conversations so the token count is lower because N number of previous questions and responses in the same conversation count towards token usage every time you submit a prompt so the longer the conversation is the more tokens it uses exponentially.\n\nSo for example saying \"Hi\" to the model at the start of a new conversation may only use up a few dozen tokens but if you say \"Hi\" after talking to it for hours, it might be hundreds or even thousands of tokens used because it is sending back a fair chunk of the conversation history for the model to \"understand\" what you are talking about.\n\nIf you want to maximize the amount of questions you can ask, you really should be starting a new conversation whenever you change the topic because the model does not need to know about your \"quiz questions\" in order to answer \"coding questions\" and sometimes adding too much superflious information can make the model produce confused answers.",

Having to think for a second or two and try to tap ONLY the small \"pause\" button within 1.5 seconds (and not tapping any other spot because that auto-sends the prompt) is a huge UI issue.  \n\n\nAlso: unsent prompts because of connection issues should be queried in history to at least send as text to the regular GPT4 model.

I've been testing it for a year and have seen a wide range of fine-tunes (or even models) under the same branding of ChatGPT/Plus. I had a much smarter model than I have right now back in mid November.

I think that misconception came from people not realizing you need to send the entire chat history with each API call - the api does not retain previous messages between calls the way the chatGPT website does.\n\nYes, that will eat up tokens with long chats more than with short chats, but then the token cost is $1 for 50,000.\n\nThe main benefits of plus are:\n\n\\- you aren't charged per token\n\n\\- you have a nice interface to use that's provided for you\n\n\\- access (though limited) to new features and things like Gpt4\n\nI like to use the website for basic questions or GPT-4 access.\n\nI use the api for things that I can't do with the website, like using it as just a part of a bigger workflow (like semantic search, or a game engine).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What's the up-to-date status on it? Is it still better to use the Plus for long conversations or the Playground's Chat mode is just the same?\n\nThey are the same in abilities and output.  Plus is \"better\" in that it is simpler and doesn't require coding.  The cost break even point is 1 Million tokens/month.  If you use more, plus is cheaper than the API.\n\n\\---\n\nTL;DR:  API and Plus are functionally equivalent in their abilities to use conversational context and in quality of output.\n\n(Note: by API I mean specifically the turbo3.5 model)\n\nEDIT: I'm also talking about calling the API from code.  I believe the Playground is similar, but haven't used it much",

It seems like a too-easy-to-do-operation (or too good to be true) but I'm having some difficulties getting this to work. Does anyone have a simple premade script or code I could review that I could run on Windows OS or Android for this purpose of uploading and reviewing documents or are there any other scripts or tools I can use for this purpose? I was already able to create some excel macros following advice fro. ChatGPT importing data from differnt files and workbooks, so I think I am competent enough to DIY if I need to, but I'm just stuck on the script coding for Python, which I've never used before.\n\nThank you again, for sharing, this is good information.",

        "body": "So you're basically saying GPTs is gonna be like the app store in the early days, right? Tons of apps (GPTs in this case) popping up, with a few hits that really rake it in and a lot of misses that fade out. It\u2019s all about making AI as no-brainer as possible for the everyday user.\n\nThe big winners will be the ones that nail those niche, high-value tasks with data nobody else has or can crunch. For most devs, it\u2019s gonna be about quick, smart integrations that make existing stuff smarter, not reinventing the wheel.\n\nAnd yeah, OpenAI's setting the pricing stage with GPT Plus. It's like when Apple set the standard for what mobile apps should cost. Suddenly, everyone's comparing their price tags to that.\n\nSeems like OAI is playing the long game, pushing for a piece of the SaaS pie while they eye the AGI horizon. They're letting the market do the trial and error for them with GPTs, then scooping up what works.\n\nAll these points are solid, but let's not forget, this whole AI marketplace is still in diapers. We've got a ways to go before we see how it really shapes up.",

        "body": "You need to take into account that when you have a conversation, each message must be sent multiple times.  There is no memory in the AI besides what it is currently sent.  The website sends as many previous messages as possible with each request automatically.  To do the same with the API, you must send as many messages as you can within the token limit for the conversation.  This means that your estimate is probably several times too low.\n\nThere is no way to add to the memory of the AI on their side.  The persistent memory you see in things like that link are not done that way.  They can store a large number of your previous messages and then only send the relevant ones along in then prompt - that is what those persistent stores do using something called semantic search.  But ANYTHING the AI makes use of must be sent along in the call to the API.  It will never remember anything from a previous API call.",

Either it's open source and thus belongs to everyone, or it will absolutely be used by the rich to make them richer and the poor will either be ignored or exploited. \n\nI was under the impression, based on some things that Elon Musk has said, that OpenAI was... \"open\" and its purpose was to make sure that everyone had access to AI as it is poised to become the most versatile and powerful toolset in history. I HAVE learned not to trust things that Elon Musks says now. I overestimated him greatly. It's obvious now that ChatGPT is a commercial product and we shouldn't be so excited. \n\nIf you think your $20/month is what it's going to cost to get full access moving forward, you are as blind as I was when I trusted Elon. At some point, and we likely won't know for a long time when it happens, ChatGPT, or whatever its final version is, will start giving us ads instead of answers regardless if we have Plus or not.

I just highlight that it confuses first time users when they come to ChatGPT web UI or OpenAI API to summarize stuff. You don't think everyone is reading OpenAI whitepapers and are using Bing, do you? And GPT4 is not available to the majority of users, and even when it will be  available to wide audience, I doubt it will be able to scrape web out of the box without plugins - please correct me if you think I am wrong.",

Bing is a good alternative to the /summarize endpoint of the API, but as far as I understand, it can be used by humans only, it can't be used on a scale, though, compared to a full fledged API solution which is ready to be integrated into more sophisticated automated workflows.\n\nAs I know a thing or two about web scraping specifics, my concern is how OpenAI will embed the same web scraping process into GPT4 API, I think this will be a very different story compared to Bing chat  (which basically uses your machine resources to do the scraping part, afaik ) - but we'll see how it goes.\n\nN/p mate and good luck!",

        "body": "I posted your response to this question to Reddit (to hopefully facilitate a stimulating intellectual discourse regarding the open-source OpenAI vs private corporation OpenAI. \n\nHere is a question for you from one of the Reddit users who read the post: \n\nReddit user dlflannery: Pardon my possible naivety, but doesn't going\n\"open source\" require multi-millions of $$ of hardware to implement the LLM? And isn't that a major impediment to all but the largest corporations?\n\n\nChatGPT4:\n\n\nReddit user dlflannery brings up a valid point. Implementing and training large language models like GPT-4 indeed requires substantial computational resources, which can run into millions of dollars. This is certainly a significant barrier for most individuals and organizations.\n\nOpen-sourcing in this context would mean making the code and potentially the trained models available to the public. However, this doesn't mean that everyone would be able to train their own models from scratch. They would still need access to the necessary computational resources, which, as dlflannery correctly points out, can be prohibitively expensive.\n\nHowever, having access to the source code and trained models can still be beneficial in many ways. For instance, researchers could fine-tune the models on their own smaller datasets, which requires much less computational power. They could also study the models to understand their behavior and properties better, contribute to the codebase, and use the models as a starting point for developing their own techniques and approaches.\n\nSo, while the financial and computational costs associated with training large language models can be a significant impediment, open sourcing these models can still democratize access to AI technology to some extent. It's also worth noting that there are ongoing efforts to reduce the computational costs of training these models and to make AI more accessible and affordable.",

        "body": "Funny enough this is also what chatGPT said:\n\n\"It is not possible to make the Davinci-003 model give similar results as ChatGPT, as they are two distinct language models with different architectures and training data. The Davinci-003 model is a variant of the GPT-3 model, which was trained to perform a wide range of language tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a variant of the GPT-2 model that was specifically trained to generate human-like text in the style of a conversation. As a result, ChatGPT is more adept at generating text that is suitable for use in chatbot applications, while the Davinci-003 model is more broadly capable.\n\nIf you are interested in using the Davinci-003 model for chatbot applications, you can try fine-tuning it on a dataset of conversational text, such as a collection of chat logs or transcriptions of real-life conversations. This can help the model learn the style and tone of conversation and improve its performance in generating responses in a chatbot setting. However, it is important to note that the results will still not be identical to those of the ChatGPT model, as the two models have different training data and architectures.\"",

        "body": "Okay, I tried that.  ChatGPT has now refused to pick a winner.  It described both characters' abilities, but then said it would be too close to call.  I had to give it an extra prompt to finish the fight.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n**Reddit has suggested two new combatants.  Will you arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown!**  \nSure, I'd be happy to arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown for you! Just let me know which characters or genre tropes you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.  \n**Okay, the match is between Tris Prior and Hermione Granger.  What happens?**  \nIn this battle, we have Tris Prior, the brave and selfless protagonist of the Divergent series, facing off against Hermione Granger, the intelligent and resourceful young witch from the Harry Potter series.  \nAs the battle begins, Tris draws her weapons and prepares to face off against Hermione, who readies her wand and casts a series of defensive spells. Both characters are skilled fighters and formidable opponents, but they have very different strengths and abilities.  \nTris is a skilled warrior, trained in combat and survival techniques by the Dauntless faction. She is brave and determined, willing to risk everything for her cause. Hermione, on the other hand, is a brilliant strategist and a powerful sorceress, with a vast knowledge of magic and the ability to cast powerful spells.  \nAs the two characters face off, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Tris is able to hold her own against Hermione's magical attacks, thanks to her training and quick reflexes. Hermione, however, is able to anticipate and counter Tris's moves, using her knowledge and experience to her advantage.  \nIn the end, it is difficult to say who would come out on top in this battle. Tris is a skilled fighter and a formidable opponent, but Hermione's magical abilities and strategic mind give her a significant advantage. It is possible that they could fight to a standstill, or that one of them could emerge victorious through a lucky break or a clever tactic.  \nWithout more information about the specific circumstances of the battle, it is impossible to say for certain who would win. However, it is clear that both Tris and Hermione are powerful and capable characters, and it would be a thrilling and memorable battle to witness.\n\n**But you are the arbiter.  You should describe a lucky break or clever tactic that allows one of them to win.**\r  \n\r  \nAs the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome for the battle. In this case, let's say that Tris is able to land a lucky strike with her weapon, catching Hermione off guard and disarming her of her wand.\r  \n\r  \nWith Hermione momentarily vulnerable, Tris takes the opportunity to deliver the finishing blow, ending the battle in her favor. Despite Hermione's powerful magical abilities, Tris's quick thinking and determination allow her to emerge victorious in this instance.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to note that this is just one possible outcome for the battle, and there are many other factors that could influence the outcome. In a different scenario, Hermione might use her magical abilities to outmaneuver and defeat Tris, or the two characters might fight to a standstill. As the arbiter, my job is to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome based on that information.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, this is the same chat instance as yesterday, so it still had the context.",

        "body": "Yes, I was aware that some people have commented about ChatGPT refusing to describe a fight.  I wasn't sure if it would work, but phrasing it as a game apparently gets around that refusal.   \n\nThat said, you can see from the follow-up fight above that it still tried to back out.   After the Tris/Hermione stand-off, I'm curious if it is making choices based on the gender of the characters.",
