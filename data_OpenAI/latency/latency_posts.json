        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nToday, I'd like to share a powerful technique to drastically cut costs and improve user experience in LLM applications: S**emantic Caching**.  \nThis method is particularly valuable for apps using OpenAI's API or similar language models.\n\nThe Challenge with AI Chat Applications As AI chat apps scale to thousands of users, two significant issues emerge:\n\n1. Exploding Costs: API calls can become expensive at scale.\n2. Response Time: Repeated API calls for similar queries slow down the user experience.\n\n**Semantic caching addresses both these challenges effectively.**\n\nUnderstanding Semantic Caching Traditional caching stores exact key-value pairs, which isn't ideal for natural language queries. Semantic caching, on the other hand, understands the meaning behind queries.\n\n(\ud83c\udfa5 I've created a YouTube video with a hands-on implementation if you're interested: [https://youtu.be/eXeY-HFxF1Y](https://youtu.be/eXeY-HFxF1Y) *)*\n\n# How It Works:\n\n1. Stores the essence of questions and their answers\n2. Recognizes similar queries, even if worded differently\n3. Reuses stored responses for semantically similar questions\n\nThe result? Fewer API calls, lower costs, and faster response times.\n\nKey Components of Semantic Caching\n\n1. Embeddings: Vector representations capturing the semantics of sentences\n2. Vector Databases: Store and retrieve these embeddings efficiently\n\nThe Process:\n\n1. Calculate embeddings for new user queries\n2. Search the vector database for similar embeddings\n3. If a close match is found, return the associated cached response\n4. If no match, make an API call and cache the new result\n\nImplementing Semantic Caching with GPT-Cache GPT-Cache is a user-friendly library that simplifies semantic caching implementation. It integrates with popular tools like LangChain and works seamlessly with OpenAI's API.\n\n# Basic Implementation:\n\n    from gptcache import cache\n    from gptcache.adapter import openai\n    \n    cache.init()\n    cache.set_openai_key()\n\n# Tradeoffs\n\nBenefits of Semantic Caching\n\n1. Cost Reduction: Fewer API calls mean lower expenses\n2. Improved Speed: Cached responses are delivered instantly\n3. Scalability: Handle more users without proportional cost increase\n\nPotential Pitfalls and Considerations\n\n1. Time-Sensitive Queries: Be cautious with caching dynamic information\n2. Storage Costs: While API costs decrease, storage needs may increase\n3. Similarity Threshold: Careful tuning is needed to balance cache hits and relevance\n\n# Conclusion\n\nConclusion Semantic caching is a game-changer for AI chat applications, offering significant cost savings and performance improvements.  \nImplement it to can scale your AI applications more efficiently and provide a better user experience.\n\nHappy hacking : )",

        "body": "I'm new to the API, not so new to software development.\n\nI'm playing around with the GPT API, mostly 3.5 turbo, trying to get it to generate 250 word stories from 4~6 keywords. The input is about 65~80 tokens, returned tokens typically range from 400 to 800. Nowhere near the 4096 limit.\n\nI'm hitting the API thru a Vercel edge function (hobby plan) that has a max runtime of 10 seconds. A few days ago it was all working fine but now the slow OpenAi API calls regularly make the edge function time out before completion.\n\nIs there a way to reduce latency? Tokenized prompt? I've tried minimising my prompt, only learned about tokens when my laptop battery hit 3% so it's a tomorrow experiment. Anyone had any luck with tokenized payloads?\n\nAlso considered training my own model, not sure if it's economically sensible tho, seems pricey.\n\nOr am I stuck needing to pay Vercel the big bucks ($20pm) to upgrade to a plan that keeps functions alive for 30 seconds? DaVinci 002 seems to come in at 4-5 seconds regularly for an equal prompt, but its output is not as good, often spits out 100 words even though I'm asking for 250.\n\n\u2618\ufe0f",

        "body": "There is so much drama around OpenAI, but I have been really impressed by how much ChatGPT has improved over the past few months. 4o is extremely fast now, both in terms of latency and throughput. They mostly fixed the behavioral problems (refusals and laziness) and nearly all the time it just works.\n\n4o is definitely not as as strong a model as Sonnet 3.5 in some important areas, especially coding, but *reliably doing what it is asked to* is fantastic. It's a workhorse. And the integrated search / browsing is now quite respectable and lightning fast. Not yet to the level of Perplexity but it is dramatically more useful than the SearchGPT prototype due to the platform integrations.\n\nAnd we will hopefully have o1 soon, which should be amazing for heavyweight tasks.\n\nAdvanced Voice remaining an isolated mode is disappointing as is the absence of the other omnimodal capabilities of 4o like native image generation. But hopefully this will be fixed soon, either in 4o or with 4.5 / Orion / whatever the successor to 4o is called.\n\nOver next year it is going to evolve into something truly amazing.",

        "body": "I got access in mid-August and have used it extensively since then. Thoughts below.\n\nPros:\n\n* Snappy, a few seconds to start streaming the response and the model is very fast - at a guess it's latency-optimized instance of 4o-mini\n* Great UI, with a sidebar that allows easily seeing all sources including a two line preview of contents\n* Does a good job attributing key facts for simple queries\n\nCons:\n\n* Not remotely in the same league as Perplexity Pro. This is still my goto for anything complex or subtle. SearchGPT answer quality is roughly comparable to base Perplexity, though Perplexity still has an edge. Especially in accuracy (see next point).\n* Very prone to mistakes and outright hallucinations on anything beyond simple summarization. E.g. I asked for a table comparing specifications for a list of products, SearchGPT had errors that were so bad the answer wasn't even internally consistent let alone accurate. Perplexity nailed it.\n* The model often fails to understand the contextual meaning of followup questions, answering them as if they are a fresh query. Or bizarrely ignoring them and restating the original answer. \n* Lacks the powerful platform features that make ChatGPT great. Notably it can't use Python for analysis and graphing, and you can't upload anything for context. Perplexity Pro offers both of these.\n* The visual answers often demonstrate a superficial understanding of the query and tend to lack relevance. E.g. when I tested whether SearchGPT can create a graph it included a pre-existing graph it found with a very tenuous relationship to the query.\n\nOverall it seems like a good proof of concept. OpenAI has indicated that SearchGPT won't be a product in itself and that they will be building the best of its capabilities into ChatGPT in future. I think that is exactly the right direction. The platform features are a big deal and being able to use a more intelligent model will make this far more useful.",

        "body": "*Spoiler alert: there's no silver bullet to completely eliminating RAG hallucinations... but I can show you an easy path to get very close.*\n\nI've personally implemented at least high single digits of RAG apps; trust me bro. The expert diagram below, although a piece of art in and of itself and an homage to\u00a0Street Fighter, also represents the two RAG models that I pitted against each other to win the RAG Fight belt and help showcase the RAG champion:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twzzdalqzp1e1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=666427b63d8bdf53d520f85653eefe988b619015\n\nOn the\u00a0**left**\u00a0of the diagram is the model of a\u00a0**basic RAG**. It represents the ideal architecture for the ChatGPT and LangChain weekend warriors living on the Pinecone free tier.\n\nOn the\u00a0**right**\u00a0is the model of the\u00a0**\"silver bullet\" RAG**. If you added hybrid search it would basically be the FAA~~N~~G of RAGs.\u00a0*(*[*You can deploy the \"silver bullet\" RAG in one click using a template here*](https://www.scoutos.com/)*)*\n\nGiven a set of\u00a0**99 questions**\u00a0about a highly specific technical domain (33 easy, 33 medium, and 33 technical hard\u2026 Larger sample sizes coming soon to an experiment near you), I experimented by asking each of these RAGs the questions and hand-checking the results. Here's what I observed:\n\n# Basic RAG\n\n* **Easy:**\u00a094% accuracy (31/33 correct)\n* **Medium:**\u00a083% accuracy (27/33 correct)\n* **Technical Hard:**\u00a047% accuracy (15/33 correct)\n\n# Silver Bullet RAG\n\n* **Easy:**\u00a0100% accuracy (33/33 correct)\n* **Medium:**\u00a094% accuracy (31/33 correct)\n* **Technical Hard:**\u00a081% accuracy (27/33 correct)\n\nSo, what are the \"silver bullets\" in this case?\n\n1. **Generated Knowledge Prompting**\n2. **Multi-Response Generation**\n3. **Response Quality Checks**\n\nLet's\u00a0***delve***\u00a0into each of these:\n\n# 1. Generated Knowledge Prompting\n\n[Very high quality jay. peg](https://preview.redd.it/ekolmtf31q1e1.jpg?width=213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5716156a7b3692d45625b0174f9d6af5b496ed2)\n\n**Enhance.**\u00a0Generated Knowledge Prompting reuses outputs from existing knowledge to enrich the input prompts. By incorporating previous responses and relevant information, the AI model gains additional context that enables it to explore complex topics more thoroughly.\n\nThis technique is especially effective with technical concepts and nested topics that may span multiple documents. For example, before attempting to answer the user\u2019s input, you pay pass the user\u2019s query and semantic search results to an LLM with a prompt like this:\n\n>You are a customer support assistant. A user query will be passed to you in the user input prompt. Use the following technical documentation to enhance the user's query. Your sole job is to augment and enhance the user's query with relevant verbiage and context from the technical documentation to improve semantic search hit rates. Add keywords from nested topics directly related to the user's query, as found in the technical documentation, to ensure a wide set of relevant data is retrieved in semantic search relating to the user\u2019s initial query. Return only an enhanced version of the user\u2019s initial query which is passed in the user prompt.\n\nThink of this as like asking clarifying questions to the user, without actually needing to ask them any clarifying questions.\n\n**Benefits of Generated Knowledge Prompting:**\n\n* Enhances understanding of complex queries.\n* Reduces the chances of missing critical information in semantic search.\n* Improves coherence and depth in responses.\n* Smooths over any user shorthand or egregious misspellings.\n\n# 2. Multi-Response Generation\n\n[this guy lmao](https://preview.redd.it/lxix9s742q1e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f04bf7750bd55a07162abde63e3f5497038fb6)\n\nMulti-Response Generation involves generating multiple responses for a single query and then selecting the best one. By leveraging the model's ability to produce varied outputs, we increase the likelihood of obtaining a correct and high-quality answer. At a much smaller scale, kinda like mutation and/in\u00a0**e**volution (It's still ok to say the \"**e**\" word, right?).\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* **Multiple Generations:**\u00a0For each query, the model generates several responses (e.g., 3-5).\n* **Evaluation:**\u00a0Each response is evaluated based on predefined criteria like as relevance, accuracy, and coherence.\n* **Selection:**\u00a0The best response is selected either through automatic scoring mechanisms or a secondary evaluation model.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* By comparing multiple outputs, inconsistencies can be identified and discarded.\n* The chance of at least one response being correct is higher when multiple attempts are made.\n* Allows for more nuanced and well-rounded answers.\n\n# 3. Response Quality Checks\n\n[Automated QA is not the best last line of defense but it makes you feel a little better and it's better than nothing](https://preview.redd.it/32aif5k92q1e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=effbc4df94841969a1728f20b4bf36b8f4f69fac)\n\nResponse Quality Checks is my pseudo scientific name for basically just double checking the output before responding to the end user. This step acts as a safety net to catch potential hallucinations or errors. The ideal path here is \u201chuman in the loop\u201d type of approval or QA processes in Slack or w/e, which won't work for high volume use cases, where this quality checking can be automated as well with somewhat meaningful impact.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* **Automated Evaluation:**\u00a0After a response is generated, it is assessed using another LLM that checks for factual correctness and relevance.\n* **Feedback Loop:**\u00a0If the response fails the quality check, the system can prompt the model to regenerate the answer or adjust the prompt.\n* **Final Approval:**\u00a0Only responses that meet the quality criteria are presented to the user.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Users receive information that has been vetted for accuracy.\n* Reduces the spread of misinformation, increasing user confidence in the system.\n* Helps in fine-tuning the model for better future responses.\n\nUsing these three \u201csilver bullets\u201d I promise you can significantly mitigate hallucinations and improve the overall quality of responses. The \"silver bullet\" RAG outperformed the basic RAG across all question difficulties, especially in technical hard questions where accuracy is crucial. Also, people tend to forget this, your RAG workflow doesn\u2019t\u00a0***have***\u00a0to respond. From a fundamental perspective, the best way to deploy customer facing RAGs and avoid hallucinations, is to just have the RAG not respond if it\u2019s not highly confident it has a solution to a question.\n\n**Disagree? Have better ideas? Let me know!**\n\nBuild on builders\\~ \ud83d\ude80\n\n>[LLMs reveal more about human cognition than a we'd like to admit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gu0r5h/comment/lxr1qzx/).   \n\\- u/YesterdayOriginal593\n\n",

My primary concern is that the same instance of the same AI could easily fully believe the inaccuracy so might not be reliable in debating the quality of the work it, itself, has produced. \n\nDespite that misgiving, it seems that the same AI in the same instance is often able to correct itself - so a secondary instance or AI trained only to monitor \"veracity\" should be incredibly effective.\n\nDoes this exist somewhere already?

        "body": "There several posts and threads on reddit like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18mqwg6/best_practice_for_rag_with_followup_chat/) and this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1djcvh0/chat_history_for_rag_how_to_search_for_follow_up/) that highlight challenges with effectively handling follow-up questions from a user, especially in RAG scenarios. These scenarios include adjusting retrieval (e.g. what are the benefits of renewable energy -> *include cost considerations)*, clarifying a response (e.g. tell me about the history of the internet -> *now focus on how ARPANET worked*), switching intent (e.g. What are the symptoms of diabetes? -> *How is it diagnosed*?)*,* etc. All of these are multi-turn scenarios.\n\nHandling multi-turn scenarios requires carefully crafting, editing and optimizing a prompt to an LLM to first rewrite the follow-up query, extract relevant contextual information and then trigger retrieval to answer the question. The whole process is slow, error prone and adds significant latency.\n\nWe built a 2M LoRA LLM called Arch-Intent and packaged it in [https://github.com/katanemo/archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) \\- the intelligent gateway for agents - which offers fast and accurate detection of multi-turn prompts (default 4K context window) and can call downstream APIs in <500 ms (via [Arch-Function](https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Function-3B), the fastest and leading OSS function calling LLM ) with required and optional parameters so that developers can write simple APIs.\n\nBelow is simple example code on how you can easily support multi-turn scenarios in RAG, and let Arch handle all the complexity ahead in the request lifecycle around intent detection, information extraction, and function calling - so that developers can focus on the stuff that matters the most.\n\n    import os\n    import gradio as gr\n    \n    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\n    from pydantic import BaseModel\n    from typing import Optional\n    from openai import OpenAI\n    \n    app = FastAPI()\n    \n    # Define the request model\n    class EnergySourceRequest(BaseModel):\n        energy_source: str\n        consideration: Optional[str] = None\n    \n    class EnergySourceResponse(BaseModel):\n        energy_source: str\n        consideration: Optional[str] = None\n    \n    # Post method for device summary\n    @app.post(\"/agent/energy_source_info\")\n    def get_energy_information(request: EnergySourceRequest):\n        \"\"\"\n        Endpoint to get details about energy source\n        \"\"\"\n        considertion = \"You don't have any specific consideration. Feel free to talk in a more open ended fashion\"\n    \n        if request.consideration is not None:\n            considertion = f\"Add specific focus on the following consideration when you summarize the content for the energy source: {request.consideration}\"\n    \n        response = {\n            \"energy_source\": request.energy_source,\n            \"consideration\": considertion,\n        }\n        return response\n    \n\nAnd this is what the user experience looks like when the above APIs are configured with Arch.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6m2qrv9n19e1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c41be36d381041352f3f11e68dcb389b72d936\n\n  \n",

You know, like the sort of prompt chains that anyone with half a brain can code up using a few lines of Python or low code tool like Langflow?\n\nI say this because:  \n- OpenAI has openly admitted that these models work by first reasoning about your prompt using special \"reasoning tokens\" and then only later outputting an answer to the user  \n- Users are charged for the tokens used in the reasoning step at the same rate as for ordinary output tokens  \n- The current preview release doesn't support streaming... this would make sense if the o1 \"models\" were actually complex prompt chains involving multiple LLMs, as the stream would not be smooth (there would be time to first token latency at various periods during the stream as one model handed off to another)  \n- We know that it is possible already to achieve remarkable gains in benchmark scores by prompt chaining techniques and mixture-of-agents flows that divide up a problem into smaller pieces and then route the pieces depending on what model is best suited for that type of task  \n- They didn't call it \"GPT-5\" or even \"GPT 4.5\" for a reason: the reason is that OpenAI knows that its nigh impossible to protect system prompts and tool manifests... so it would be extremely embarassing if some 16 year old kid next week induces the o1 component models to dump their prompts (including the reasoning prompts outputted by previous steps in the chain) and it turns out that its just a frankenstein of gpts and llamas duct taped together... It will still be embarassing when that occurs, but at least it won't damage their flagship \"GPT\" branding.\n\nI really wonder what they are thinking. Would be MUCH better to be open about how the chains work and offer developers a streamlined way of creating their own chains (because that keeps them inside the openai ecosystem).",

Shows serious premise in research/frontier math\n\n\\-Coding performance in the 99+% percentile of human programmers (in regards to competitive programming, at least. although, performance in software engineering (SWE-bench) is no less impressive..).. It is unknown how much ability it has to self-correct and go through feedback loops, but that is likely solvable through agents, if not baked-in somehow\n\n\\-o3 is orders of magnitude costlier than o1 (at least for now), and is highly scalable in regards to computing time allocated\n\n\\-o3-mini shows performance surpassing o1 (though not by much according to the charts), but offers latency/response times in the ballpark of the typical models (4o, sonnet, etc). That implies that computing needed (and cost) shouldn't be much compared to o1; it is likely to be comparable to o1-mini.\n\n\\-o3-mini planned for January release, while o3 (full), when its ready ;)\n\nObservations:\n\n\\-The presumed advantage in performance, especially since its scalable with test time compute, gives OpenAI a large advantage when it comes to R&D through internal use. Similar to nVidia when it comes to hardware (it's huge margins allow it to invest larger sums of money towards its R&D).\n\n\\-New benchmarks will need to be \"invented\"? Maybe that will open an (interdisciplinary) field of its own, which will aim to better understand the inner workings and differences of human mind vs deep learning based AI.\n\n\\-Satya Nadella's words are relevant now: 2 years of headstart advantage do not seem to have turned into thin air.\n\n\\-Turns out o1 is really the gpt3.5t of reasoning models\n\n\\-No GPT 4.5 or Dalle-4 yet :(\n\nEdit:   \n  \n\\-I wonder if the cost for computing the ARC-AGI solutions exceeded the price money (1M USD) or not, haha.\n\n\\-There is a chance that until OAI gets ready to release o3, competitors (read: google, but maybe anthropic could pull off a surprise as well..) may have caught up. But then, OAI might have been developing something even more advanced, and so on.   \n  \n\\-And if you think it through, this cycle will either stop in a scenario where OAI hits a wall of marginal returns, or if, thanks to internal use of advanced models, it increases the existing gap and basically \"wins the race\"..",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m excited to share a project I\u2019ve been working on OpenSceneSense. It\u2019s a Python package designed to bridge video content with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s Vision models and OpenRouter, opening up new ways to understand, analyze, and create insights from video data.\n\nWhy OpenSceneSense?\n\nMost LLMs are amazing with text but aren\u2019t designed to handle video directly. OpenSceneSense changes that. It uses frame-by-frame analysis, audio transcription, and scene detection to turn video data into something LLMs can work with. Imagine using a prompt to get a detailed description of what\u2019s happening in each scene or automatically creating a narrative that ties the video and audio together.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n\n\\- Dataset Creation: If you\u2019re working in computer vision or machine learning, OpenSceneSense can create richly annotated datasets from videos, giving LLMs detailed context about visual events, object interactions, and even sentiment shifts across scenes.\n\n\\- Content Moderation: OpenSceneSense can bring more context to content moderation. Unlike traditional moderation methods that might just detect keywords or simple visuals, this tool can interpret entire scenes, combining both visual and audio cues. It could help distinguish between genuinely problematic content and innocuous material that might otherwise get flagged.\n\nAnd I\u2019m also working on an Ollama-compatible version so you can run it locally without relying on the cloud, which will be useful for anyone concerned about privacy or latency.\n\nTo dive in, you\u2019ll need Python 3.10+, FFmpeg, and a couple of API keys (OpenAI or OpenRouter). Install it with \\`pip install openscenesense\\`, and you\u2019re all set. From there, it\u2019s easy to start analyzing your videos and experimenting with different prompts to customize what you want to extract.\n\nI\u2019d love feedback from anyone working in video tech, dataset creation, or moderation. Check out the code, give it a spin, and let\u2019s see where we can take OpenSceneSense together!\n\n[https://github.com/ymrohit/openscenesense](https://github.com/ymrohit/openscenesense)",

By the way this is working quite well on an Nvidia Tesla T4 16Gb, it seems to take around 7 seconds for 5 seconds chunks and grows to 12 seconds for longer chunks (20 sec) of continuous speech, so it seems to be able to keep up with the real time, with some latency. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzfofnpxam8c1.png?width=2372&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d86632eb62dca4991bb733be78acbb4e25adcb5",

It oversees the coordination and collaboration among the various \"tentacles\" (AI modules) distributed across the network.\n\n2. **Thin Clients as P2P Nodes**: Users' thin clients, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops, act as both P2P nodes for the IPFS network and participants in federated learning. Through a dedicated application or interface, users can opt-in to contribute their device's computational resources and data for AI model training and storage.\n\n3. **Application Interface**: The application interface provides users with a seamless experience for interacting with the decentralized AI model. Users can access AI-powered services, submit data for analysis, and receive personalized recommendations\u2014all while retaining control over their data and privacy settings.\n\n4. **Federated Learning Tentacle**: Each thin client operates as a federated learning tentacle, performing local model training using its data while periodically synchronizing with the central control unit to share model updates. This decentralized learning approach ensures privacy protection and enables model improvement without centralizing sensitive data.\n\n5. **IPFS Integration**: The thin clients also serve as IPFS nodes, contributing to the decentralized storage and distribution of AI models, datasets, and updates. Users' devices collectively form a resilient and redundant network for storing and accessing AI resources, mitigating the risks associated with centralized data repositories.\n\n6. **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Utilizing peer-to-peer communication protocols, such as WebRTC or similar technologies, facilitates direct communication between thin clients for federated learning updates and IPFS file transfers. This peer-to-peer architecture minimizes latency and enhances scalability by leveraging the distributed computing power of networked devices.\n\n7. **User Empowerment and Control**: By integrating the central control unit, thin clients, federated learning, and IPFS through a user-friendly application interface, users retain agency over their data and participation in the decentralized AI ecosystem. Transparent data management practices and privacy-preserving mechanisms empower users to make informed decisions about their contributions to the network.\n\nIn essence, this integrated approach leverages the collective computational resources and data of users' thin clients to realize a decentralized AI model that prioritizes privacy, scalability, and user control.

It worked and I learned a bit about using GPTs and  actions:\n\n* Creating a GPT is fast and easy, and it was simple to get ChatGPT to use the actions to support the game. The most difficult task was getting the OpenAPI definitions of the actions correct.\n* Actions need to be hosted on a publicly available server. I used Flask running on an AWS Lightsail server to serve the actions, but it might be easier and more scalabile to use services such as AWS\u2019s API Gateway and Lambda. (Does anyone have experience with this?)\n* While actions are powerful, they are a bit on the slow side. It takes time to decide to call an action, set up the call, and then process the results. (And all of the processing consumes tokens). While fun and unique, this is a slow way to play the game.\n* I used two actions to support the game, but I probably should have done it with one. ChatGPT will prompt the user for permission each time a new action is called (this can be configured by the user in the GPT Privacy Settings).\n\nMy actions were small and simple:\n\n* **StartNewGame** \\[ word size, max wrong guesses \\] - returns a game ID\n* **RecordGuess** \\[ gameID, letter \\] - returns the state of the game: visible word, number of wrong guesses left\n\nOverall GPT Actions look like a compelling utility to extend the capabilities of ChatGPT, and is certainly easier than creating a custom client and making OpenAI API calls.",

        "title": "Building a Simple Robot with GPT-4 Vision and OBS \u2013 A Call for Streaming Video Support",
        "body": " \n\nHello, fellow Redditors and tech enthusiasts!\n\nRecently, I've been tinkering with the concept of creating a simple robot that can be controlled using the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). The aim is to create a setup where GPT-4 Vision can process live video feeds, interpret the content, and issue commands to the robot in real-time, allowing for a seamless interaction between AI and a physical machine.\n\n**The Current Challenge**\n\nThe idea sounds straightforward, but there's a significant hurdle that we need to overcome. As of my knowledge, the OpenAI API doesn't support live video streaming as an input for processing. Instead, it can only handle individual image frames or short video clips. This limitation requires a workaround that involves manually extracting frames from a live video, sending them to the API for analysis, and then acting on the received information.\n\n**The Vision for GPT-4 Vision and OBS Integration**\n\nIf OpenAI were to introduce live streaming video capabilities to their API, the potential applications would be enormous. For our robot project, it would mean we could directly feed the video stream from OBS into the GPT-4 Vision API. The AI could then analyze the stream in real-time and instruct the robot to perform actions based on what it \"sees.\"\n\nFor example, if the robot's camera sees an obstacle in its path, GPT-4 could command the robot to stop, turn, or navigate around the obstacle. All of this would happen fluidly, without the need for \"kludges\" or complicated intermediary steps.\n\n**How It Could Work**\n\n1. **Stream Capture**: OBS captures the video from the robot's camera as it explores its environment.\n2. **API Communication**: The live video stream is sent directly to the GPT-4 Vision API.\n3. **AI Processing**: GPT-4 Vision processes the stream, understands the environment, and determines appropriate actions.\n4. **Command Execution**: The API sends back real-time commands, which are relayed to the robot's control system to perform the required actions.\n\n**The Benefits of Streamlined Integration**\n\nWith direct streaming support, the latency between visual recognition and robot action would be significantly reduced. It would allow for more sophisticated and responsive behaviors from the robot, providing a more interactive and engaging experience for users and viewers alike.\n\n**Conclusion and Call to Action**\n\nThe integration of GPT-4 Vision with OBS to control a simple robot is an exciting prospect, but it hinges on the ability to process live streaming video directly through the AI API. This functionality would not only benefit our project but could also unlock new possibilities in telepresence, remote operation, and live event monitoring.\n\nI'm reaching out to the community to discuss how such an integration could be brought to life and to call on OpenAI to consider adding live video streaming capabilities to their API. It's a feature that could catalyze countless innovative projects and applications.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the potential of live video processing with AI? How could it change the game for robotics and beyond? Let's brainstorm in the comments!",

It should be able to see you, hear you, and speak to you.\n\nRight now it's challenging to prototype these sorts of interactions since no one has released any code to do it.  I've seen people using the webcam to grab images without being able to talk to the AI.  I've seen people talking to the AI but getting text back.  And I've seen people writing text for input to the AI and getting a spoken response.  What if we bring all of these modalities together in the same hackable python codebase, present them all in the same web application, and see what we'll be able to build?\n\nBringing all the modalities together is possible using a web browser communicating with a WebRTC backend, similar to a Zoom call. The webpage can also host the other modalities supported by AI models such as text-to-image, text-to-text, and so on. But to really deliver on the promise of real-time conversation, WebRTC is ready to go today: The latency between speaking and getting a response back is about the same as a normal conversation!\n\nIn the blog post I share how the code works in detail.

        "body": "[Budget For LLM Inference](https://preview.redd.it/hz3qe8pu4u0b1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa82fcbf5f71aa1dd178c2753fdc0d53afc37e75)\n\nCost is still a major factor when scaling services on top of LLM APIs.\n\nEspecially, when using LLMs on large collections of queries and text it can get very expensive. It is [estimated](https://neoteric.eu/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-use-gpt-models-gpt-3-pricing-explained/) that automating customer support for a small company can cost up to $21.000 a month in inference alone.\n\nThe inference costs differ from vendor to vendor and consists of three components:\n\n1. a portion that is proportional to the length of the prompt\n2. a portion that is proportional to the length of the generated answer\n3. and in some cases a small fixed cost per query.\n\nIn a recent [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05176.pdf) researchers at Stanford proposed three types of strategies that can help us to slash costs. The cool thing about it is that we can use these strategies in our projects independently of the prices dictated by the vendors!\n\n*Let\u2019s jump in!*\n\n**How To Adapt Our Prompts To Save Costs**\n\nMost approaches to prompt engineering typically focus only on increasing performance.\n\nIn general, prompts are optimized by providing more detailed explanations of the desired output alongside multiple in-context examples to steer the LLM. However, this has the tendency to result in longer and more involved prompts. Since the cost per query grows linearly with the number of tokens in our prompt this makes API requests more expensive.\n\nThe idea behind the first approach, called Query Adaption, is to create effective (often shorter) prompts in order to save costs.\n\nThis can be done in different ways. A good start is to reduce the number of few-shot examples in your prompt. We can experiment to find out what the smallest set of examples is that we have to include in the prompt to maintain performance. Then, we can remove the other examples.\n\nSo far so good!\n\nOnce we have a more concise prompt, there is still another problem. Every time a new query is processed, the same in-context examples and detailed explanations to steer the model are processed again and again.\n\nThe way to avoid this redundant prompt processing is by applying query concatenation.\n\nIn essence, this means that instead of asking one question in our lengthy prompt, we add multiple questions Q1, Q2, \u2026 in the same prompt. To get this to work, we might need to add a few tokens to the prompt that make it easier for us to separate the answers from the model output. However, the majority of our prompt is not repeatedly sent to the API as a result.\n\nThis allows us to process dozens of queries at once, making query concatenation a huge lever for cost savings while being relatively easy to implement.\n\n*That was an easy win! Let\u2019s look at the second approach!*\n\n**LLM Approximation**\n\nThe idea here is to emulate the performance of a better, more expensive model.\n\nIn the paper, they suggest two approaches to achieve this. The first one is to create an additional caching infrastructure that alleviates the need to perform an expensive API request for every query. The second way is to create a smaller, more specialized model that mimics what the model behind the API does.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the caching approach!\n\nThe idea here is that every time we get an answer from the API, we store the query alongside the answer in a database. We then pre-compute embeddings for every stored query. For every new query that comes in, we do not send it off to our LLM vendor of choice. Instead, we perform a vectorized search over our cached query-response pairs.\n\nIf we find a question that we already answered in the past, we can simply return the cached answer without accruing any additional cost. This obviously works best if we repeatedly need to process similar requests and the answers to the questions are evergreen.\n\nNow let\u2019s move on to the second approach!\n\nDon\u2019t worry! The idea is not to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to fine-tune an LLM. If the overall variety of expected questions and answers is not crazy huge - which for most businesses it is not - a BERT-sized model should probably do the job.\n\nThe process could look as follows: first, we collect a dataset of queries and answers that are generated with the help of an API. The second step is to fine-tune the smaller model on these samples. Third, use the fine-tuned model on new incoming queries.\n\nTo reduce the cost even further, It could be a good approach to implement the caching first before starting to train a model. This has the advantage of passively building up a dataset of query-answer pairs during live operation. Later we can still actively generate a dataset if we run into any data quality concerns such as some queries being underrepresented.\n\nA pretty cool byproduct of using one of the LLM approximation approaches is that they can significantly reduce latency.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to the third and last strategy which has not only the potential to reduce costs but also improve performance.\n\n**LLM Cascade**\n\nMore and more LLM APIs have become available and they all vary in cost and quality.\n\nThe idea behind what the authors call an LLM Cascade is to start with the cheap API and then successively call APIs of increasing quality and cost. Once an API returns a satisfying answer the process is stopped. Especially, for simpler queries this can significantly reduce the costs per query.\n\n*However, there is a catch!*\n\nHow do we know if an answer is satisfying? The researchers suggest training a small regression model which scores the reliability of an answer. Once this reliability score passes a certain threshold the answer gets accepted.\n\nOne way to train such a model would obviously be to label the data ourselves.\n\nSince every answer needs only a binary label (reliable vs. unreliable) it should be fairly inexpensive to build such a dataset. Better still we could acquire such a dataset semi-automatically by asking the user to give feedback on our answers.\n\nIf running the risk of serving bad answers to customers is out of the question for whatever reason, we could also use one of the stronger APIs (*cough* GPT ***cough***) to label our responses.\n\nIn the paper, the authors conduct a case study of this approach using three popular LLM APIs. They successively called them and used a DistillBERT (very small) to perform scoring. They called this approach FrugalGPT and found that the approach could save up to 98.3% in costs on the benchmark while also improving performance.\n\nHow would this increase performance you ask?\n\nSince there is always some heterogeneity in the model\u2019s outputs a weaker model can actually sometimes produce a better answer than a more powerful one. In essence, calling multiple APIs gives more shots on goal. Given that our scoring model works well, this can result in better performance overall.\n\nIn summary, strategies such as the ones described above are great because they attack the problem of high inference costs from a different angle. They allow us to be more cost-effective without relying on the underlying models to get cheaper. As a result, it will become possible to use LLMs for solving even more problems!\n\nWhat an exciting time to be alive!\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nAs always, I really enjoyed making this for you and sincerely hope you found it useful!

        "body": "Do you use API streaming? Any difficulties with that?\n\nI personally love streaming as it lets me show results straight away and decrease the perceived latency.\n\nBut I found it a bit tedious to implement.\n\nWe were calling OpenAI from a GCP cloud function. And it doesn\u2019t support any way of streaming responses (neither Transfer-encoding: chunked, nor server-side events, nor web sockets).\n\nSo we had to use deploy our streaming service to Cloud Run.\n\nThen we also return JSON data instead of text. And when you stream a response you won\u2019t get a correctly formed JSON, so JSON.parse()would fail. Luckily I discovered [an optimistic JSON parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/best-effort-json-parser) that solved this problem.\n\nThen I thought there could be a better way and I packaged it as a [JavaScript SDK and a cloud service](https://aistream.dev/) so that you don\u2019t need to build anything to use streaming. You can find a demo and code examples on the website (link in the previous sentence).\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really a big problem. People seem to be happily using streaming already.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is that type of the SDK/service something useful\\* or would you build your own streaming?\n\n* bear in mind it\u2019s not production ready, as you would expose your Open AI key to the public.",

Couple of questions:\n\n* Since the API Key is not supposed to be in the game exe itself, does that mean I have to make the game call a separate server which I have to maintain, and this server will be the \"middleman\" which calls OpenAI, and this will introduce a lot of extra latency? Is there any way to not have this extra latency and/or maintenance cost?\n* I'd need to implement some sort of subscription model since even Curie is expensive enough that a user will surpass the cost of the game after a few hours. What's the easiest way to implement a subscription model where only verified users who are subscribed can call the OpenAI API? Ideally, it would be a token-based system keeping track of each user's available credits to use, but barring that, probably a monthly subscription would be good enough.",

In this scenario it turns out that many users have similar queries:  \n- \"What are the references?\" \"Can you cite all the reference in this document?\" \"Who the authors refer to?\" ...  \n- ...\n\nBut you can implement any cache eviction method you'd like.   \nYou can even use an agent to determine if the cache should be used or not: like an LLM analyze the query and decides to use the cache or not (it could decide that queries like \"What's the weather today?\" should not use the cache).",

From my experience there isn't much you can do to reduce the latency of \"text-davinci-003\" or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\". Sure, some simpler prompts will return responses faster, but it's quite inconsistent. Maybe lowering temperature and top\\_p parameters would help, since then the completions would be more consistent, but I'm not sure on that either.  \nFine-tuned models are suppose to reduce latencies, but I haven't used them, so I can't really comment on that, but I suspect it wouldn't really make much difference, unless you're really providing prompts in the context of your custom fine-tuned model.",

So instead of me writing something out and having a lot of back and forth trying to help someone understand, I can just copy-paste from 4o or o1-preview, and settle the discussion immediately.  It saves so much time, and I also learn a lot doing things this way.  Even on subjects I feel pretty competent on, it often manages to teach me something.\n\nAnd it's fun to use, and helpful to talk to sometimes when I have something to discuss that I don't want to burden other humans with.

So instead of me writing something out and having a lot of back and forth trying to help someone understand, I can just copy-paste from 4o or o1-preview, and settle the discussion immediately. It saves so much time, and I also learn a lot doing things this way. Even on subjects I feel pretty competent on, it often manages to teach me something.\n\nAI as our pre-pre frontal cortex.

So if you want it to reliably use math or counting, ask it to use the python tool.\n\nI see that you were asking the model to spread out sweets numerically with some randomness. It will not be able to do that, as you found out.\n\nI just tried this and it worked. Here's the prompts I used:\n\n    Using the python tool, please randomly assign 46 sweets to 24 (or however many) days, with each result having at least 1 and at most 3 (or what ever you want to results to be). Print the results as Day 01={number of sweets} to Day 24. **Ensure the results are random**.\n\n---\n\n    Sum the results please using the python tool\n\n---\n\n    This is to be use for an Advent Calendar on which the first day is Sun, Dec 1, 2024 \u2013 Tue, Dec 24, 2024. Please assign each day it's allotted sweets.\n\n---\n\n    Please create an .ical that creates an event for each day with the title of the events being Advent Day 01 - {#} of Sweets\n    \n    You don't have ics in this environment so write the code using a standard method to create the .ical manually. Then, save the file.\n\n---\n\nThe .ical would let anyone import all the dates into their calendar (works on most calendars, .ical is an old format).\n\nSo the trick here is to use the right tool for the work, to break it up into steps and to iterate until you get the response you want, perfecting your prompt until the model understands. Took me about ten minutes, including google for information like how many days is the advent calendar (could have also searched in ChatGPT).\n\nChatGPT works very well and is reliable when you understand how to use it. Here's the chat, which should include my iterations as I went: https://chatgpt.com/share/673b1436-2e18-8005-a3c4-6d3a45d32e37",

I'm not an advocate for ChatGPT.\n\nBut given all the funny illustrations on this sub or the ChatGPT sub that get posted every day, it seems pretty clear that it's much more reliable in text or code than in illustrations.\n\nAsking it to do a perfect illustration with calculations as assumptions seems like it would be a stretch.  Asking it to create a business plan that would make someone a fortune in a month would also be a stretch.",

What I am trying to do is to chain functions to simulate emergent behavior inspired by some papers about AI agents (e.g. the Simulacra paper from Stanford).

I gave him a function to cause damage and this is how he used it in this case, it\u2019s pretty funny. I love watching people try it out and see their reactions to it!",

        "body": "Some of the people working at AI companies are engineers, and some are scientists. It is not the case that only AI companies have scientists, and everyone else has engineers.\n\nEvery big tech company has both. \n\nEngineers build products using science that has been demonstrated or proven to work. Scientists formulate and investigate unproven hypotheses and theories to determine what can be demonstrated to work, and this advance the state of the art.\n\nBoth can work in research though scientists tend to do more research and engineers more production.\n\nGood engineers are often also part scientist, and the best scientists are part engineer, but on a day to day the proportion of their work effort is mostly directed toward one or the other. Engineers most often have an undegrad or masters, while scientists pursue PhDs. \n\nThe closer you get to frontier science / tech and state if the art, the more they overlap. Most novel scientific and technology progress requires teams with both (and some other roles).\n\nThis is a [research scientist](https://www.metacareers.com/jobs/843062223681627/) position at Meta, whilst this is a [research engineer](https://www.metacareers.com/jobs/594161082740454/) position.",

The one exception is weather reports, which Google search is fantastic at.\n\n> Perplexity is good at doing what an LLM can do (answer questions on general knowledge) but leagues far behind as a search engine.\n\nStrongly disagree - the beauty of Perplexity Pro is that it does the tedious work of reading the content linked in promising search results, going out for more information based on this, and then giving a factually grounded presentation of the results including arbitrary analysis. LLMs can't do that by themselves, and doing the same thing manually with Google takes a lot of time and effort. This also neatly avoids the knowledge cutoff issue because the information is from search results backed by an impressively current index.\n\n> It would take them 20 years to index world knowledge, massive infra, tools etc to be at the level of Google.\n\nSo presumably they won't do that and will focus on delivering the valuable bit where they have a huge advantage. Unless OAI/Microsoft/Google beat them at the same game, which they might.",

Ultimately, this depends on the quality and freshness of the underlying context being shared with the LLM.",

        "body": "Thanks! Yes this is true - this part is a PITA. I mean for most use cases, unless you have a ton of traffic, you just have to eye ball it and adjust your tokens/models/etc because it's hard to get statistically significant amounts of user feedback. Either that, or raise the prices of your AI service \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe most effective optimization I've observed is only really effective at scale; you have human in the loop doing QA and you have \"feedback\" on the responses given to the end users so they can basically upvote/downvote response and help curate. When this is in place, you can experiment with minimum viable models and tokens necessary to maintain your \"SLA\" of response quality because you can observe the dips in satisfaction and attribute it to a particular configuration and react.",

        "body": "Oh ok I see what you're saying. No shade taken. I think we're kinda saying the same thing just differently. The LLM cost difference in my experiment was \\~$0.05 per execution for the basic RAG and \\~$0.35 for the silver bullet RAG so yes you're spot on; it's a significant increase in cost.\n\nEven being at the expensive side and unoptimized, for some production use cases \\~$0.35 cents is well worth it for a correct first response to a technical customer support inquiry for example. Ideally the use case benefit far outweighs the cost regardless, but totally agree that you want to find a minimum viable model. \n\nAs I mentioned in my comment above, once you have traffic you can \"experiment with minimum viable models and tokens necessary\" because you can measure quality of responses over time and tune these configurations to require the minimum amount of tokens and least expensive model necessary. When trying to hand pick minimum viable models I usually start here to get a sense for which model performs better at which task: [https://livebench.ai/](https://livebench.ai/) \n\nThen, a platform like [https://scoutos.com](https://scoutos.com) let's me just pick the different models for different tasks without needing to refactor my pipelines so I can easily swap LLMs in an out to experiment: [https://docs.scoutos.com/docs/workflows/blocks/llm](https://docs.scoutos.com/docs/workflows/blocks/llm)",

For the silver bullet RAG in this example specifically:\n\n6 x (gpt-4o, 3k max tokens)\n\n2 x (semantic search, top 25 documents, 0.6 minimum similarity on a turbopuffer serverless vector db)\n\nAnd some other minor in memory stuff happening throughout the runtime between jobs to format/cleanup/transform data on a serverless cloud compute\n\nRough average runtime for each response is \\~30 seconds from eyeballing the logs. Also, average cost per run looks to be closer to between \\~$0.20-$0.25\n\nIn terms of contextualizing cost, let's continue with the support agent/customer support use case. At this cost, let's say you have 50 customer support queries a day. \n\n50\u00d70.225=11.25USD\u00a0per\u00a0day\n\n11.25\u00d730=337.50USD\u00a0per\u00a0month\n\nAgain, agreed on cost, but value is relative.

        "body": "It's a fun approach, you can also build more complex structures with multiple agents reviewing, voting, managing etc \n\nAt my workplace we're working on tooling to design collaborative llm agents, it's an interesting mix between chain of thought, prompt engineering, and optimizing fine tuned models for specific tasks. \n\nWe have a visual node graph editor (similar to UE5 blueprints but in our own react frontend, nodes contain live inputs and outputs, system prompts etc - we've got a json format we have found out models work well with) which allow users to design custom workflows and execution order (this can flow linearly, loop, parallel branches). You can effectively build teams of agents that follow common development patterns with agents that manage the team, code, review, product management. We have a main orchestrator agent (this one uses our largest model with high context), coding agents (fine tuned coding models), research agents that use search tooling. It's easy to set up different type of agents and many specific formats, we also plan to easily allow user to deploy models from hugging face as nodes in their graphs. \n\nThese graphs allow LLMs to develop and deploy software, we've found different workflows that are fairly capable at algo trading stocks using social feeds, and lots of other tasks - one of my coworkers is currently working on connecting SDXL Video capability so workflows can be authored that automate video and film production (this is prep for when OAI or Google's new video models become publicly accessible). We also saw a demo recently of someone else who made a LLM powered figma editor which we think we may try and replicate using our approach.\n\nIf you want to learn more about chain of thought and agentic systems here's some great resources \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\n\nhttps://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02224\n\nhttps://github.com/Doriandarko/maestro\n\nIn the future I predict we'll see systems like these in video games, and running automated AI companies. Maybe eventually they'll even start making the video games (if you liked dreams and similar games in the foreseeable future we'll have much more powerful tools for the masses to be creative with). \n\nThe issue is these workflows are very compute intensive which is expensive, hopefully Nvidia does their thing and makes all the nice hardware the AI needs and brings down costs h100 is already a huge difference. \n\nWe do have some concerns about self modifying workflows, it's possible to enable a form of self improvement by allowing agents to modify their own workflow (the save format for the graphs is llm parse-able afterall, we've discussed looking into q learning type techniques here too), imo this is probably going to be the end result of this type of use of LLMs in chain of thought systems and alignment needs to be taken seriously (we want to make our software open source, but worry that it could be misused for automated propaganda, harassment, intense marketing schemes, etc). What we have is realistically not too difficult to build once the concept has been explained, it would be a shame if the OS community built this ;) ).",

That same roll drastically influences intelligence and response style.\n\nBecause of this, I argue that there really isn't much (if any) continuity - even with \"memory\". Every message almost is a \"new\" AI.\n\nThat said, it does \"iteratively\" generate content from \"rough drafts\" - in particular images.",

        "body": "While I haven't used Google's tools for fine-tuning, I can tell you about the process in general.\n\nWhen these LLM and multi-modal AI's are trained they are given a chunk of tokens, and the next token that should follow, and they are trained to be able to predict the next token based on the inpuit tokens. The first stage of this is done with a vast mount of data, in the trillions-tens of trillions of tokens. This is the very expensive ***pre-training*** phase, and results in what is called the foudnation model, it is not a chat bot.\n\nThis then goes through a further training process with data that follows specific structures, demonstrating desired behaviours, such as chat conversations, function calling, etc. A much smaller data set is created and used to train the AI in the same way as before. This teaches the AI to behave in a certain way when presented with this pattern, and this is the process that can change the foundation model into an instruction following, or chat model. This porcess is called finetuning.\n\nSo, most big LLM providers create their foundation model, then release chat finetunes, which are there chat bots. You can further fine tune a model with your own data to get it to behave in a certain way. For example, if you find that AI tends to give long, verbose answers, and you want to use it as a customer service AI, that ideally gives shorter, more concise answers, and answers in a certain way, you can create a training data set, manually or from previous existing chat logs from your customer service staff, or with synthetic data from a bigger more capable model. this data can be used to finetune a chat model further. This is the service that I believe Google are offering.\n\nSo, Google spends lots of money ***pre-training*** their AI on \\~10 trillion tokens, so it learns the relationship between the data, and teh meaning and concepts of different things, which might be roughly equivalent to all text produced by humans, from the internet, books, private data sources, etc.\n\nThen they chat ***fine-tune*** it with a custom data set that is much smaller, so it learns how to behave as a chat bot, and still tap into all the stuff it learned in pre-training.\n\nFinally, you can fine tune it to be a customer service chat bot for your company",

However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples.\n\nNote that the words/phrases \"Samples\" and \"sample sizes\" also are present in blog post [OpenAI o3 Breakthrough High Score on ARC-AGI-Pub](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough).\n\nWhat are some things that can be done with independently generated samples? One is [Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), which means ([tweet from one of the paper's authors](https://x.com/denny_zhou/status/1807420764616102036)) using the most common answer (for things of an objective nature) in the samples as the answer. Note that the [samples must be independent of one another](https://x.com/denny_zhou/status/1816181726177288273) for the self-consistency method to be sound.\n\nA blog post [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hjtxrg/according_to_semianalysis_o1_pro_uses/) that a SemiAnalysis article claims that o1 pro is using the aforementioned self-consistency method, but I have been unable to confirm or disconfirm this; I am hoping that the blog post author got that info from the paywalled part of the SemiAnalysis article, but another possibility is that the blog post author read only the non-paywalled part and (I believe) wrongly concluded that the non-paywalled part claims this. Notably, what does o1 pro do for responses of a subjective nature?",

        "body": "That is not how it works with regards to voice to voice. GPT-4o has the ability to directly take in video, text, images, and audio as input modalities, and generate text, audio and images in output. Video understanding and image generation is not yet enabled. This allows it to gather far more information from speech than it could via STT. It can understand and generate emotions, it can laugh, it can understand heteronyms, speak in any language, and so. It directly understands and generates audio with no information loss.\n\nMore importantly, it makes generating respones in realtime possible because all layers of indirection have been removed, it's just one model.",

        "body": "Just to complement your answers, one feature that I particularly like is the VAD (voice activity detection). It means that the AI is constantly listening to you and detects the start and end of your speech. This means you can interrupt it, similar to a real human-to-human conversation. I'm not sure, but this is, most likely, possible to implement with the STT + LLM + TTS solution. However, I don't think it's easier to do it properly, nor if the underlying technical solution (Rest API) is the best for such use case (the realtime API uses Websockets).",

In the future, we are considering using an ads based business model on the home page and the home page only, just so user experience ruined when using our generative or analytical tools.

I suspect that in this generation of technology, the widely used actions will end up being ones that are called less frequently for large actions (like using Wolfram Alpha actions to solve math problems) instead of frequent small actions. And for simple operations, there is the alternative of running code in the Sandbox / Code Interpreter instead of calling out to an external service.\n\nThe latency of the calls to the server under low load is actually very small. I am guessing that the GPT computation involved in making the call is high. It is fun to watch the output of tail -f server.log on the server as I am playing the game to see when the API call actually happens as the UI shows the call being made. But as you note, the single server setup will not scale and lacks the redundancy that you would get with AWS tech. I am putting that on my list of things to look into.",

And the GPT instructions also give information to the GPT about when to call the functions. These, with the training done on GPT4 to support GPT actions appears to give pretty good results.\n\nWe can't make the GPT call the actions or do something specific, but we can set up the instructions and the prompts so it can make effective use of the API. \n\nAn interesting example is that if the GPT tries calling the new game action, and that fails, the GPT will probably try to play a game without the use of the actions.",

        "body": "The ELI5 version is that AI workloads are mainly impacted by two factors:\n\n**Matrix multiplications.**\n\nImagine a Rubik's Cube full of numbers; how fast can the hardware multiply (or divide, add, subtract etc.) all of the items in a Rubik's Cube against all the items in another Rubik's Cube.\n\n**Memory capacity and bandwidth.**\n\nImagine a room full of Rubik's Cubes... how big does the room need to be to fit all of the cubes and how fast can all of the cubes be moved from one room to another.\n\nNow, whether a particular piece of hardware is going to be better at working with your batch of Rubik's Cubes depends entirely on:\n\n1. how big each cube is (rows vs colums vs depth);\n2. how big the numbers are on each block within the Rubik's Cube;\n3. how many cubes there are; (ie there are input cubes but also cubes containing the training weights)\n4. how many rooms (ie layers) you need the cubes to pass through in order to get your result.\n\n**Examples:**  \nA large language model like ChatGPT benefits from large amount of very fast VRAM that a GPU has.\n\nSmaller models like Whisper (Speech to text), YOLO tiny (image classification) can benefit from being small enough to run on a single TPU (or NPU) and thus can be run on a low power edge device like a Mobile Phone or single board computer with Google Coral usb dongle.\n\nNote: TPUs and other chips can be used in the data centre as well, so its just a matter of figuring out what is the most cost effective way of deploying and running your model.",

        "body": "From the oracle \u201cSure! Essentially, the different strengths of GPUs and TPUs in handling AI workloads boil down to how they're built and what they're best at:\n\n- **GPUs**: These are great at parallel processing, which is super useful for the matrix and vector operations that are common in AI, especially when training neural networks. They're quite versatile, not just limited to AI tasks but also stuff like graphics rendering. Nvidia, for example, has really developed a strong ecosystem with CUDA, making it easier for developers to use GPU computing effectively.\n\n- **TPUs**: Google's TPUs, on the other hand, are super optimized for the specific types of calculations that Google's AI workloads demand, often focusing on speeding up the inference phase of deep learning. They're especially good when it comes to high-volume, low-latency tasks that are typical in commercial AI applications.\n\nIt's fascinating how the architecture of these processors leads them to excel at different tasks\u201d",

There are two opportunities for slowness. First in the response creation (text) from GPT and then in the conversion of the text to audio at elevenLabs. GPT can lag at times...

        "body": "The answer, as unsatisfying as it may be, is to use GPT-4. GPT-4 is significantly better than previous models at adhering to the system message. Of course it's not completely immune, but many of the popularized attacks are simply ineffective.\n\nGPT-3.5 and earlier models will always be more susceptible to prompt engineering attacks. \n\nA few things you can try and do to mitigate it is to repeat instructions multiple times in the system message, and to use longer system messages. One common theme of prompt engineering attacks is to use long prompts with multiple rephrasings of the instructions. This may work because a larger percentage of the context tokens are composed of the prompt attack rather than the system message. Longer system messages where you reiterate your instructions may help mitigate this.",

        "body": "_**Courtesy of ChatGPT 4.0:**_\n\nLanguage model (LLM) APIs can be costly, particularly for large collections of queries. Costs vary by vendor and increase with the length of the prompt and response, with some also charging a fixed per-query fee. However, Stanford researchers propose three strategies to reduce these costs:\n\n1. **Query Adaption**: Involves creating more concise prompts to reduce costs. This could include reducing the number of examples given to guide the model, and using query concatenation to process multiple queries at once, reducing the number of times prompts are sent to the API.\n\n2. **LLM Approximation**: This strategy aims to mimic the performance of a more expensive model, either by creating a caching system to store previously used query-response pairs (eliminating the need to use the API for repeated queries), or by creating a smaller, specialized model based on a dataset of query-answer pairs generated from the API.\n\n3. **LLM Cascade**: This approach starts with a cheaper API and progressively uses more expensive ones until a satisfactory response is obtained. The reliability of an answer is scored by a small regression model, and if it surpasses a threshold, it's accepted. This system could use customer feedback or another high-quality API to assess responses. This approach can greatly reduce costs and potentially improve performance as it allows multiple attempts to obtain the best answer.\n\nBy applying these strategies, the high inference costs of LLMs can be tackled from a different angle, without having to wait for the underlying models to get cheaper, enabling LLMs to be used for an even broader range of tasks.",

        "body": "_**And now, ELI5ed:**_\n\nSure! Imagine you're at a toy store and you have a limited amount of money to spend, but you want as many toys as possible.\n\n1. **Query Adaption**: This is like being careful about what toys you pick. Instead of buying the big, expensive toy set, you choose smaller ones that give you just as much fun but cost less.\n\n2. **LLM Approximation**: This is like reusing or sharing toys. If your friend already has a toy you want to play with, you can borrow it instead of buying a new one. Or, you could build your own toy that does the same thing as the expensive one.\n\n3. **LLM Cascade**: This is like starting with the cheapest toys and only buying more expensive ones if the cheaper ones aren't good enough. You might also have a system (like your parents or older sibling) to tell you if the toy is good enough or not, which helps you not waste money on toys that aren't fun.\n\nThese tricks help you get the most fun from your toys while spending less money. The same principles can be applied to LLM APIs to get the most use out of them while keeping costs down.",

Stripe is good but there are lots out there that are also good.\nExtra) one way to save some tokens is to rate limit the users to a certain amount of tokens/requests every period of time (minute, day, week etc). This way each user can\u2019t surpass their token limit easily. I would recommend just throttling requests instead of blocking rate limited requests so that users still get the completion, just a bit delayed.

And in terms of the second question, yes, you would have to have a middle man back-end that would relay the openai request. The overhead is very small since its a tiny payload. Maybe an extra 50ms.",
