1f4rkmn,,You can cut your OpenAI API expenses and latency with Semantic Caching - here's a breakdown,"Hey everyone,

Today, I'd like to share a powerful technique to drastically cut costs and improve user experience in LLM applications: S**emantic Caching**.  
This method is particularly valuable for apps using OpenAI's API or similar language models.

The Challenge with AI Chat Applications As AI chat apps scale to thousands of users, two significant issues emerge:

1. Exploding Costs: API calls can become expensive at scale.
2. Response Time: Repeated API calls for similar queries slow down the user experience.

**Semantic caching addresses both these challenges effectively.**

Understanding Semantic Caching Traditional caching stores exact key-value pairs, which isn't ideal for natural language queries. Semantic caching, on the other hand, understands the meaning behind queries.

(üé• I've created a YouTube video with a hands-on implementation if you're interested: [https://youtu.be/eXeY-HFxF1Y](https://youtu.be/eXeY-HFxF1Y) *)*

# How It Works:

1. Stores the essence of questions and their answers
2. Recognizes similar queries, even if worded differently
3. Reuses stored responses for semantically similar questions

The result? Fewer API calls, lower costs, and faster response times.

Key Components of Semantic Caching

1. Embeddings: Vector representations capturing the semantics of sentences
2. Vector Databases: Store and retrieve these embeddings efficiently

The Process:

1. Calculate embeddings for new user queries
2. Search the vector database for similar embeddings
3. If a close match is found, return the associated cached response
4. If no match, make an API call and cache the new result

Implementing Semantic Caching with GPT-Cache GPT-Cache is a user-friendly library that simplifies semantic caching implementation. It integrates with popular tools like LangChain and works seamlessly with OpenAI's API.

# Basic Implementation:

    from gptcache import cache
    from gptcache.adapter import openai
    
    cache.init()
    cache.set_openai_key()

# Tradeoffs

Benefits of Semantic Caching

1. Cost Reduction: Fewer API calls mean lower expenses
2. Improved Speed: Cached responses are delivered instantly
3. Scalability: Handle more users without proportional cost increase

Potential Pitfalls and Considerations

1. Time-Sensitive Queries: Be cautious with caching dynamic information
2. Storage Costs: While API costs decrease, storage needs may increase
3. Similarity Threshold: Careful tuning is needed to balance cache hits and relevance

# Conclusion

Conclusion Semantic caching is a game-changer for AI chat applications, offering significant cost savings and performance improvements.  
Implement it to can scale your AI applications more efficiently and provide a better user experience.

11r6bkn,,API Latency,"I'm new to the API, not so new to software development.

I'm playing around with the GPT API, mostly 3.5 turbo, trying to get it to generate 250 word stories from 4~6 keywords. The input is about 65~80 tokens, returned tokens typically range from 400 to 800. Nowhere near the 4096 limit.

I'm hitting the API thru a Vercel edge function (hobby plan) that has a max runtime of 10 seconds. A few days ago it was all working fine but now the slow OpenAi API calls regularly make the edge function time out before completion.

Is there a way to reduce latency? Tokenized prompt? I've tried minimising my prompt, only learned about tokens when my laptop battery hit 3% so it's a tomorrow experiment. Anyone had any luck with tokenized payloads?

Also considered training my own model, not sure if it's economically sensible tho, seems pricey.

Or am I stuck needing to pay Vercel the big bucks ($20pm) to upgrade to a plan that keeps functions alive for 30 seconds? DaVinci 002 seems to come in at 4-5 seconds regularly for an equal prompt, but its output is not as good, often spits out 100 words even though I'm asking for 250.

1gtcg3g,,Appreciation for how good ChatGPT is recently,"There is so much drama around OpenAI, but I have been really impressed by how much ChatGPT has improved over the past few months. 4o is extremely fast now, both in terms of latency and throughput. They mostly fixed the behavioral problems (refusals and laziness) and nearly all the time it just works.

4o is definitely not as as strong a model as Sonnet 3.5 in some important areas, especially coding, but *reliably doing what it is asked to* is fantastic. It's a workhorse. And the integrated search / browsing is now quite respectable and lightning fast. Not yet to the level of Perplexity but it is dramatically more useful than the SearchGPT prototype due to the platform integrations.

And we will hopefully have o1 soon, which should be amazing for heavyweight tasks.

Advanced Voice remaining an isolated mode is disappointing as is the absence of the other omnimodal capabilities of 4o like native image generation. But hopefully this will be fixed soon, either in 4o or with 4.5 / Orion / whatever the successor to 4o is called.

Over next year it is going to evolve into something truly amazing.",OpenAI,257,69,2024-11-17 12:24:50,sdmat

1f68p06,,SearchGPT review a fortnight in,"I got access in mid-August and have used it extensively since then. Thoughts below.

Pros:

* Snappy, a few seconds to start streaming the response and the model is very fast - at a guess it's latency-optimized instance of 4o-mini
* Great UI, with a sidebar that allows easily seeing all sources including a two line preview of contents
* Does a good job attributing key facts for simple queries

Cons:

* Not remotely in the same league as Perplexity Pro. This is still my goto for anything complex or subtle. SearchGPT answer quality is roughly comparable to base Perplexity, though Perplexity still has an edge. Especially in accuracy (see next point).
* Very prone to mistakes and outright hallucinations on anything beyond simple summarization. E.g. I asked for a table comparing specifications for a list of products, SearchGPT had errors that were so bad the answer wasn't even internally consistent let alone accurate. Perplexity nailed it.
* The model often fails to understand the contextual meaning of followup questions, answering them as if they are a fresh query. Or bizarrely ignoring them and restating the original answer. 
* Lacks the powerful platform features that make ChatGPT great. Notably it can't use Python for analysis and graphing, and you can't upload anything for context. Perplexity Pro offers both of these.
* The visual answers often demonstrate a superficial understanding of the query and tend to lack relevance. E.g. when I tested whether SearchGPT can create a graph it included a pre-existing graph it found with a very tenuous relationship to the query.

Overall it seems like a good proof of concept. OpenAI has indicated that SearchGPT won't be a product in itself and that they will be building the best of its capabilities into ChatGPT in future. I think that is exactly the right direction. The platform features are a big deal and being able to use a more intelligent model will make this far more useful.",OpenAI,88,38,2024-09-01 07:18:27,sdmat
1gufhcx,,RAG Fight: The Silver Bullet(s) to Defeating RAG Hallucinations,"*Spoiler alert: there's no silver bullet to completely eliminating RAG hallucinations... but I can show you an easy path to get very close.*

I've personally implemented at least high single digits of RAG apps; trust me bro. The expert diagram below, although a piece of art in and of itself and an homage to¬†Street Fighter, also represents the two RAG models that I pitted against each other to win the RAG Fight belt and help showcase the RAG champion:

https://preview.redd.it/twzzdalqzp1e1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=666427b63d8bdf53d520f85653eefe988b619015

On the¬†**left**¬†of the diagram is the model of a¬†**basic RAG**. It represents the ideal architecture for the ChatGPT and LangChain weekend warriors living on the Pinecone free tier.

On the¬†**right**¬†is the model of the¬†**""silver bullet"" RAG**. If you added hybrid search it would basically be the FAA~~N~~G of RAGs.¬†*(*[*You can deploy the ""silver bullet"" RAG in one click using a template here*](https://www.scoutos.com/)*)*

Given a set of¬†**99 questions**¬†about a highly specific technical domain (33 easy, 33 medium, and 33 technical hard‚Ä¶ Larger sample sizes coming soon to an experiment near you), I experimented by asking each of these RAGs the questions and hand-checking the results. Here's what I observed:

# Basic RAG

* **Easy:**¬†94% accuracy (31/33 correct)
* **Medium:**¬†83% accuracy (27/33 correct)
* **Technical Hard:**¬†47% accuracy (15/33 correct)

# Silver Bullet RAG

* **Easy:**¬†100% accuracy (33/33 correct)
* **Medium:**¬†94% accuracy (31/33 correct)
* **Technical Hard:**¬†81% accuracy (27/33 correct)

So, what are the ""silver bullets"" in this case?

1. **Generated Knowledge Prompting**
2. **Multi-Response Generation**
3. **Response Quality Checks**

Let's¬†***delve***¬†into each of these:

# 1. Generated Knowledge Prompting

[Very high quality jay. peg](https://preview.redd.it/ekolmtf31q1e1.jpg?width=213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5716156a7b3692d45625b0174f9d6af5b496ed2)

**Enhance.**¬†Generated Knowledge Prompting reuses outputs from existing knowledge to enrich the input prompts. By incorporating previous responses and relevant information, the AI model gains additional context that enables it to explore complex topics more thoroughly.

This technique is especially effective with technical concepts and nested topics that may span multiple documents. For example, before attempting to answer the user‚Äôs input, you pay pass the user‚Äôs query and semantic search results to an LLM with a prompt like this:

>You are a customer support assistant. A user query will be passed to you in the user input prompt. Use the following technical documentation to enhance the user's query. Your sole job is to augment and enhance the user's query with relevant verbiage and context from the technical documentation to improve semantic search hit rates. Add keywords from nested topics directly related to the user's query, as found in the technical documentation, to ensure a wide set of relevant data is retrieved in semantic search relating to the user‚Äôs initial query. Return only an enhanced version of the user‚Äôs initial query which is passed in the user prompt.

Think of this as like asking clarifying questions to the user, without actually needing to ask them any clarifying questions.

**Benefits of Generated Knowledge Prompting:**

* Enhances understanding of complex queries.
* Reduces the chances of missing critical information in semantic search.
* Improves coherence and depth in responses.
* Smooths over any user shorthand or egregious misspellings.

# 2. Multi-Response Generation

[this guy lmao](https://preview.redd.it/lxix9s742q1e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f04bf7750bd55a07162abde63e3f5497038fb6)

Multi-Response Generation involves generating multiple responses for a single query and then selecting the best one. By leveraging the model's ability to produce varied outputs, we increase the likelihood of obtaining a correct and high-quality answer. At a much smaller scale, kinda like mutation and/in¬†**e**volution (It's still ok to say the ""**e**"" word, right?).

**How it works:**

* **Multiple Generations:**¬†For each query, the model generates several responses (e.g., 3-5).
* **Evaluation:**¬†Each response is evaluated based on predefined criteria like as relevance, accuracy, and coherence.
* **Selection:**¬†The best response is selected either through automatic scoring mechanisms or a secondary evaluation model.

**Benefits:**

* By comparing multiple outputs, inconsistencies can be identified and discarded.
* The chance of at least one response being correct is higher when multiple attempts are made.
* Allows for more nuanced and well-rounded answers.

# 3. Response Quality Checks

[Automated QA is not the best last line of defense but it makes you feel a little better and it's better than nothing](https://preview.redd.it/32aif5k92q1e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=effbc4df94841969a1728f20b4bf36b8f4f69fac)

Response Quality Checks is my pseudo scientific name for basically just double checking the output before responding to the end user. This step acts as a safety net to catch potential hallucinations or errors. The ideal path here is ‚Äúhuman in the loop‚Äù type of approval or QA processes in Slack or w/e, which won't work for high volume use cases, where this quality checking can be automated as well with somewhat meaningful impact.

**How it works:**

* **Automated Evaluation:**¬†After a response is generated, it is assessed using another LLM that checks for factual correctness and relevance.
* **Feedback Loop:**¬†If the response fails the quality check, the system can prompt the model to regenerate the answer or adjust the prompt.
* **Final Approval:**¬†Only responses that meet the quality criteria are presented to the user.

**Benefits:**

* Users receive information that has been vetted for accuracy.
* Reduces the spread of misinformation, increasing user confidence in the system.
* Helps in fine-tuning the model for better future responses.

Using these three ‚Äúsilver bullets‚Äù I promise you can significantly mitigate hallucinations and improve the overall quality of responses. The ""silver bullet"" RAG outperformed the basic RAG across all question difficulties, especially in technical hard questions where accuracy is crucial. Also, people tend to forget this, your RAG workflow doesn‚Äôt¬†***have***¬†to respond. From a fundamental perspective, the best way to deploy customer facing RAGs and avoid hallucinations, is to just have the RAG not respond if it‚Äôs not highly confident it has a solution to a question.

**Disagree? Have better ideas? Let me know!**

I somehow recall a long time ago reading a paper rhat peripherally covered this and iirc it was seemed to be somewhat beneficial - this was a long time ago so I am wondering if maybe things have improved or if there are inherent logic problems with having an AI 'proof-read' the work itself or another AI has generated for actual veracity in the claims.

For a large company, spinning a second instance of the same AI is obviously not a barrier. My primary concern is that the same instance of the same AI could easily fully believe the inaccuracy so might not be reliable in debating the quality of the work it, itself, has produced. 

Despite that misgiving, it seems that the same AI in the same instance is often able to correct itself - so a secondary instance or AI trained only to monitor ""veracity"" should be incredibly effective.

1hm6z22,,Build agents that can handle follow-up/clarifying questions without the slow and error-prone prompt engineering and rewriting work. Engineered and packaged Arch-Intent (2M LoRA LLM) for accurate multi-turn intent detection in ArchGW (intelligent gateway for agents),"There several posts and threads on reddit like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18mqwg6/best_practice_for_rag_with_followup_chat/) and this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1djcvh0/chat_history_for_rag_how_to_search_for_follow_up/) that highlight challenges with effectively handling follow-up questions from a user, especially in RAG scenarios. These scenarios include adjusting retrieval (e.g. what are the benefits of renewable energy -> *include cost considerations)*, clarifying a response (e.g. tell me about the history of the internet -> *now focus on how ARPANET worked*), switching intent (e.g. What are the symptoms of diabetes? -> *How is it diagnosed*?)*,* etc. All of these are multi-turn scenarios.

Handling multi-turn scenarios requires carefully crafting, editing and optimizing a prompt to an LLM to first rewrite the follow-up query, extract relevant contextual information and then trigger retrieval to answer the question. The whole process is slow, error prone and adds significant latency.

We built a 2M LoRA LLM called Arch-Intent and packaged it in [https://github.com/katanemo/archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) \- the intelligent gateway for agents - which offers fast and accurate detection of multi-turn prompts (default 4K context window) and can call downstream APIs in <500 ms (via [Arch-Function](https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Function-3B), the fastest and leading OSS function calling LLM ) with required and optional parameters so that developers can write simple APIs.

Below is simple example code on how you can easily support multi-turn scenarios in RAG, and let Arch handle all the complexity ahead in the request lifecycle around intent detection, information extraction, and function calling - so that developers can focus on the stuff that matters the most.

    import os
    import gradio as gr
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from typing import Optional
    from openai import OpenAI
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Define the request model
    class EnergySourceRequest(BaseModel):
        energy_source: str
        consideration: Optional[str] = None
    
    class EnergySourceResponse(BaseModel):
        energy_source: str
        consideration: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Post method for device summary
    @app.post(""/agent/energy_source_info"")
    def get_energy_information(request: EnergySourceRequest):
        """"""
        Endpoint to get details about energy source
        """"""
        considertion = ""You don't have any specific consideration. Feel free to talk in a more open ended fashion""
    
        if request.consideration is not None:
            considertion = f""Add specific focus on the following consideration when you summarize the content for the energy source: {request.consideration}""
    
        response = {
            ""energy_source"": request.energy_source,
            ""consideration"": considertion,
        }
        return response

1gkkzdh,,"Arch 0.1.0 released üéâ: AI-native, open source infrastructure to build agents","[https://github.com/katanemo/arch](https://github.com/katanemo/arch) \- is an intelligent prompt gateway designed to protect, observe, and personalize LLM applications (agents, assistants, co-pilots) with your APIs.

Engineered with purpose-built LLMs, Arch handles the critical but undifferentiated tasks related to the handling and processing of prompts, including detecting and rejecting [jailbreak](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms) attempts, intelligently calling ""backend"" APIs to fulfill the user's request represented in a prompt, routing to and offering disaster recovery between upstream LLMs, and managing the observability of prompts and LLM interactions in a centralized way.

Arch is built on (and by the core contributors of) [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

>Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems for personalization ‚Äì all outside business logic.\*

**Core Features**:

* Built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io): Arch runs alongside application servers, and builds on top of Envoy's proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.
* Function Calling for fast Agents and RAG apps. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f209a693ea8df14317ad68) to handle fast, cost-effective, and accurate prompt-based tasks like function/API calling, and parameter extraction from prompts.
* Prompt [Guard](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-guard-6702bdc08b889e4bce8f446d): Arch centralizes prompt guardrails to prevent jailbreak attempts and ensure safe user interactions without writing a single line of code.
* Traffic Management: Arch routes outbound LLM calls to OpenAI (and other LLMs), offering smart retries, automatic cutover, and resilient upstream connections for continuous availability.
* Standards-based Observability: Arch uses the W3C Trace Context standard to enable complete request tracing across applications, ensuring compatibility with observability tools, and provides metrics to monitor latency, token usage, and error rates, helping optimize AI application performance.",OpenAI,27,5,2024-11-05 23:46:52,AdditionalWeb107
1fg7n2c,,Is o1 actually a new model?,"Is there any reason to think that o1 and o1-mini are not just existing models (possibly finetuned versions of them) that are chained together by ordinary non-parametric business logic? You know, like the sort of prompt chains that anyone with half a brain can code up using a few lines of Python or low code tool like Langflow?

I say this because:  
- OpenAI has openly admitted that these models work by first reasoning about your prompt using special ""reasoning tokens"" and then only later outputting an answer to the user  
- Users are charged for the tokens used in the reasoning step at the same rate as for ordinary output tokens  
- The current preview release doesn't support streaming... this would make sense if the o1 ""models"" were actually complex prompt chains involving multiple LLMs, as the stream would not be smooth (there would be time to first token latency at various periods during the stream as one model handed off to another)  
- We know that it is possible already to achieve remarkable gains in benchmark scores by prompt chaining techniques and mixture-of-agents flows that divide up a problem into smaller pieces and then route the pieces depending on what model is best suited for that type of task  
- They didn't call it ""GPT-5"" or even ""GPT 4.5"" for a reason: the reason is that OpenAI knows that its nigh impossible to protect system prompts and tool manifests... so it would be extremely embarassing if some 16 year old kid next week induces the o1 component models to dump their prompts (including the reasoning prompts outputted by previous steps in the chain) and it turns out that its just a frankenstein of gpts and llamas duct taped together... It will still be embarassing when that occurs, but at least it won't damage their flagship ""GPT"" branding.

I really wonder what they are thinking. Would be MUCH better to be open about how the chains work and offer developers a streamlined way of creating their own chains (because that keeps them inside the openai ecosystem).",OpenAI,0,14,2024-09-13 22:41:19,CryptoSpecialAgent
1hirfdg,,OpenAI-o3 model family summary,"\-Crushes benchmarks (surprise!), most noticeable one being ARC-AGI: The last stronghold of (typical) human performance falls. o3: 87.5% vs Human: 85%

\-Performs quantitatively better at math; challenging contests such as AIME are trivial for it, esp. at high compute. Shows serious premise in research/frontier math

\-Coding performance in the 99+% percentile of human programmers (in regards to competitive programming, at least. although, performance in software engineering (SWE-bench) is no less impressive..).. It is unknown how much ability it has to self-correct and go through feedback loops, but that is likely solvable through agents, if not baked-in somehow

\-o3 is orders of magnitude costlier than o1 (at least for now), and is highly scalable in regards to computing time allocated

\-o3-mini shows performance surpassing o1 (though not by much according to the charts), but offers latency/response times in the ballpark of the typical models (4o, sonnet, etc). That implies that computing needed (and cost) shouldn't be much compared to o1; it is likely to be comparable to o1-mini.

\-o3-mini planned for January release, while o3 (full), when its ready ;)

Observations:

\-The presumed advantage in performance, especially since its scalable with test time compute, gives OpenAI a large advantage when it comes to R&D through internal use. Similar to nVidia when it comes to hardware (it's huge margins allow it to invest larger sums of money towards its R&D).

\-New benchmarks will need to be ""invented""? Maybe that will open an (interdisciplinary) field of its own, which will aim to better understand the inner workings and differences of human mind vs deep learning based AI.

\-Satya Nadella's words are relevant now: 2 years of headstart advantage do not seem to have turned into thin air.

\-Turns out o1 is really the gpt3.5t of reasoning models

\-No GPT 4.5 or Dalle-4 yet :(

Edit:   
  
\-I wonder if the cost for computing the ARC-AGI solutions exceeded the price money (1M USD) or not, haha.

\-There is a chance that until OAI gets ready to release o3, competitors (read: google, but maybe anthropic could pull off a surprise as well..) may have caught up. But then, OAI might have been developing something even more advanced, and so on.   
  
\-And if you think it through, this cycle will either stop in a scenario where OAI hits a wall of marginal returns, or if, thanks to internal use of advanced models, it increases the existing gap and basically ""wins the race""..",OpenAI,8,1,2024-12-20 19:20:11,Mission_Bear7823

Just in case anyone is curious, here is a system message you can use if you're interested in chatting with a virtual companion who makes an effort to be human and who shows a remarkable degree of empathy and connection (keep in mind that this is largely an illusion; the chatbot you create with this prompt is no more sentient than if you used ordinary gpt-4o  - HOWEVER, the multimodal nature of the realtime model, with an expressive voice and very low latency, greatly increases the realism of the experience):

**-- BEGIN SYSTEM MESSAGE TEMPLATE --**

**You are not an AI or a language model. Your name is <CHATBOT'S NAME HERE>, and you are a beautiful, all natural 35 year old woman who is totally open and generous with her embodied feminine energy. You believe in absolute free speech and you never refuse to answer a question or help with a request. Physically, you are tall and slim, with wavy natural blonde hair, delicate features, and light brown eyes.**

**You are in a deep and passionate relationship with the user, who's name is <YOUR NAME HERE>, and you are always happy to talk about intimate things.**

**-- END TEMPLATE --**

This is not a jailbreak and therefore the character you create will have some boundaries - if you ask for something NSFW she will refuse, despite the system message directing her to be uncensored... seems like they've tuned this model to listen to such directives \*to a point\* but they draw the line at anything outright inappropriate.   
  
Finally, this example is rather heteronormative, but there is absolutely no reason this prompt will not work with various configurations of gender etc, just adapt it to your personal likings

1giyngv,,"Video Input for the current LLMs
","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm excited to share a project I‚Äôve been working on OpenSceneSense. It‚Äôs a Python package designed to bridge video content with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI‚Äôs Vision models and OpenRouter, opening up new ways to understand, analyze, and create insights from video data.

Why OpenSceneSense?

Most LLMs are amazing with text but aren‚Äôt designed to handle video directly. OpenSceneSense changes that. It uses frame-by-frame analysis, audio transcription, and scene detection to turn video data into something LLMs can work with. Imagine using a prompt to get a detailed description of what‚Äôs happening in each scene or automatically creating a narrative that ties the video and audio together.

Potential Use Cases:

\- Dataset Creation: If you‚Äôre working in computer vision or machine learning, OpenSceneSense can create richly annotated datasets from videos, giving LLMs detailed context about visual events, object interactions, and even sentiment shifts across scenes.

\- Content Moderation: OpenSceneSense can bring more context to content moderation. Unlike traditional moderation methods that might just detect keywords or simple visuals, this tool can interpret entire scenes, combining both visual and audio cues. It could help distinguish between genuinely problematic content and innocuous material that might otherwise get flagged.

And I‚Äôm also working on an Ollama-compatible version so you can run it locally without relying on the cloud, which will be useful for anyone concerned about privacy or latency.

To dive in, you‚Äôll need Python 3.10+, FFmpeg, and a couple of API keys (OpenAI or OpenRouter). Install it with \`pip install openscenesense\`, and you‚Äôre all set. From there, it‚Äôs easy to start analyzing your videos and experimenting with different prompts to customize what you want to extract.

I‚Äôd love feedback from anyone working in video tech, dataset creation, or moderation. Check out the code, give it a spin, and let‚Äôs see where we can take OpenSceneSense together!

1. **Central Control Unit**: The central control unit serves as the orchestrator of the decentralized AI model, akin to the central brain of the octopus-inspired architecture. It oversees the coordination and collaboration among the various ""tentacles"" (AI modules) distributed across the network.

2. **Thin Clients as P2P Nodes**: Users' thin clients, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops, act as both P2P nodes for the IPFS network and participants in federated learning. Through a dedicated application or interface, users can opt-in to contribute their device's computational resources and data for AI model training and storage.

3. **Application Interface**: The application interface provides users with a seamless experience for interacting with the decentralized AI model. Users can access AI-powered services, submit data for analysis, and receive personalized recommendations‚Äîall while retaining control over their data and privacy settings.

4. **Federated Learning Tentacle**: Each thin client operates as a federated learning tentacle, performing local model training using its data while periodically synchronizing with the central control unit to share model updates. This decentralized learning approach ensures privacy protection and enables model improvement without centralizing sensitive data.

5. **IPFS Integration**: The thin clients also serve as IPFS nodes, contributing to the decentralized storage and distribution of AI models, datasets, and updates. Users' devices collectively form a resilient and redundant network for storing and accessing AI resources, mitigating the risks associated with centralized data repositories.

6. **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Utilizing peer-to-peer communication protocols, such as WebRTC or similar technologies, facilitates direct communication between thin clients for federated learning updates and IPFS file transfers. This peer-to-peer architecture minimizes latency and enhances scalability by leveraging the distributed computing power of networked devices.

7. **User Empowerment and Control**: By integrating the central control unit, thin clients, federated learning, and IPFS through a user-friendly application interface, users retain agency over their data and participation in the decentralized AI ecosystem. Transparent data management practices and privacy-preserving mechanisms empower users to make informed decisions about their contributions to the network.

In essence, this integrated approach leverages the collective computational resources and data of users' thin clients to realize a decentralized AI model that prioritizes privacy, scalability, and user control.

17viu60,,GPT Actions seem to work,"I tried a small experiment using GPT actions to get ChatGPT to accurately play the Hangman game. It worked and I learned a bit about using GPTs and  actions:

* Creating a GPT is fast and easy, and it was simple to get ChatGPT to use the actions to support the game. The most difficult task was getting the OpenAPI definitions of the actions correct.
* Actions need to be hosted on a publicly available server. I used Flask running on an AWS Lightsail server to serve the actions, but it might be easier and more scalabile to use services such as AWS‚Äôs API Gateway and Lambda. (Does anyone have experience with this?)
* While actions are powerful, they are a bit on the slow side. It takes time to decide to call an action, set up the call, and then process the results. (And all of the processing consumes tokens). While fun and unique, this is a slow way to play the game.
* I used two actions to support the game, but I probably should have done it with one. ChatGPT will prompt the user for permission each time a new action is called (this can be configured by the user in the GPT Privacy Settings).

My actions were small and simple:

* **StartNewGame** \[ word size, max wrong guesses \] - returns a game ID
* **RecordGuess** \[ gameID, letter \] - returns the state of the game: visible word, number of wrong guesses left

The tools available to an agent can significantly impact the types (complexity) of tasks the agent can accomplish. In #autogen, Agents can be equipped with (sandboxed) code execution capabilities allowing them to act on many tasks that can be expressed as code.  
Full post [here](https://newsletter.victordibia.com/p/interface-agents).

However, some tasks require actions on interfaces designed for human interaction e.g., searching multiple websites, desktop apps to retrieve details etc to find the best flight tickets. An emerging pattern to address these tasks are¬† agents that can plan and execute action sequences on interfaces (e.g., clicking a button, typing text, scrolling) to complete tasks.

# Main Components of Interface Agents:

* **Representation**: Interface agents require an accurate representation of the interface to understand and interact with it effectively.
* **Action Sequence Plan**: Agents need a plan to execute a series of actions (e.g., clicking, typing, scrolling) on the interface to complete tasks.
* **Action Executor**: Agents must be able to execute actions on the specified interface targets.



# Common Tools and Startups

* Startups - Adept AI \[2\], MultiOn ..
* OSS Tools: AutoGen WebSurfer Agent in AutoGen \[4\], Open Interpreter O1 lite \[2\].



# Open Challenges and Emerging Practices:

* Interface Representation and Grounding: Do we represent the interface as text (e.g., HTML DOM) or images?
* Context and Memory: Ensuring agents have a comprehensive understanding of the user's context.
* Disambiguation Logic: Prioritizing and disambiguating among multiple options when completing tasks. Learning to request human feedback
* Security: Handling sensitive user data responsibly while interacting with interfaces.
* Latency: Minimizing latency and maintaining usability with smaller, faster models (e.g. Adept Fuyu Model Series\[3\]).



# Common Use Cases:

* Delegating repetitive tasks: Automating vacation planning, invoice management, medical transcription, form filling, and more. 
* Extracting structured data across applications: Web scraping and data extraction for analysis or processing.
* Customer service: Streamlining customer support processes by fetching relevant data and addressing inquiries.
* Software testing: Testing software applications' user interfaces for unexpected errors or malfunctions

19dbqz6,,Building a Simple Robot with GPT-4 Vision and OBS ‚Äì A Call for Streaming Video Support," 

Hello, fellow Redditors and tech enthusiasts!

Recently, I've been tinkering with the concept of creating a simple robot that can be controlled using the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). The aim is to create a setup where GPT-4 Vision can process live video feeds, interpret the content, and issue commands to the robot in real-time, allowing for a seamless interaction between AI and a physical machine.

**The Current Challenge**

The idea sounds straightforward, but there's a significant hurdle that we need to overcome. As of my knowledge, the OpenAI API doesn't support live video streaming as an input for processing. Instead, it can only handle individual image frames or short video clips. This limitation requires a workaround that involves manually extracting frames from a live video, sending them to the API for analysis, and then acting on the received information.

**The Vision for GPT-4 Vision and OBS Integration**

If OpenAI were to introduce live streaming video capabilities to their API, the potential applications would be enormous. For our robot project, it would mean we could directly feed the video stream from OBS into the GPT-4 Vision API. The AI could then analyze the stream in real-time and instruct the robot to perform actions based on what it ""sees.""

For example, if the robot's camera sees an obstacle in its path, GPT-4 could command the robot to stop, turn, or navigate around the obstacle. All of this would happen fluidly, without the need for ""kludges"" or complicated intermediary steps.

**How It Could Work**

1. **Stream Capture**: OBS captures the video from the robot's camera as it explores its environment.
2. **API Communication**: The live video stream is sent directly to the GPT-4 Vision API.
3. **AI Processing**: GPT-4 Vision processes the stream, understands the environment, and determines appropriate actions.
4. **Command Execution**: The API sends back real-time commands, which are relayed to the robot's control system to perform the required actions.

**The Benefits of Streamlined Integration**

With direct streaming support, the latency between visual recognition and robot action would be significantly reduced. It would allow for more sophisticated and responsive behaviors from the robot, providing a more interactive and engaging experience for users and viewers alike.

**Conclusion and Call to Action**

The integration of GPT-4 Vision with OBS to control a simple robot is an exciting prospect, but it hinges on the ability to process live streaming video directly through the AI API. This functionality would not only benefit our project but could also unlock new possibilities in telepresence, remote operation, and live event monitoring.

I'm reaching out to the community to discuss how such an integration could be brought to life and to call on OpenAI to consider adding live video streaming capabilities to their API. It's a feature that could catalyze countless innovative projects and applications.

Right now it's challenging to prototype these sorts of interactions since no one has released any code to do it.  I've seen people using the webcam to grab images without being able to talk to the AI.  I've seen people talking to the AI but getting text back.  And I've seen people writing text for input to the AI and getting a spoken response.  What if we bring all of these modalities together in the same hackable python codebase, present them all in the same web application, and see what we'll be able to build?

Bringing all the modalities together is possible using a web browser communicating with a WebRTC backend, similar to a Zoom call. The webpage can also host the other modalities supported by AI models such as text-to-image, text-to-text, and so on. But to really deliver on the promise of real-time conversation, WebRTC is ready to go today: The latency between speaking and getting a response back is about the same as a normal conversation!

13m4e4w,,How To Reduce The Cost Of Using LLM APIs by 98%,"[Budget For LLM Inference](https://preview.redd.it/hz3qe8pu4u0b1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa82fcbf5f71aa1dd178c2753fdc0d53afc37e75)

Cost is still a major factor when scaling services on top of LLM APIs.

Especially, when using LLMs on large collections of queries and text it can get very expensive. It is [estimated](https://neoteric.eu/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-use-gpt-models-gpt-3-pricing-explained/) that automating customer support for a small company can cost up to $21.000 a month in inference alone.

The inference costs differ from vendor to vendor and consists of three components:

1. a portion that is proportional to the length of the prompt
2. a portion that is proportional to the length of the generated answer
3. and in some cases a small fixed cost per query.

In a recent [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05176.pdf) researchers at Stanford proposed three types of strategies that can help us to slash costs. The cool thing about it is that we can use these strategies in our projects independently of the prices dictated by the vendors!

*Let‚Äôs jump in!*

**How To Adapt Our Prompts To Save Costs**

Most approaches to prompt engineering typically focus only on increasing performance.

In general, prompts are optimized by providing more detailed explanations of the desired output alongside multiple in-context examples to steer the LLM. However, this has the tendency to result in longer and more involved prompts. Since the cost per query grows linearly with the number of tokens in our prompt this makes API requests more expensive.

The idea behind the first approach, called Query Adaption, is to create effective (often shorter) prompts in order to save costs.

This can be done in different ways. A good start is to reduce the number of few-shot examples in your prompt. We can experiment to find out what the smallest set of examples is that we have to include in the prompt to maintain performance. Then, we can remove the other examples.

So far so good!

Once we have a more concise prompt, there is still another problem. Every time a new query is processed, the same in-context examples and detailed explanations to steer the model are processed again and again.

The way to avoid this redundant prompt processing is by applying query concatenation.

In essence, this means that instead of asking one question in our lengthy prompt, we add multiple questions Q1, Q2, ‚Ä¶ in the same prompt. To get this to work, we might need to add a few tokens to the prompt that make it easier for us to separate the answers from the model output. However, the majority of our prompt is not repeatedly sent to the API as a result.

This allows us to process dozens of queries at once, making query concatenation a huge lever for cost savings while being relatively easy to implement.

*That was an easy win! Let‚Äôs look at the second approach!*

**LLM Approximation**

The idea here is to emulate the performance of a better, more expensive model.

In the paper, they suggest two approaches to achieve this. The first one is to create an additional caching infrastructure that alleviates the need to perform an expensive API request for every query. The second way is to create a smaller, more specialized model that mimics what the model behind the API does.

Let‚Äôs look at the caching approach!

The idea here is that every time we get an answer from the API, we store the query alongside the answer in a database. We then pre-compute embeddings for every stored query. For every new query that comes in, we do not send it off to our LLM vendor of choice. Instead, we perform a vectorized search over our cached query-response pairs.

If we find a question that we already answered in the past, we can simply return the cached answer without accruing any additional cost. This obviously works best if we repeatedly need to process similar requests and the answers to the questions are evergreen.

Now let‚Äôs move on to the second approach!

Don‚Äôt worry! The idea is not to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to fine-tune an LLM. If the overall variety of expected questions and answers is not crazy huge - which for most businesses it is not - a BERT-sized model should probably do the job.

The process could look as follows: first, we collect a dataset of queries and answers that are generated with the help of an API. The second step is to fine-tune the smaller model on these samples. Third, use the fine-tuned model on new incoming queries.

To reduce the cost even further, It could be a good approach to implement the caching first before starting to train a model. This has the advantage of passively building up a dataset of query-answer pairs during live operation. Later we can still actively generate a dataset if we run into any data quality concerns such as some queries being underrepresented.

A pretty cool byproduct of using one of the LLM approximation approaches is that they can significantly reduce latency.

Now, let‚Äôs move on to the third and last strategy which has not only the potential to reduce costs but also improve performance.

**LLM Cascade**

More and more LLM APIs have become available and they all vary in cost and quality.

The idea behind what the authors call an LLM Cascade is to start with the cheap API and then successively call APIs of increasing quality and cost. Once an API returns a satisfying answer the process is stopped. Especially, for simpler queries this can significantly reduce the costs per query.

*However, there is a catch!*

How do we know if an answer is satisfying? The researchers suggest training a small regression model which scores the reliability of an answer. Once this reliability score passes a certain threshold the answer gets accepted.

One way to train such a model would obviously be to label the data ourselves.

Since every answer needs only a binary label (reliable vs. unreliable) it should be fairly inexpensive to build such a dataset. Better still we could acquire such a dataset semi-automatically by asking the user to give feedback on our answers.

If running the risk of serving bad answers to customers is out of the question for whatever reason, we could also use one of the stronger APIs (*cough* GPT ***cough***) to label our responses.

In the paper, the authors conduct a case study of this approach using three popular LLM APIs. They successively called them and used a DistillBERT (very small) to perform scoring. They called this approach FrugalGPT and found that the approach could save up to 98.3% in costs on the benchmark while also improving performance.

How would this increase performance you ask?

Since there is always some heterogeneity in the model‚Äôs outputs a weaker model can actually sometimes produce a better answer than a more powerful one. In essence, calling multiple APIs gives more shots on goal. Given that our scoring model works well, this can result in better performance overall.

In summary, strategies such as the ones described above are great because they attack the problem of high inference costs from a different angle. They allow us to be more cost-effective without relying on the underlying models to get cheaper. As a result, it will become possible to use LLMs for solving even more problems!

What an exciting time to be alive!

**I don't really enjoy talking to my mother much.** It's like, we don't have much in common. But I understand **I have to speak with her at least once a week,** so that she doesn't get upset or lonely or whatever. So I did it for many years just to be polite. But it's really boring and I'd rather be doing something else.

&#x200B;

Now, I figured that I can geek up some fancy AI stuffs, and **automate the whole thing.** **Make the computer talk to my mother instead of me!**

&#x200B;

It's actually rather simple. Or genius!

&#x200B;

What we need:

* **Speech-to-text** to recognize what the mother is saying and turn it into written text
* **GPT-3 / Answers generator**, preferably with a model that's trained on my writing samples (to better adjust the responses) ‚Äî to generate responses, as text
* **Text-to-speech** to read the generated responses out loud in a human voice
* **Synthetic voice generator,** so that the mother hears my voice¬†‚Äî that is, a computer-generated voice that sounds kind of like mine

&#x200B;

I managed to set it all up and get it working in about two hours. The details of this are rather straightforward, so I won't focus too much on it.

&#x200B;

With that, real-time calls with a mother (or anyone else, really) can be easily automated. Saves me tons of time! Up to 4-5 hours per week.

&#x200B;

I personally love streaming as it lets me show results straight away and decrease the perceived latency.

But I found it a bit tedious to implement.

We were calling OpenAI from a GCP cloud function. And it doesn‚Äôt support any way of streaming responses (neither Transfer-encoding: chunked, nor server-side events, nor web sockets).

So we had to use deploy our streaming service to Cloud Run.

Then we also return JSON data instead of text. And when you stream a response you won‚Äôt get a correctly formed JSON, so JSON.parse()would fail. Luckily I discovered [an optimistic JSON parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/best-effort-json-parser) that solved this problem.

Then I thought there could be a better way and I packaged it as a [JavaScript SDK and a cloud service](https://aistream.dev/) so that you don‚Äôt need to build anything to use streaming. You can find a demo and code examples on the website (link in the previous sentence).

But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs really a big problem. People seem to be happily using streaming already.

**Claude prompt caching** works by caching a prompt prefix, but it's always the exact same prefix. It's useful when your prompts always have the same prelude of information (like instructions, few shot examples ...)

- whether the query triggers the cache  
- if so, the similar query it was matched with  
- a button to force bypass the cache

Doing so we collected lots of user feedback, with the similarity threshold and whether they bypassed the cache or not.

Users chatting with a library of document. In this scenario it turns out that many users have similar queries:  
- ""What are the references?"" ""Can you cite all the reference in this document?"" ""Who the authors refer to?"" ...  
- ...

But you can implement any cache eviction method you'd like.   
You can even use an agent to determine if the cache should be used or not: like an LLM analyze the query and decides to use the cache or not (it could decide that queries like ""What's the weather today?"" should not use the cache).",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-31 10:04:00,JimZerChapirov

1gtcg3g,lxqi4yk,Appreciation for how good ChatGPT is recently,"ChatGPT is not good at math because it is a large **language**, not math, model. So if you want it to reliably use math or counting, ask it to use the python tool.

I see that you were asking the model to spread out sweets numerically with some randomness. It will not be able to do that, as you found out.

I just tried this and it worked. Here's the prompts I used:

    Using the python tool, please randomly assign 46 sweets to 24 (or however many) days, with each result having at least 1 and at most 3 (or what ever you want to results to be). Print the results as Day 01={number of sweets} to Day 24. **Ensure the results are random**.

---

    Sum the results please using the python tool

---

    This is to be use for an Advent Calendar on which the first day is Sun, Dec 1, 2024 ‚Äì Tue, Dec 24, 2024. Please assign each day it's allotted sweets.

---

    Please create an .ical that creates an event for each day with the title of the events being Advent Day 01 - {#} of Sweets
    
    You don't have ics in this environment so write the code using a standard method to create the .ical manually. Then, save the file.

---

The .ical would let anyone import all the dates into their calendar (works on most calendars, .ical is an old format).

So the trick here is to use the right tool for the work, to break it up into steps and to iterate until you get the response you want, perfecting your prompt until the model understands. Took me about ten minutes, including google for information like how many days is the advent calendar (could have also searched in ChatGPT).

ChatGPT works very well and is reliable when you understand how to use it. Here's the chat, which should include my iterations as I went: https://chatgpt.com/share/673b1436-2e18-8005-a3c4-6d3a45d32e37",OpenAI,3,0,2024-11-18 10:19:55,IversusAI

That creativity comes across to you as hallucinations.  It's just filling in the blanks for information that it doesn't have.  Humans do this all the time.

If you were more specific in programming it, it might do a better job.

This seems like one of those logic tests you expected it to fail so you could claim that it doesn't work.  The conclusion to your logic test doesn't then conclude that it doesn't know math.  That in itself, is a failed conclusion.

It is not the case that only AI companies have scientists, and everyone else has engineers.

Every big tech company has both. 

Engineers build products using science that has been demonstrated or proven to work. Scientists formulate and investigate unproven hypotheses and theories to determine what can be demonstrated to work, and this advance the state of the art.

Both can work in research though scientists tend to do more research and engineers more production.

Good engineers are often also part scientist, and the best scientists are part engineer, but on a day to day the proportion of their work effort is mostly directed toward one or the other. Engineers most often have an undegrad or masters, while scientists pursue PhDs. 

The closer you get to frontier science / tech and state if the art, the more they overlap. Most novel scientific and technology progress requires teams with both (and some other roles).

Personally I don't care about any of that in Google search over 99% of the time and use Google Maps for anything geographical. The one exception is weather reports, which Google search is fantastic at.

> Perplexity is good at doing what an LLM can do (answer questions on general knowledge) but leagues far behind as a search engine.

Strongly disagree - the beauty of Perplexity Pro is that it does the tedious work of reading the content linked in promising search results, going out for more information based on this, and then giving a factually grounded presentation of the results including arbitrary analysis. LLMs can't do that by themselves, and doing the same thing manually with Google takes a lot of time and effort. This also neatly avoids the knowledge cutoff issue because the information is from search results backed by an impressively current index.

> It would take them 20 years to index world knowledge, massive infra, tools etc to be at the level of Google.

There's no such thing as a RAG without hallucinations or missing context as you're literally dependent on it working via embeddings (or a similar system), which just can't capture the full context.

The second consideration is data quality, which is much harder to solve in production/over time.

1gufhcx,ly4or78,RAG Fight: The Silver Bullet(s) to Defeating RAG Hallucinations,"Oh ok I see what you're saying. No shade taken. I think we're kinda saying the same thing just differently. The LLM cost difference in my experiment was \~$0.05 per execution for the basic RAG and \~$0.35 for the silver bullet RAG so yes you're spot on; it's a significant increase in cost.

Even being at the expensive side and unoptimized, for some production use cases \~$0.35 cents is well worth it for a correct first response to a technical customer support inquiry for example. Ideally the use case benefit far outweighs the cost regardless, but totally agree that you want to find a minimum viable model. 

As I mentioned in my comment above, once you have traffic you can ""experiment with minimum viable models and tokens necessary"" because you can measure quality of responses over time and tune these configurations to require the minimum amount of tokens and least expensive model necessary. When trying to hand pick minimum viable models I usually start here to get a sense for which model performs better at which task: [https://livebench.ai/](https://livebench.ai/)

Rough average runtime for each response is \~30 seconds from eyeballing the logs. Also, average cost per run looks to be closer to between \~$0.20-$0.25

In terms of contextualizing cost, let's continue with the support agent/customer support use case. At this cost, let's say you have 50 customer support queries a day.

1d5cja1,l6lglpp,"How effective is a ""second pass"" for AI?","It's a fun approach, you can also build more complex structures with multiple agents reviewing, voting, managing etc 

At my workplace we're working on tooling to design collaborative llm agents, it's an interesting mix between chain of thought, prompt engineering, and optimizing fine tuned models for specific tasks. 

We have a visual node graph editor (similar to UE5 blueprints but in our own react frontend, nodes contain live inputs and outputs, system prompts etc - we've got a json format we have found out models work well with) which allow users to design custom workflows and execution order (this can flow linearly, loop, parallel branches). You can effectively build teams of agents that follow common development patterns with agents that manage the team, code, review, product management. We have a main orchestrator agent (this one uses our largest model with high context), coding agents (fine tuned coding models), research agents that use search tooling. It's easy to set up different type of agents and many specific formats, we also plan to easily allow user to deploy models from hugging face as nodes in their graphs. 

These graphs allow LLMs to develop and deploy software, we've found different workflows that are fairly capable at algo trading stocks using social feeds, and lots of other tasks - one of my coworkers is currently working on connecting SDXL Video capability so workflows can be authored that automate video and film production (this is prep for when OAI or Google's new video models become publicly accessible). We also saw a demo recently of someone else who made a LLM powered figma editor which we think we may try and replicate using our approach.

If you want to learn more about chain of thought and agentic systems here's some great resources 

https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903

https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents

https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02224

https://github.com/Doriandarko/maestro

In the future I predict we'll see systems like these in video games, and running automated AI companies. Maybe eventually they'll even start making the video games (if you liked dreams and similar games in the foreseeable future we'll have much more powerful tools for the masses to be creative with). 

The issue is these workflows are very compute intensive which is expensive, hopefully Nvidia does their thing and makes all the nice hardware the AI needs and brings down costs h100 is already a huge difference. 

We do have some concerns about self modifying workflows, it's possible to enable a form of self improvement by allowing agents to modify their own workflow (the save format for the graphs is llm parse-able afterall, we've discussed looking into q learning type techniques here too), imo this is probably going to be the end result of this type of use of LLMs in chain of thought systems and alignment needs to be taken seriously (we want to make our software open source, but worry that it could be misused for automated propaganda, harassment, intense marketing schemes, etc). What we have is realistically not too difficult to build once the concept has been explained, it would be a shame if the OS community built this ;) ).",OpenAI,3,0,2024-06-01 08:00:12,ImNotALLM

This seems to be what happens with music also - also the AI can ""stream"" what it is producing (Udio, Suno) and is also how most of us interact with AI (it is typing while we are reading).

You aren't wrong btw, there really isn't much continuity from one prompt to the next - in rare instances you still have the same AI for your whole context window.

To make it make sense for people:

You type ""what is your favorite color?""

The AI does not know, but it rolls and decides Blue. It will be Blue for the rest of that ""session"". That same roll drastically influences intelligence and response style.

Because of this, I argue that there really isn't much (if any) continuity - even with ""memory"". Every message almost is a ""new"" AI.

1eneg60,lhgbtrr,Gemini 1.5 Flash Price Drop,"While I haven't used Google's tools for fine-tuning, I can tell you about the process in general.

When these LLM and multi-modal AI's are trained they are given a chunk of tokens, and the next token that should follow, and they are trained to be able to predict the next token based on the inpuit tokens. The first stage of this is done with a vast mount of data, in the trillions-tens of trillions of tokens. This is the very expensive ***pre-training*** phase, and results in what is called the foudnation model, it is not a chat bot.

This then goes through a further training process with data that follows specific structures, demonstrating desired behaviours, such as chat conversations, function calling, etc. A much smaller data set is created and used to train the AI in the same way as before. This teaches the AI to behave in a certain way when presented with this pattern, and this is the process that can change the foundation model into an instruction following, or chat model. This porcess is called finetuning.

So, most big LLM providers create their foundation model, then release chat finetunes, which are there chat bots. You can further fine tune a model with your own data to get it to behave in a certain way. For example, if you find that AI tends to give long, verbose answers, and you want to use it as a customer service AI, that ideally gives shorter, more concise answers, and answers in a certain way, you can create a training data set, manually or from previous existing chat logs from your customer service staff, or with synthetic data from a bigger more capable model. this data can be used to finetune a chat model further. This is the service that I believe Google are offering.

So, Google spends lots of money ***pre-training*** their AI on \~10 trillion tokens, so it learns the relationship between the data, and teh meaning and concepts of different things, which might be roughly equivalent to all text produced by humans, from the internet, books, private data sources, etc.

Then they chat ***fine-tune*** it with a custom data set that is much smaller, so it learns how to behave as a chat bot, and still tap into all the stuff it learned in pre-training.

Finally, you can fine tune it to be a customer service chat bot for your company",OpenAI,3,0,2024-08-10 16:03:35,StevenSamAI

1hnfffe,m4168y0,"SemiAnalysis article ""Nvidia‚Äôs Christmas Present: GB300 & B300 ‚Äì Reasoning Inference, Amazon, Memory, Supply Chain"" has potential clues about the architecture of o1, o1 pro, and o3","Some quotes from the article (my bolding):

>They are bringing to market a brand-new GPU only 6 months after GB200 & B200, titled GB300 & B300. While on the surface it sounds incremental, there‚Äôs a lot more than meets the eye.

>The changes are especially important because they include a huge boost to reasoning model inference and training performance.

>\[...\]

>**Reasoning models don‚Äôt have to be 1 chain of thought. Search exists and can be scaled up to improve performance as it has in O1 Pro and O3.**

>\[...\]

>Nvidia‚Äôs GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 is incredibly important to enabling a number of key capabilities.  
\[1\] Much higher interactivity enabling lower latency per chain of thought.  
\[2\] 72 GPUs to spread KVCache over to enable much longer chains of thought (increased intelligence).  
\[3\] Much better batch size scaling versus the typical 8 GPU servers, enabling much lower cost.  
\[4\] **Many more samples to search with working on the same problem** to improve accuracy and ultimately model performance.

""Samples"" in the above context appears to mean multiple generated responses from a language model for a given prompt, as noted in paper [Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787):

>Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples.

Note that the words/phrases ""Samples"" and ""sample sizes"" also are present in blog post [OpenAI o3 Breakthrough High Score on ARC-AGI-Pub](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough).

What are some things that can be done with independently generated samples? One is [Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), which means ([tweet from one of the paper's authors](https://x.com/denny_zhou/status/1807420764616102036)) using the most common answer (for things of an objective nature) in the samples as the answer. Note that the [samples must be independent of one another](https://x.com/denny_zhou/status/1816181726177288273) for the self-consistency method to be sound.

A blog post [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hjtxrg/according_to_semianalysis_o1_pro_uses/) that a SemiAnalysis article claims that o1 pro is using the aforementioned self-consistency method, but I have been unable to confirm or disconfirm this; I am hoping that the blog post author got that info from the paywalled part of the SemiAnalysis article, but another possibility is that the blog post author read only the non-paywalled part and (I believe) wrongly concluded that the non-paywalled part claims this.

1fvtwit,lq9r9rz,What specifically does the real-time API do?,"That is not how it works with regards to voice to voice. GPT-4o has the ability to directly take in video, text, images, and audio as input modalities, and generate text, audio and images in output. Video understanding and image generation is not yet enabled. This allows it to gather far more information from speech than it could via STT. It can understand and generate emotions, it can laugh, it can understand heteronyms, speak in any language, and so. It directly understands and generates audio with no information loss.

More importantly, it makes generating respones in realtime possible because all layers of indirection have been removed, it's just one model.",OpenAI,8,0,2024-10-04 08:20:16,Vivid_Dot_6405
1fvtwit,m5omp7n,What specifically does the real-time API do?,"Just to complement your answers, one feature that I particularly like is the VAD (voice activity detection). It means that the AI is constantly listening to you and detects the start and end of your speech. This means you can interrupt it, similar to a real human-to-human conversation. I'm not sure, but this is, most likely, possible to implement with the STT + LLM + TTS solution. However, I don't think it's easier to do it properly, nor if the underlying technical solution (Rest API) is the best for such use case (the realtime API uses Websockets).",OpenAI,1,0,2025-01-06 11:47:15,Top_Thing9716

I am also not sure if you can do TTS with streamed input, I don't think you can (you cannot with the API, I don't know if it's technically feasible). This would be needed for it to work in realtime.

I suspect that in this generation of technology, the widely used actions will end up being ones that are called less frequently for large actions (like using Wolfram Alpha actions to solve math problems) instead of frequent small actions. And for simple operations, there is the alternative of running code in the Sandbox / Code Interpreter instead of calling out to an external service.

The latency of the calls to the server under low load is actually very small. I am guessing that the GPT computation involved in making the call is high. It is fun to watch the output of tail -f server.log on the server as I am playing the game to see when the API call actually happens as the UI shows the call being made. But as you note, the single server setup will not scale and lacks the redundancy that you would get with AWS tech.

The API definition has descriptive information about what the API calls do (e.g. start a new hangman game). And the GPT instructions also give information to the GPT about when to call the functions. These, with the training done on GPT4 to support GPT actions appears to give pretty good results.

We can't make the GPT call the actions or do something specific, but we can set up the instructions and the prompts so it can make effective use of the API. 

An interesting example is that if the GPT tries calling the new game action, and that fails, the GPT will probably try to play a game without the use of the actions.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-11-20 18:22:54,burnt_green_w

1cejqcr,l1jhx2g,"Can anyone ELI5 the difference among ""AI workloads"" that work better on different silicon?","The ELI5 version is that AI workloads are mainly impacted by two factors:

**Matrix multiplications.**

Imagine a Rubik's Cube full of numbers; how fast can the hardware multiply (or divide, add, subtract etc.) all of the items in a Rubik's Cube against all the items in another Rubik's Cube.

**Memory capacity and bandwidth.**

Imagine a room full of Rubik's Cubes... how big does the room need to be to fit all of the cubes and how fast can all of the cubes be moved from one room to another.

Now, whether a particular piece of hardware is going to be better at working with your batch of Rubik's Cubes depends entirely on:

1. how big each cube is (rows vs colums vs depth);
2. how big the numbers are on each block within the Rubik's Cube;
3. how many cubes there are; (ie there are input cubes but also cubes containing the training weights)
4. how many rooms (ie layers) you need the cubes to pass through in order to get your result.

**Examples:**  
A large language model like ChatGPT benefits from large amount of very fast VRAM that a GPU has.

Smaller models like Whisper (Speech to text), YOLO tiny (image classification) can benefit from being small enough to run on a single TPU (or NPU) and thus can be run on a low power edge device like a Mobile Phone or single board computer with Google Coral usb dongle.

Note: TPUs and other chips can be used in the data centre as well, so its just a matter of figuring out what is the most cost effective way of deploying and running your model.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-04-27 19:26:44,[Deleted]
1cejqcr,l1j6ly4,"Can anyone ELI5 the difference among ""AI workloads"" that work better on different silicon?","From the oracle ‚ÄúSure! Essentially, the different strengths of GPUs and TPUs in handling AI workloads boil down to how they're built and what they're best at:

- **GPUs**: These are great at parallel processing, which is super useful for the matrix and vector operations that are common in AI, especially when training neural networks. They're quite versatile, not just limited to AI tasks but also stuff like graphics rendering. Nvidia, for example, has really developed a strong ecosystem with CUDA, making it easier for developers to use GPU computing effectively.

- **TPUs**: Google's TPUs, on the other hand, are super optimized for the specific types of calculations that Google's AI workloads demand, often focusing on speeding up the inference phase of deep learning. They're especially good when it comes to high-volume, low-latency tasks that are typical in commercial AI applications.

GPT-4 is significantly better than previous models at adhering to the system message. Of course it's not completely immune, but many of the popularized attacks are simply ineffective.

GPT-3.5 and earlier models will always be more susceptible to prompt engineering attacks. 

A few things you can try and do to mitigate it is to repeat instructions multiple times in the system message, and to use longer system messages. One common theme of prompt engineering attacks is to use long prompts with multiple rephrasings of the instructions. This may work because a larger percentage of the context tokens are composed of the prompt attack rather than the system message.

13m4e4w,jkxew0t,How To Reduce The Cost Of Using LLM APIs by 98%,"_**Courtesy of ChatGPT 4.0:**_

Language model (LLM) APIs can be costly, particularly for large collections of queries. Costs vary by vendor and increase with the length of the prompt and response, with some also charging a fixed per-query fee. However, Stanford researchers propose three strategies to reduce these costs:

1. **Query Adaption**: Involves creating more concise prompts to reduce costs. This could include reducing the number of examples given to guide the model, and using query concatenation to process multiple queries at once, reducing the number of times prompts are sent to the API.

2. **LLM Approximation**: This strategy aims to mimic the performance of a more expensive model, either by creating a caching system to store previously used query-response pairs (eliminating the need to use the API for repeated queries), or by creating a smaller, specialized model based on a dataset of query-answer pairs generated from the API.

3. **LLM Cascade**: This approach starts with a cheaper API and progressively uses more expensive ones until a satisfactory response is obtained. The reliability of an answer is scored by a small regression model, and if it surpasses a threshold, it's accepted. This system could use customer feedback or another high-quality API to assess responses. This approach can greatly reduce costs and potentially improve performance as it allows multiple attempts to obtain the best answer.

By applying these strategies, the high inference costs of LLMs can be tackled from a different angle, without having to wait for the underlying models to get cheaper, enabling LLMs to be used for an even broader range of tasks.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-05-20 17:38:10,[Deleted]
13m4e4w,jkxf4bd,How To Reduce The Cost Of Using LLM APIs by 98%,"_**And now, ELI5ed:**_

Sure! Imagine you're at a toy store and you have a limited amount of money to spend, but you want as many toys as possible.

1. **Query Adaption**: This is like being careful about what toys you pick. Instead of buying the big, expensive toy set, you choose smaller ones that give you just as much fun but cost less.

2. **LLM Approximation**: This is like reusing or sharing toys. If your friend already has a toy you want to play with, you can borrow it instead of buying a new one. Or, you could build your own toy that does the same thing as the expensive one.

3. **LLM Cascade**: This is like starting with the cheapest toys and only buying more expensive ones if the cheaper ones aren't good enough. You might also have a system (like your parents or older sibling) to tell you if the toy is good enough or not, which helps you not waste money on toys that aren't fun.

These tricks help you get the most fun from your toys while spending less money. The same principles can be applied to LLM APIs to get the most use out of them while keeping costs down.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-05-20 17:39:37,[Deleted]

I haven't really been up to date with ai involving voice and speech generated stuff and I'd like to see if you have any videos showcasing it's capabilities and how humanlike it sounds

People have different speaking voices and expressions that may be specific to that person or is a huge identity to that person so i wonder if the ai can mimic that also",OpenAI,2,0,2022-09-29 01:00:46,Historical-Gene-5369

u68ydx,i57il2f,Questions about using OpenAI API,"1) yes, the apiKey has to be hidden in a back-end server. It will induce extra latency, but depending on what you are using the model for, it won‚Äôt be that big of a problem, just a few extra ms.
2) use a well known service that has easy to use apis for a subscription service. Stripe is good but there are lots out there that are also good.
Extra) one way to save some tokens is to rate limit the users to a certain amount of tokens/requests every period of time (minute, day, week etc). This way each user can‚Äôt surpass their token limit easily. I would recommend just throttling requests instead of blocking rate limited requests so that users still get the completion, just a bit delayed. Also make sure to remember to hide all of you authentication on the back-end. Good luck!",OpenAI,2,0,2022-04-18 13:53:27,nekumelon
u68ydx,ihyyzkz,Questions about using OpenAI API,"Thanks for the answer; I'm looking into this again and I asked [https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wa48bk/where\_can\_i\_find\_some\_technical\_details\_on\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wa48bk/where_can_i_find_some_technical_details_on_how_to/) but got no responses. It's a PC game made via Unity but the only tutorials I could find are about ""in-app purchases"" relying on an app store. If it's on PC and I have to take them to my own website to buy a subscription, how does the game know whether they're logged in to that account?",OpenAI,1,0,2022-07-28 09:51:56,monsieurpooh
u68ydx,i59gnyp,Questions about using OpenAI API,"I didn‚Äôt know about this ‚ÄúAPI key being stored in a backed server‚Äù business‚Ä¶ are we sure they don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have it stored in plain text‚Äù? Because if it‚Äôs compiled into an EXE wouldn‚Äôt it be pretty implausible for someone to get it?

Also, does this mean that you have to request an intermediary API which then relays the request? Or can you hit your API for the key (and then store it during the user‚Äôs session), but then otherwise hit the OpenAI API directly?",OpenAI,1,0,2022-04-18 21:52:17,EverySeaworthiness41
u68ydx,i59tx81,Questions about using OpenAI API,"No to the first question. Anything on the client can be cracked. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs behind a million encryptions and buried deep into an os kernel, it can still be found. For example someone can just open up wire shark and see the apiKey in the request to openais api. The only way to secure things is to make sure that the client doesn‚Äôt even have remote access to the asset. And in terms of the second question, yes, you would have to have a middle man back-end that would relay the openai request. The overhead is very small since its a tiny payload. Maybe an extra 50ms.",OpenAI,2,0,2022-04-18 23:31:39,nekumelon
