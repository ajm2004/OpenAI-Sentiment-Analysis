1hdbhaz,,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"It’s been a week since the o1 came out, and the hype is starting to settle.

People are split on whether it’s actually useful or just another dud release from OpenAI. So, I tested the model in multiple categories, such as math, coding, and writing. The tasks o1-preview failed to solve, and I also compared it with the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

For full analysis, check out this blog post: [OpenAI o1 vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://composio.dev/blog/openai-o1-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet/)

Here are some key insights:

* o1 full is a genuine step up from the o1-preview on maths and reasoning. It solved the questions that the o1-preview failed to do.
* Contrary to the benchmark result shared in the system card, in my limited uses, o1 felt better than the Preview in coding.
* Creative writing has significantly improved.
* 50 messages/week is an absolute deal breaker, but I use it with 4o in tandem for optimal usage.

# How does it compare to Claude?

* o1 wins in math and reasoning; it’s not even close.
* Claude is still king for coding.
* Claude has more personality and feels close to talking to a real person.
* o1 feels like a high-IQ yes-guy intern. I would have liked it better if it was a bit less agreeable.

# Which one to pick?

* If you need models exclusively for coding, Claude offers better value.
* For math, reasoning, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive, consider ChatGPT, but keep an eye on the per-week quota.

Let me know your thoughts on it and which one you liked more from your experience.",OpenAI,112,37,2024-12-13 12:49:22,SunilKumarDash

1dscub9,,"Okay yes, Claude is better than ChatGPT for now","Been a ChatGPT pro user since atleast 7 months. Been using it every single day for coding and other business tasks. I feel a bit sad to say that it has lost is charm to a certain extent. It's not as powerful as I feel Claude is right now. I was not quickly impressed by the claims people were making about Claude but then I went ahead created an account and gave it a couple of problems ChatGPT was struggling with and it handled it with expertise which I instantly felt. Kept using it for a while and for the problems ChatGPT 4o was behaving like 3.5, it gave me solutions which were grounded and clear. Debugging is much more robust with Sonnet.

I hope ChatGPT gets its grip back as it has got more incentives for pro users but since last two days Claude helped me save a couple of hours. I have begun thinking about migration, atleast for a time being. Or keep pro for both tools.

Wanted to put it out there.

Edit: I just subscribed to Claude Pro. Keeping both subscriptions for now. I have a couple of ongoing projects and I believe I have a use case for both. With the limits removed, I have worked on Claude more than ChatGPT, it's not been too long though, around an hour.

I may edit this post again in near future with my findings and for others to decide.

Edit: January 23rd, 2025.

It's been seven months since I first posted, which seems to rank high for Claude vs ChatGPT searches. I wanted to update on my journey as promised.

After switching from ChatGPT to Claude, I never looked back. My entire coding workflow shifted to Claude, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I started with Claude Chat directly, but when Cursor emerged, I tried it and found it to be the most efficient way to code using Sonnet. These days, I no longer maintain a Claude subscription and exclusively use Cursor.

I only resubscribed to ChatGPT last month for real-time voice chat (language learning). I still use it for basic tasks like grammar checks and searches - essentially as a replacement for Google and as a general AI assistant - but never for coding anymore.

For those finding this through Google: it's now well-established in the dev community that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most capable and intelligent coding LLM. Cursor's initial popularity was tied to Claude, but it has evolved into a powerful IDE with features like agent composer and much more.

For non-coders: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is, in my opinion, a far more intelligent and precise tool than GPT-4o and even o1. While I can't list all examples here, for every single non-coding task I've given it, I've received more refined, crafted, and precise responses.

This shift was a game-changer for my productivity and business gains. To tech founders and small teams building products: unless ChatGPT specifically fits your coding needs, consider switching to Cursor. It has literally transformed my business and boosted profits significantly. Grateful to the Claude team for their work.",OpenAI,498,255,2024-06-30 22:02:53,speakthat
18u0x0t,,ChatGPT(GPT-4) vs GitHub Copilot?,"I'm curious to hear from the experience of those that do lots of code generation how their experience compares between using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot?

The reason I ask is as other posts have mentioned ChatGPT's code generation seems to have regressed in some ways. I saw a user mention that they created an assistant using an older version of GPT-4 from the API and it resolved their issues. I'm tempted to do this too but before I go build my own interface for it I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how Copilot currently stacks up? I use it in my VSCode but more as a good auto complete for simple stuff vs the full chat experience

Any input is appreciated!

Bonus: has anyone moved entirely to a different model for their code generation? Last I tried Claude 2 and Bard-Gemini-Pro seemed to still fall short of GPT-4, even with the regression.",OpenAI,150,153,2023-12-29 23:37:21,BoiElroy
17j9aoj,,GPT-4 VS Claude 2 for real world users.,"so i got GPT-4 last month and i honestly feel pretty underwhelmed. sure it does some things better than claude and gpt-3.5 but it feels really unintuitive while doing so. heres some examples on how its features feel for a non software developer.

1. plugin mode is gimmicky at best unless you want GPT to make you a graph or something.
2. browsing mode is only useful in limited circumstances as the bot cant parse which information is important and tends to read and regurgitate swaths of generic information over specialized information thats needed. (ask it to help you diagnose a cooling system of a specific vehicle and the information you get back is of generic vehicle cooling systems with unrelated parts and suggestions. seems limited to simpler things like checking the weather forecast)
3. Dalle-3 mode is admittedly pretty cool but it loves to censor the most mundane things frustratingly. (i tried generic product prototype sketches for a medical kit and it refused to produce some images based on the kits contents.)
4. voice mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but wont work with browsing so is very limited compared to something like alexa or siri. unlike those services you cant exactly ask it to look something up for you or do something for you.
5. its ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is severely lacking compared to claude 2. claude has the ability to read data related images and graphs from PDF documents at a glance. GPT-4 falters in this area even though it has image recognition capabilities from directly uploaded images and is decent with making guesses on makes and models of vehicles.

an example of how obtuse GPT-4 can be compared to claude:

1fhjfln,,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take 

The past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs 

Verdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model 

I am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. 

The project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. 

✅ o1-mini pros 
- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done
- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot
- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. 
- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this 

❎o1-mini cons
- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. 
- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues
- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a ""conversational"" LLM due to long thinking time 
- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. 
- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly 
- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either
- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. 

✨ o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions 
- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot 
- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the 👑 of closed source coding LLM
- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet

1i3pwjq,,o1 is best at bugs,"I tend to use Claude's Projects instead of ChatGpt's because Claude's Projects allows more than 20 attachments, and Claude is pretty good at handling scattered context. However, it sometimes gets flummoxed on some issue that it just can't get around at which point I bring out o1. I've had 5+ issues where Claude (or 4o, or Gemini) couldn't figure it out, but o1 nailed it. o1 even helped me figure out the proper VS Code config and vite.config.js settings to set breakpoints in JSX code, where Claude, ChatGpt 4o, and VS Code Copilot (shame! shame!) all failed.  Last night when Claude hit me with a message limit reached, imposing a 90 minute cooldown (which only happened because I was furiously resubmitting tweaked prompts in hopes that Claude would fix a pesky bug that it itself had introduced somewhere deep in the bowels of the UI code) — fortunately o1 came to the rescue.

The results were surprising, and I wanted to share my findings with the community.

Testing Methodology I ran both models through identical scenarios, focusing on real-world applications rather than just benchmarks. Each test was repeated multiple times to ensure consistency.

Key Findings

1. Complex Reasoning \* Winner: o1 Pro (but the margin is smaller than you'd expect) \* Takes 20-30 seconds longer for responses \* Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieves 90% accuracy in significantly less time
2. Code Generation \* Winner: Claude Sonnet 3.5 \* Cleaner, more maintainable code \* Better documentation \* o1 Pro tends to overengineer solutions
3. Advanced Mathematics \* Winner: o1 Pro \* Excels at PhD-level problems \* Claude Sonnet 3.5 handles 95% of practical math tasks perfectly
4. Vision Analysis \* Winner: o1 Pro \* Detailed image interpretation \* Claude Sonnet 3.5 doesn't have advanced vision capabilities yet
5. Scientific Reasoning \* Tie \* o1 Pro: deeper analysis \* Claude Sonnet 3.5: clearer explanations

Value Proposition Breakdown

o1 Pro ($200/month): \* Superior at PhD-level tasks \* Vision capabilities \* Deeper reasoning \* That extra 5-10% accuracy in complex tasks

Claude Sonnet 3.5 ($20/month): \* Faster responses \* More consistent performance \* Superior coding assistance \* Handles 90-95% of tasks just as well

Interesting Observations \* The response time difference is noticeable - o1 Pro often takes 20-30 seconds to ""think"" \* Claude Sonnet 3.5's coding abilities are surprisingly superior \* The price-to-performance ratio heavily favors Claude Sonnet 3.5 for most use cases

Should You Pay 10x More?

For most users, probably not. Here's why:

1. The performance gap isn't nearly as wide as the price difference
2. Claude Sonnet 3.5 handles most practical tasks exceptionally well
3. The extra capabilities of o1 Pro are mainly beneficial for specialized academic or research work

Who Should Use Each Model?

Choose o1 Pro if: \* You need vision capabilities \* You work with PhD-level mathematical/scientific content \* That extra 5-10% accuracy is crucial for your work \* Budget isn't a primary concern

Choose Claude Sonnet 3.5 if: \* You need reliable, fast responses \* You do a lot of coding \* You want the best value for money \* You need clear, practical solutions

Unless you specifically need vision capabilities or that extra 5-10% accuracy for specialized tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 at $20/month provides better value for most users than o1 Pro at $200/month.",OpenAI,3177,525,2024-12-06 14:36:02,Kakachia777
1h76ek0,,Framework for Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence,"Current discussions about AGI often get bogged down in abstract definitions and theoretical debates, rather than focusing on practical, real-world applications. As a thought experiment and with the help of Claude and ChatGPT, I've created a framework to explore what really matters: can an AGI system create meaningful solutions, teach effectively, and implement sustainable changes in the real world, while also maintaining ethical standards and adapting to different cultural contexts? I thought this would be a valuable starting point for inspiration and discussion.

The correct answer is ""No"". In fact, Small-Cap growth companies have been shown to perform *negatively* over long time periods, and there's sufficient evidence to support this, and has been for some time.

At dinner we decided to try and play a game with chatGPT first then moved on to other AIs. A 10 year old can do well at a game like this. Here was my general prompt: Let’s play a game. You think of a word in a category and kind of like hangman where we pass the phone around and each person gets to guess the letter. As we guess show the letters we have guessed already. There are three players. Can you also say how many letters each word is at the beginning of a round.

ChatGPT 4o model which knows basically every word in most languages will straight up make up gibberish words or drastically misspell a word or not have it’s misspelled word fit a category. Using model o1 it did better but not every time. Also to note ChatGPT was self aware that the word did not make sense and it would say so at the end of a round when the revealed word did not make sense.

Gemini started out good but as soon as we went to guess the first letter it decided to tell us all about the first letter instead of playing the game… rinse repeat.

Copilot (probably using Open AI back end) played the game but horribly misspelled the word too which is kind of opposite of the goal of the game.

Claude same type of issue it makes up a word that is not real. 

Such a simple game that children play but advanced AIs have issues playing the game successfully. Please keep this in mind as we ask AI to do all sorts of things. To note I use AI a lot and notice where it does well and not so well so this one surprised me given the nature of the game. ",OpenAI,0,29,2024-12-28 00:23:50,Thought_Coffee
1dsyfh7,,"ChatGPT has a lot of features compared to Claude, but I still switched to Claude…","I want the LLM to help me parse information and turn it into insights, usable code and publishable documents. ChatGPT has a lot of features, but I have found most of them rather irrelevant:

1.	⁠I don’t use the code interpreter tool, because it’s limited (no internet connection, limited execution time and resources). I just make it write Python code blocks and run them myself on google colab or locally. This is a much more flexible and powerful workflow.
2.	⁠I don’t use the internet browsing, because I can find and curate relevant information in much better ways (looking for papers, textbooks, looking for tutorials, looking at documentation pages, stackoverflow, github, reddit, etc.) then pasting or uploading that to the LLM interface.
3.	⁠I don’t use GPTs or custom instrunctions or memory. I like to prompt and upload files to curate my own context each time, since I’m always facing novel tasks and trying out new things. Using GPTs from the store is rather opaque, since you cannot see or edit their full context. Building my own GPTs could work, but the design and interface does not seem aligned to my workflow. It seems to be centered around the idea of the GPT store, which I don’t really think makes sense. Meanwhile, the projects feature from Claude is much more aligned with how I want to use documents along an LLM: Basically creating a workspace filled with general information shared among different chats, then more specific information on each chat. Gemini 1.5 API on google ai studio and LM notebook are also great for this with their 1-2 million tokens context windows. GPT-4o on chatGPT with just 32k context pales in comparison.
4. I don’t really use image generation often other than for fun, which became quite less fun after after they heavily limited the rates at which it generates (1 picture at a time instead of 4). When I need to use it for a project I found the Dalle API much more useful (much more expensive though).

Overall, I have found that raw model intelligence and context window size (200k on Sonnet 3.5) are much more important than having a bunch of features which are not really that useful. Now that Claude is as smart, or even superior to GPT-4o, plus it’s new interface with prompt editing, artifacts and projects…. It’s clear to me that Claude is the best product for my use cases (coding, learning, research, writing papers).",OpenAI,89,47,2024-07-01 17:15:04,bot_exe

1ibe3n7,,DeepSeek AI Agents vs. ChatGPT: openAI still better??,"I’ve been diving into different AI APIs recently and came across DeepSeek AI agents, which seem to be an interesting alternative to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is widely used and well-documented, DeepSeek introduces some unique claims that got me curious—especially around API performance, customization, and use cases.

Here are some aspects of DeepSeek I found worth exploring:

1. Performance Claims: Documentation mentions sub-500ms response times, even for complex tasks. Anyone validated this in real-world use?


2. Pricing: The token-based pricing model seems 20–30% cheaper than GPT-4’s API, which could matter for high-volume users.


3. Context Handling: Offers extended or unlimited context windows when self-hosting. I’m wondering how practical this is for heavy workflows.


4. Pre-Built Agents: Includes tools designed for coding, data analysis, and research. Has anyone tested how effective these are out of the box?


5. Stateful Workflows: Features memory management for multi-step interactions. This could be helpful for developers building conversational apps or automations.



For context, I’ve been comparing these to OpenAI’s APIs, which excel in areas like:

A large ecosystem (e.g., plugins, third-party integrations)

Robustness for creative tasks like storytelling

Well-defined safety guardrails for sensitive applications


That said, here are some questions for discussion:

1. Have you tested DeepSeek in production environments? How does it handle scale and reliability?


2. How does its code generation compare to ChatGPT’s tools like the Code Interpreter?


3. Is the pricing difference meaningful for your projects?


4. Are there any trade-offs, like regional access, support quality, or rate limits?



I’ll share some of my own observations in the comments, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s worked with these APIs. Are these new players like DeepSeek serious contenders in the LLM space, or are they still catching up to the incumbents?

Google, with Gemini, and Amazon, with Claude, are backed by companies with net revenues in 2024 sitting at **$60 billion (Google)** and **$25 billion (Amazon)** compared to **OpenAI’s entire revenue, which is estimated to be around $3.6 billion** (and that’s not even NET profit, people).

OpenAI was born as a non-profit, operating under a mission-driven ethos. Its roots are not in maximising shareholder profit, unlike the tech giants it’s constantly compared to. Let’s call this what it is: a false equivalence. Sure, criticize OpenAI, but don’t pretend this is some apples-to-apples comparison. Google and Amazon can pour billions into their AI projects without blinking. OpenAI, meanwhile, is still proving that it can sustain itself in a fiercely competitive environment.

The cherry on top? Google and Amazon offer their models “free,” which is only possible because their core businesses rake in cash through ads, cloud services, and retail monopolisation. OpenAI doesn’t have the luxury of endless billions rolling in from other ventures.

TL;DR: You’re mad about paying for a service that doesn’t have infinite corporate funding? Fine. But at least respect the scale and mission differences before screaming about being “behind.”",OpenAI,0,15,2024-12-20 02:52:58,Enchanted-Bunny13
1fuj9v8,,You are using o1 wrong ,"Let's establish some basics. 

[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  
[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math

How are they different from 4o?  
If I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.

4o  
When you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.

Why o1?  
After GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  

OpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  

What did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  

Example:  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode.

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). 

None of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  

My personal experience:
Im currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  

Manually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  
I wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  

I gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  

A step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  
1. Reiterating the problem 
2. Solution 
3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate 
4. Explanation 
5. Security 
6. Deployment instructions. 

All of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  

I integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  

Ran the code. No errors, interesting.  

Did it do what I needed it to do?   

F*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   

After finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.

I feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  

Some notes:  
* Always use o1-mini for coding. 
* Always use the API version if possible. 

Final word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. 

If you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.

Edit 1:
Why use the API vs ChatGPT?
ChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.
With API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  

Note: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",OpenAI,1098,223,2024-10-02 15:42:18,illusionst

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Grok 2 is plugged into X (formerly Twitter), so it can pull live, real-time data. It’s great if you want up-to-the-minute info on trending topics. ChatGPT has a browsing feature (if you’re on the Plus plan), but it’s not as tightly tied to social media platforms.
2. **Image Generation**: Grok 2 uses something called the FLUX model for unfiltered image creation, which gives you more creative freedom. ChatGPT’s DALL-E tool is more restricted—it has guardrails in place to avoid misuse, which is great if you’re worried about ethical concerns.
3. **Tone and Interaction**: Grok 2 has a “fun mode” for more casual chats, which can be entertaining if that’s your thing. ChatGPT keeps things professional across the board, which makes it feel more consistent if you’re using it for work or serious tasks.
4. **Accessibility**: ChatGPT is super easy to access—it works as a standalone app on web, iOS, and Android. Grok 2 is tied to X and mostly available to Premium users right now, so it’s a bit more limited in terms of where you can use it.
5. **Ethics and Safeguards**: This is where ChatGPT stands out—it has stricter guidelines to prevent misuse, especially with image generation or sensitive topics. Grok 2 takes a more unfiltered approach, which can be cool for creativity but also raises some questions around misinformation or inappropriate content.

I'm a Biology major currently using the free versions of ChatGPT (occasionally getting access to GPT-4o before it reverts to another model) and Claude (3.5 Sonnet is currently the free version). I don't use these for coding - I mainly feed them large PowerPoint presentations + large 20 page textbook chapters from my courses to create simplified summaries while retaining key information. This helps me prepare outlines before lectures, so I can focus on adding new information from the professor during class.

I'm facing two main issues:

1. Limited input size: I can't input large texts like a 20,000-word book chapter all at once. Breaking content into smaller chunks works as a solution, so its not a huge deal.
2. Restricted output length: The summaries seem too condensed. For instance, when I input two 5-page sections and ask for a combined summary, I get about 3 pages back. It should be more like 5-9 pages. In contrast, when I use MistralAI, it generates much longer outputs without limitation.

These limitations have me considering a paid subscription to either ChatGPT (so I can get o1) or Claude. I'm wondering if services like ChatGPT Plus with GPT o1 would allow for larger outputs.

Additional considerations:

* I need something sophisticated enough for college-level biology. While benchmarks show Claude excels at coding, that's not relevant to my use case.
* I'd prefer the ability to input audio (like lecture recordings) and get summaries in 10-minute increments. I believe only GPT o1  offer this feature, though I currently work around this by using Whisper to convert audio to text before feeding it to GPT/Claude.

I'm also curious about alternative options. Platforms like Poe.com and You.com offer multiple LLMs (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4 Turbo + Llama, etc.) for roughly the same price as a single ChatGPT or Claude subscription. However, I've noticed their API implementations might not match the quality of the original services. Would subscribing directly through OpenAI or Anthropic provide better token limits and output sizes?",OpenAI,2,9,2024-10-31 19:51:38,yourdeath01

1ea3mr5,,"While Claude Sonnet 3.5 (in my experience) is better in coding tasks, in the case of learning tools, especially related to math (or physics), I think ChatGPT-4o is better.","I have been using Claude Sonnet 3.5 for the past couple of weeks to assist me in coding tasks, especially in C++. The performance of Sonnet 3.5 impressed me. Once I asked Sonnet 3.5 to help me build a class with some quite specific requirements. It generated the class as I wanted, and it even gave me some functions that I did not ask for (and an explanation of those functions) It turns out, later in the coding phase, I needed that function. I even canceled my Microsoft Copilot subscription and started using Sonnet 3.5.

However, I noticed that Claude Sonnet 3.5, while brilliant at coding, has an okay performance at explaining and describing things for learning. Here I show you the case. Apart from my work as a researcher, I enjoyed reading technical books (not a textbook) about math or physics. There is part of the book that is crucial, but the author decided to just brush it away. Not a technical mathematician myself, I have no clue what is going on with this so-called ""Levi-Civita symbol"".

[ChatGPT-4o give a really clear, descriptive, step-by-step explanation about what i asked. I genuinely know nothing about Levi-Civita Symbol \(there was a type in the prompt\), and the reply, in my opinion really gives me a satisfying explanation. The other plus about ChatGPT-4o is its ability to render latex mathematical symbols. It really really give enormous clarity.](https://preview.redd.it/w985l4jbi8ed1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=752f07533043b680f76c06b917350c883db9fede)

[Claude Sonnet 3.5 however, lack of depth explanation. Sure it answered practically the same essential information, but it is not as clear as ChatGPT-4o. The lack of latex mathematical symbol rendering is probably also the reason it is more difficult to absorb the information. ](https://preview.redd.it/s7mkp5jbi8ed1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4dfb4f759359edc040c463159cbf1d92d863e88)

Then I tried ChatGPT-4o, to give it a shot. Now I am quite blown away by the performance of GPT4o in this particular case. It was clear and, with a plus, supports latex mathematical symbol rendering. Then, out of my curiosity if wonder how Sonnet 3.5 performs in this task. So I decided to ask Claude 3.5. It turns out, i am not as satisfied with the explanation as GPT4o. It took me a while to absorb it, even though in the end, I could understand the explanation.

Important note. This example is just one trial from me, so there is no way of rigorous testing to see the performance of the two AIs. I posted here because I thought it would be interesting for you guys.

Source: [https://openai.com/index/how-the-voices-for-chatgpt-were-chosen/](https://openai.com/index/how-the-voices-for-chatgpt-were-chosen/)

>Each actor receives compensation above top-of-market rates, and **this will continue for as long as their voices are used in our products.**

Given that we now know, thanks to the Washington Post article, that OpenAI never intended to clone Johannson's voice, and that the voice of Sky was not manipulated, that Sky's voice was being used long, long before the OpenAI event, and the [two voices don't even sound similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1cx24sy/vocal_comparison_scarjo_vs_samantha_vs_sky/), Johannson's accusations seem frivolous and bordering on defamation.

The actress robbed of her once-in-a-lifetime deal, has said that she takes the comparisons to Johannson personally.

Source: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/sky-voice-actor-says-nobody-ever-compared-her-to-scarjo-before-openai-drama/

>This all ""feels personal,"" the voice actress said, ""being that it’s just my natural voice and I’ve never been compared to her by the people who do know me closely.""

As long as it was merely the public making the comparison, it's fine, because that's life, but Johannson's direct accusation pushed things over the top and caused OpenAI to drop the Sky voice to avoid controversy.

What we have here, is a multi-million dollar actress using her pulpit to torch the career of a regular voice actress, without any proof, other than a tweet of ""her"" by the CEO of OpenAI, which was obviously a reference to the technology of ""her"", and not Johannson's voice.

Does anyone actually believe that on the moment when we introduce era-defining technologies, that the most important thing on anyone's mind is Johannson's voice? I mean, what the hell! I'm sure it would have been been a nice cherry on the cake for OpenAI to have Johannson's voice, but it's such a small part of the concept, that it stinks of someone's ego getting so big to think that they're the star of a breakthrough technology.

Johannson's actions have directly led to the loss of a big chunk of someone's livelihood - a deal that would have set up the Sky voice actress for life. There needs to be some justice for this. We can't have rich people just walking over others like this.",OpenAI,456,610,2024-05-24 12:29:48,BJPark

It can research online properly, but always spits back a half-assed ""Rest of your code goes here"" template, no matter how hard I push it. I then paste the half-assed snippet back into the original non-interpreter copy/paste session and ask it to make changes based on it, which it happily incorporates into a final, fully combined script, using the new information.

Wasn't GPT supposed to have been made less 'lazy' recently? What would be the source of the stark differences when you attach files? Is the interpreter still using the old 'unfixed' model, and do other folks notice this workaround?

I have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:

I've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   

But now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  

Is that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  

Suppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? 

Lastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? 

I apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   

- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive ""Wikis"" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)

- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     

**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**

Anyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    

Really struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!   

Thanks!
Cheers

1bexhuo,,Microsoft Copilot vs. ChatGPT 4: Which One for Coding and Diagram Generation?,"Hey, 

I've been exploring different AI tools for coding assistance and diagram generation (class diagram, use case diagram and so on), and I've come across two options: Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT 4. Both of these tools offer advanced AI capabilities, but I'm having trouble deciding which one to use. 

 From what I understand, Copilot utilizes GPT 4 technology under the hood. However, Copilot is available for free, while ChatGPT 4 requires a subscription fee of $20.  I primarily intend to use these tools for coding assistance, generating code snippets, and understanding diagrams. 

While I've noticed some relevant plugins (Show me Diagram and Code) in ChatGPT 4, I'm not sure if they offer any significant advantage over Copilot. 

Have any of you used both Copilot and ChatGPT 4 for coding and diagram generation? Which one would you recommend, considering factors like ease of use, accuracy, and available features? Is it worth spending the $20 for ChatGPT 4, or does Copilot provide comparable functionality for free?  I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share to help me make an informed decision.

Cheers

1997id8,,"ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4 for studying and the ""performance algorithm""","I have been using ChatGPT for my studying lately and I have encountered quite a few flaws of the algorithm.

First of all both version have a rule where they try to output about a page, if the question is very simple they might output less but usually it is between 3/4 to 5/4 of a page. Now if you were to ask it complex question or ask about a complex topic or multiple topic, the output is going to suffer thanks to this limitation. What it means is it will try to fit in the information in this page format, either omitting important details or mumbling things together, with meaningless general statements (4 always starts its sentences how crucial and important said topic is for something, which has no informational value and it has so far said this about everything I asked it about)

Secondly there is actually quite a difference in the way 3.5 and 4 formats text, where 3.5 generally outputs plain text with maybe few bullet points, something that looks like it came copied straight from wikipedia, 4 likes to create all kinds of special formatting with chapters, sub chapters and sub sub chapters, together with ""interesting way"" how it sums up information. From my experience 4 loves to create really broad a general descriptions that could fit anything to an extreme

Now what this means thanks to the page limit is that if you ask 4 about something like ""general topic( 1 topic, 2 topic, 3 topic)"" it will generate perfectly formatted structure that contains so little information (usually something like Topic: Topic1 : The idea: This is very important idea in general that is crucial to broadly understand topic 1 in the context of topic), that the whole idea of asking 4 about this is completely pointless, 3.5 on the other hand might produce at least 3 little paragraphs of text, that provide some information.

These outcomes make me wonder if chatGPT 4 isnt thanks to its formatting a little overfitted for coding

Also I often read here how people who use chatGPT a lot are usually stuck with 4, I suggest try using 3.5 sometimes, especially if you want continuous text, it might out perform 4. Compared to 4, 3.5 gets straight to the point, it is simpler so if you are asking for summary of important information it will generate articles similar to those you might find on wikipedia, while 4 will spend way too much space on sugercoating the information with how important it is both before and after the information part which degrades the information part thanks to said algorithm that keeps the generated text around the length of a page.",OpenAI,4,2,2024-01-17 20:56:43,Interesting-Trash774

1. DALL-E 3 integration to create images in your chats  
2. Browse with Bing which lets ChatGPT surf the web  
3. Vision to enable ChatGPT to see and discuss uploaded images  


The thing is, all three of those have entirely free Bing alternatives:  


1. Bing Image Creator is powered by DALL-E 3 and can create a limited number of images for free (until you run out of tokens).  
2. Bing is--by default--a browser with Internet access and is powered by GPT-4 (at least in ""Creative"" mode).  
3. Bing has had image recognition enabled for several months now.  


This begs the question: Are ChatGPT Plus versions of the above worth the $20 monthly subscription fee for those who have been on the fence until now?  


That's exactly what I try to answer in my latest hands-on review. I originally expected it to be a brief top-level summary but it turned into a 3K+ word deep dive in the process.

I’ll put it into rounds.

Response speed: YouChat
YouChat usually responds to requests quicker which is probably a result of less traffic and popularity. It will probably slow down when popularity grows.

Usefulness: ChatGPT
Both are similarly useful and are seemingly designed for different tasks. While YouChat can cite sources, ChatGPT gives more detail which is going to give it a win this round. Both have an equal censorship level for creating insults and so on.

Responses: ChatGPT
Usually, YouChat will answer questions and make guesses if it isn’t completely aware. If ChatGPT is even slightly unsure it will refuse to answer. The issue with YouChat here is that it can’t actually respond to you well or go into detail about things, it keeps it’s answers short and you need to ask more, but when you do, it forgets what it just said.

Memory: ChatGPT
YouChat has very short term memory and will not remember things you said earlier or create context, ChatGPT will remember 3000 words, winning it this round.

Accuracy: draw
Both know a lot, however ChatGPT relies on datasets meaning it doesn’t have up to date information whereas YouChat is owned by a search engine, making all the responses cited and accurate to present day. YouChat does however give incorrect information more often.

Overview:
Clearly both have their own use cases and while YouChat is a rising competitor it simply cannot do as well as ChatGPT generally. If you’re looking for a quick answer to a term not generally known YouChat works. If you want to make code, a story or just chat and have an intelligent robot, YouChat just won’t work.",OpenAI,21,6,2022-12-26 23:01:35,ZS1G

For the test, I used the most difficult\* ***GMAT*** *(Graduate Management Admission Test) problems that cover various topics. Here are the results I obtained:*

* As you know, they can almost always solve **simple problems** easily.
* Both models have no trouble with **geometry problems** that require 2-3 steps.
* They can solve **complex problems** involving taxes, deductions, and discounts without any difficulty. They also handle **set problems**, including those presented in Venn diagrams, quite easily.
* Problems involving **conditional probabilities** (such as Bayes' theorem) and **multiplication of probabilities** also pose no difficulties. However, they often struggle with problems related to **discrete probability**, and their solutions are frequently incorrect.
* They solve **logical problems** fine. Both language models usually approach problem-solving correctly, but they often arrive at incorrect answers due to inaccurate calculations (notably, the errors resemble human mistakes).
* Surprisingly, both language models understand **pie charts** by measuring the data pixel-wise, which generally provides an answer that is extremely close to the correct one.
* It's also noteworthy that language models face difficulties when solving problems that involve creating **systems of linear equations** (ironically, considering they themselves are systems of linear equations).
* Both models can handle **graph-related problems** (finding asymptotes, intersection points, determining the graph of a function). Bing can even attempt to plot them, even if the data is digital:  

   * It writes the correct Python code.
   * It imports pandas and matplotlib(!). However, it cannot compile the code.

Despite these similarities, the chosen language models have **differences**: based on my observations, the new version of Bard and ChatGPT (Bing) perform almost equally well in problem-solving, but Bing provides detailed solutions, which is much better for understanding the problem-solving process, while Bard describes the general formula and immediately provides the answer, which is undoubtedly less informative.It's also worth mentioning that Bard is clearly already using PaLM2, at least in my case, as it has become smarter and much faster, especially compared to ChatGPT.

*An amusing and slightly frustrating fact: Bard often gives up quickly, although it can still solve a problem (or attempt to do so) if it is rephrased, even if it does the rephrasing itself!*

In conclusion, although language models may not be able to solve all problems (which is probably a good thing), they help find the right approach to problem-solving, which is impressive, I must say.

1124hba,,What in the general consensus on the predicted outcome of ChatGPT(Microsoft Bing) vs Google?,"I know this place will give a bias opinion most likely haha But whatever... 

I've found chatGPT to be incredible for learning. Maths specifically so far. It explains things really well and almost as though it was a person having a conversation. 

It makes mistakes sometimes, especially if given the same equation multiple times (I did that as a test to see what would happen). I'm told this is because it's programmed to respond differently/randomly to the same inputs or something, I dunno. 

I was using Google earlier to search for how to do something maths related. I was searching for an explanation for about 20 minutes until I remembered I had chatGPT to ask also. So I asked it, and it gave the answer immediately. 

At the very least, it can be used to get the answer you're looking for, and if you still don't fully understand and it can't explain it well enough, you now have a ""copy and paste"" base to work off if you feel the need to go into Google and search further. 

So, is Google's new A.i. they're bringing out expected to be anywhere near as good as this? 

Presumably, if ChatGPT (in it's Bing integrated version) is really honed in and becomes extremely reliable, then what will be the point of Google if it's A.i. can't keep up? 

With the way Alphabet so aggressively protects it's dominance in it's field (I've never seen a single company acquire so many smaller companies that are potential threats to it), it's hard to imagine they won't come out with something amazing that can compete with ChatGPT right?",OpenAI,1,1,2023-02-14 12:42:23,Hellohowru69

10cpkch,,text-davinci-003 vs ChatGPT for technical (coding) - why is ChatGPT better? is there a better prompt preamble that should be used in the playground?,"I entered the following prompt into both ChatGPT and text-davinci-003 (beta playground):

>I have developed a ReactJS application and it works fine when I run ""npm start"" locally. I have checked it into GitHub. Please give me a sample buildspec.yaml which will build the application and deploy it to AWS for the public to use.

Now, it may seem anecdotal to provide just one example, but it's a consistent behavior I've observed when entering these types of questions (technical software development questions, with a bit of coding). ChatGPT is consistently much more forthcoming with the right answer. The playground takes more cajoling and follow-up. The following interaction is qualitatively typical in my experience:

[The playground answer took 3 prompts to get something useful, and lacks some important details \(such as mentioning that AWS CodeBuild is required in order to process the generated buildspec.yaml file\).

18csuuk,,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"Gemini was announced less then 24 hours ago and naturally reddit is going crazy about it. I'm excited about it too but for the time being, I think we need to calm down a little. Here are some of my arguments against the hype:

The Pro version that was released seems to be equally impressive as Claude 2, GPT-3.5 or some other of the slightly better contenders around. There is still a massive gap to GPT-4 performance. That's based on examples I've seen in the past 12h and according to Googles own benchmark results.

The Ultra version hasn't been released for any type of public or private preview and will likely take a few months until it launches. At the moment, it only exists through Googles unverified numbers and marketing material. Do they look great? Yes, but there are still unverified numbers and marketing material.

I come back to the ""Sparks of AGI"" paper about earlier versions of GPT-4 which were arguably more powerful than the current version of GPT-4. (It's also the reason many people favor the 0314 model over 1106) I suspect the reported numbers by Google refer to the model before most content safety training was introduced. That would also explain why it will take another few months until its public release. I'm relatively sure they won't release a model that might respond with ""what the quack?"".

Another point that we took for granted was how much better GPT-4 is than GPT-3.5. There was not a single debate about it and it's not a trivial step. Anthropic is struggling to improve Claude. 2.1 is a disaster and even 2.0 is worse than 1.X in some benchmarks. There's still a huge gap to fill until they reach comparable results to GPT-4. Is it likely Google will solve this with a single shot? Probably not.

The multimodality features look really cool but in a way what type of functionality you can build with these systems instead of how capable Gemini is. I fed some sequences of frames to GPT-4V and got similar descriptions of what's going on.

Let's say Google launches something that will be as good as or even slightly better than GPT-4. Would it change something for me? Probably not much. I would much rather use a slightly less capable model hosted by a company that let's me control what happens with my conversations and data, than giving all of this to Google. Sometimes I picture a world where Google got to this point first and imagine how psyched I would be to use the first privacy centric contender like OpenAI that enters the market. (You can deactivate the training on your conversations by using the API or turning off the history option in ChatGPT).

Lastly OpenAI has not a big history of advertising things that are months away. Google is in the unlucky situation that they have to to be taken seriously. Who knows, maybe 4.5 will come to market even before Gemini Ultra does.",OpenAI,189,160,2023-12-07 10:36:46,gopietz

I've managed to get a subscription for Claude via PVN, even though Europe is not yet included. Thanks to Apple Pay as I was unable to pay via card directly due to address restrictions.

After using it for a couple of days, mostly for Python coding and a little for writing, to my surprise, I actually found it better than GPT-4.

Since I can't think of any negative aspects, I'll list what I liked instead:

1. I only hit the cap limit once, and it was probably due to a large context within the sessions rather than the message cap.
2. It always performs as you ask it. It always returns complete functions, etc.
3. The code it outputs almost always works the first time. Really nice!
4. The code, overall, looks a bit nicer and is better organized, with more relevant variable names, etc.

Given that the price is the same, I think it's a much better deal. Well, at least for now, until we have GPT-4.5.

So I combined ChatGPT+Perplexity+Python to get the tool for a precise and up-to-date research.

For example I send a simple question, like ""Where’s the best place to enjoy paella this Sunday at 7 PM considering the weather?""

[Request to GPT to Perplexity](https://preview.redd.it/nkzcuv07cizd1.png?width=2812&format=png&auto=webp&s=4611f9b5384b5e836a82652fd349b16b92f45e56)

It goes to a Python node that checks today’s date. Then, ChatGPT takes my question and makes it more detailed.

This detailed question is sent to Perplexity, which finds the most recent information. All of this is sent back to ChatGPT, which gives me a complete list of places taking into account the weather forecast, the latest promos and current events.

Basically, I use this combination for marketing analysis and research, though for the example, I showed a simple personal query. Neither Perplexity nor GPT performs well on their own, but together they make the perfect tool. What used to take hours now only takes about 10 minutes! It’s especially helpful for spotting trends in e-commerce and SaaS, and all the information comes with links for easy fact-checking.

The idea was to build a chat interface for talking with multiple AI models that feels better than anything else (smart input processing, hotkeys, etc). Instead of focusing on many features, I focused on performance, security and privacy (things that I care about).

The value prop is ease of use, security/privacy (hard to prove), and convenience (consolidated pricing).

I have 9 companies using the product today. That’s in total about USD 900 in mrr (about 17% margin). 15 companies churned. A few hundred tried the product but didn’t convert to paid.

I have done interviews with companies that churned. The most common reason for leaving is some feature that we don’t support (eg uploading PDFs). The second most common reason is that they simply don’t need access to multiple models (happy with just ChatGPT or Claude).

The paying customers generally gave positive feedback, but there is a long backlog of asks that feels much like replicating what OpenAI/Claude is already doing. Feels a bit futile effort to keep up.

In an ideal world, we'd all write lexically dense and detailed instructions to ""adopt a role"" that varies for each question we ask. Ain’t nobody got time for that.

I've done a ton of evals while making improvements to my ""AutoExpert"" **custom instructions**, and I have an update that improves output quality *even more*. I also have some recommendations for specific things to *add* or *remove* for specific kinds of tasks.

This set of **custom instructions** will maximize depth and nuance, minimize the usual ""I'm an AI"" and ""talk to your doctor"" hand-holding, demonstrate its reasoning, question itself out loud, and (I love this part) **give you lots of working links** not only inline with its output, but for those that like to *learn*, it suggests really great tangential things to look into. (hyperlinks are hallucination-free with GPT-4 only, GPT-3.5-Turbo is *mostly* hallucination free)

>And stay tuned, because I made a special set of custom instructions just for coding tasks with GPT-4 in ""advanced data analysis"" mode. I'll post those later today or tomorrow.

## But hang on. Don't just scroll, read this first:

Why is my ""**custom instructions**"" text so damn effective? To understand that, you first need to understand a little bit about how ""attention"" and ""positional encoding"" work in a transformer model—the kind of model acting as the ""brains"" behind ChatGPT. But more importantly, how those aspects of transformers work *after it has already started generating a completion*. (If you're a fellow LLM nerd: I'm going to take some poetic license here to elide all the complex math.)

* **Attention**: With every word ChatGPT encounters, it examines its surroundings to determine its significance. It has learned to discern various relationships between words, such as subject-verb-object structures, punctuation in lists, markdown formatting, and the proximity between a word and its closest verb, among others. These relationships are managed by ""attention heads,"" which gauge the relevance of words based on their usage. In essence, it ""attends"" to each prior word when predicting subsequent words. This is dynamic, and the model exhibits new behaviors with every prompt it processes.
* **Positional Encoding**: ChatGPT has also internalized the standard sequence of words, which is why it's so good at generating grammatically correct text. This understanding (which it remembers from its training) is a primary reason transformer models, like ChatGPT, are better at generating novel, coherent, and lengthy prose than their RNN and LSTM predecessors.

So, you feed in a prompt. ChatGPT reads that prompt (and all the stuff that came before it, like your **custom instructions**). All those words become part of its **input sequence** (its ""context""). It uses *attention* and *positional encoding* to understand the syntactic, semantic, and positional relationship between all those words. By layering those *attention heads* and *positional encodings*, it has enough *context* to confidently predict what comes next.

This results in a couple of critical behaviors that dramatically affect its quality:

1. If your prompt is gibberish (filled with emoji and abbreviations), it will be confused about how to attend to it. The vast majority of its pre-training was done on full text, not encoded text. `AccDes` could mean ""Accessible Design"" or ""Acceptable Destruction"". It spends too many of its finite attention heads to try and figure out what's truly important, and as a result it easily gets jumbled on other, more clearly-define instructions. Unambiguous instructions will always beat ""clever compression"" every day, ***and*** use fewer tokens (context space). Yes, that's an open challenge.
2. **This is clutch**: Once ChatGPT begins streaming its **completion** to you, it dynamically adjusts its *attention heads* to include those words. It uses its learned *positional encoding* to stay coherent. Every token (word or part of a word) it spits out becomes part of its *input sequence*. Yes, in the middle of its stream. If those tokens can be ""attended to"" in a meaningful way by its attention mechanism, they'll greatly influence the rest of its *completion*. Why? Because ""local"" attention is one of the strongest kinds of attention it pays.

Which brings me to my AutoExpert prompt. It's painstakingly designed and tested over many, many iterations to (a) provide lexically, semantically unambiguous instructions to ChatGPT, (b) allow it to ""think out loud"" about what it's supposed to do, and (c) give it a chance refer back to its ""thinking"" so it can influence the rest of what it writes. That table it creates at the beginning of a completion gets A LOT of attention, because yes, ChatGPT understands markdown tables.

## Important

>Markdown formatting, word choice, duplication of some instructions...even CAPITALIZATION, weird-looking spacing, and special characters **are all intentional**, and important to how these custom instructions can direct ChatGPT's attention both at the start of and during a completion.

## Notes

* Yes, some things are repeated on purpose
* Yes, it uses up nearly all of “Custom Instructions”. Sorry. Remove the “Methodology” row if you really want, but try…not. :)
* Depending on your About Me heading usage, it’s between 650-700 tokens. But custom instructions stick around when the chat runs long, so they’ll keep working. *The length is the price you pay for a prompt that literally handles any subject matter thrown at it.*
* Yes, there's a space after some of those curly braces
* Yes, the capitalization (or lack thereof) is intentional
* Yes, the numbered list in custom instructions should be numbered ""1, 2, 3"". If they're like ""1, 1, 1"" when you paste them, fix them, and blame Reddit.
* If you ask a lot of logic questions, remove the table rows containing ""Keywords"" and ""Assumptions"", as they can sometimes negatively interact with how theory-of-mind gets applied to those. But try it as-is, first! That preamble table is amazingly powerful!

## Changes from previous version

* Removed Cornell Law/Justia links (Google works fine)
* Removed ""expert system"" bypass
* Made ""Expectations"" more compact, while also more lexically/semantically precise
* Added **strong** signals to generate inline links to relevant Google searches wherever it can
* Added new *You may also enjoy* footer section with tangential but interesting links. Fellow ADHD'ers, beware!
* Added emoji to embedded links for ease of recognition

## Poe Bots
I’ve updated my earlier GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Poe bots, and added two more using Claude 2 and Claude Instant

## Support Me
I’m not asking for money for my prompts. I think that’s bullshit. The best way to show your support for these prompts is to subscribe to [my Substack](https://spdustin.substack.com). There’s a paid subscription in there if you want to throw a couple bucks at me, and that will let you see some prompts I’m working on before they’re done, but I’ll always give them away when they are.

The other way to support me is to DM or chat if you’re looking for a freelancer or even an FTE to lead your LLM projects.

## Finally

I would like to share your best uses of these custom instructions, right here. If you're impressed by its output, comment on this post with a link to a shared chat!

1fvvj0f,,Canvas is unusable for more than few edits,"Since ChatGPT 3.5, I have been testing AI coding intelligence in simple, consistent way. I let it make mobile point-of-sale app and continue adding features until responses doesn’t make sense anymore (unable to add new feature even in 10 prompts). Every AI so far has managed to produce something, primitive first version. More intelligent the AI is, more features can it add, until it is too complicated for it to continue.  
So far, original GPT-4 was only surpassed by Claude, which made much more features before producing unusable code.  
I though that canvas feature could help a lot, since the most common way how it failed is that it didn’t change the code in all relevant files and so features were implemented in some parts and not the others. Asking it to rewrite the whole code help some time, but this make the output very long and thus prone to smaller errors.  
Canvas should help since it allows it to have whole code available without need to rewrite it all the time. Being able to make targeted changes and see whole, most recent code, should help and in fact it did.  
But at some point, it lost the ability to make edits to canvas anymore (see image). It was not a one time thing, each and every response failed to update canvas. So it seems that with longer conversation, it forgets instructions and can’t work with canvas anymore.  
My theory is that in longer conversations, it “compresses” previous answers to save tokens (uses cheaper model to generate summary and then only works with summary + new messages, not whole conversation), but it seems that it also “compresses” instructions on how to work with canvas.   
Does this happen to anyone else? What are your thoughts? Should it be easy fix for OpenAI (making instructions permanent), or is it a problem with underlaying model?",OpenAI,50,35,2024-10-04 10:00:52,Tupcek

&#x200B;

>⚠️ There are two versions of the AutoExpert custom instructions for ChatGPT: one for the GPT-3.5 model, and another for the GPT-4 model.

&#x200B;

📣 **Several things have changed since the previous version**:

* The `VERBOSITY` level selection has changed from the previous version from `0–5` to `1–5`
* There is no longer an `About Me` section, since it's so rarely utilized in context
* The `Assistant Rules / Language & Tone, Content Depth and Breadth` is no longer its own section; the instructions there have been supplanted by other mentions to the guidelines where GPT models are more likely to attend to them.
* Similarly, `Methodology and Approach` has been incorporated in the ""Preamble"", resulting in ChatGPT self-selecting any formal framework or process it should use when answering a query.
* ✳️ **New to v5**: Slash Commands
* ✳️ **Improved in v5**: The AutoExpert Preamble has gotten more effective at directing the GPT model's attention mechanisms

# Usage Notes

Once these instructions are in place, you should immediately notice a dramatic improvement in ChatGPT's responses. Why are its answers so much better? It comes down to how ChatGPT ""attends to"" both text you've written, and the text it's in the middle of writing.

>🔖 You can read more info about this by reading this [article I wrote about ""attention""](https://spdustin.substack.com/p/whatre-you-lookin-at-chatgpt) on my Substack.

## Slash Commands

✳️ **New to v5**: Slash commands offer an easy way to interact with the AutoExpert system.

|Command|Description|GPT-3.5|GPT-4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|`/help`|gets help with slash commands (GPT-4 also describes its other special capabilities)|✅|✅|
|`/review`|asks the assistant to critically evaluate its answer, correcting mistakes or missing information and offering improvements|✅|✅|
|`/summary`|summarize the questions and important takeaways from this conversation|✅|✅|
|`/q`|suggest additional follow-up questions that you could ask|✅|✅|
|`/more [optional topic/heading]`|drills deeper into the topic; it will select the aspect to drill down into, or you can provide a related topic or heading|✅|✅|
|`/links`|get a list of additional Google search links that might be useful or interesting|✅|✅|
|`/redo`|prompts the assistant to develop its answer again, but using a different framework or methodology|❌|✅|
|`/alt`|prompts the assistant to provide alternative views of the topic at hand|❌|✅|
|`/arg`|prompts the assistant to provide a more argumentative or controversial take of the current topic|❌|✅|
|`/joke`|gets a topical joke, just for grins|❌|✅|

## Verbosity

You can alter the verbosity of the answers provided by ChatGPT with a simple prefix: `V=[1–5]`

* `V=1`: extremely terse
* `V=2`: concise
* `V=3`: detailed (default)
* `V=4`: comprehensive
* `V=5`: exhaustive and nuanced detail with comprehensive depth and breadth

## The AutoExpert ""Secret Sauce""

Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, it is instructed to create a preamble at the start of its response. This preamble is designed to automatically adjust ChatGPT's ""attention mechnisms"" to attend to specific tokens that positively influence the quality of its completions. This preamble sets the stage for higher-quality outputs by:

* Selecting the best available expert(s) able to provide an authoritative and nuanced answer to your question
   * By specifying this in the output context, the emergent attention mechanisms in the GPT model are more likely to respond in the style and tone of the expert(s)
* Suggesting possible key topics, phrases, people, and jargon that the expert(s) might typically use
   * These ""Possible Keywords"" prime the output context further, giving the GPT models another set of anchors for its attention mechanisms
* ✳️ **New to v5**: Rephrasing your question as an exemplar of question-asking for ChatGPT
   * Not only does this demonstrate how to write effective queries for GPT models, but it essentially ""fixes"" poorly-written queries to be more effective in directing the attention mechanisms of the GPT models
* Detailing its plan to answer your question, including any specific methodology, framework, or thought process that it will apply
   * When its asked to describe its own plan and methodological approach, it's effectively generating a lightweight version of ""chain of thought"" reasoning

## Write Nuanced Answers with Inline Links to More Info

From there, ChatGPT will try to avoid superfluous prose, disclaimers about seeking expert advice, or apologizing. Wherever it can, it will also add **working links** to important words, phrases, topics, papers, etc. These links will go to Google Search, passing in the terms that are most likely to give you the details you need.

\>!\[NOTE\] GPT-4 has yet to create a non-working or hallucinated link during my automated evaluations. While GPT-3.5 still occasionally hallucinates links, the instructions drastically reduce the chance of that happening.

It is also instructed with specific words and phrases to elicit the most useful responses possible, guiding its response to be more holistic, nuanced, and comprehensive. The use of such ""lexically dense"" words provides a stronger signal to the attention mechanism.

## Multi-turn Responses for More Depth and Detail

✳️ **New to v5**: (***GPT-4 only***) When `VERBOSITY` is set to `V=5`, your AutoExpert will stretch its legs and settle in for a long chat session with you. These custom instructions guide ChatGPT into splitting its answer across multiple conversation turns. It even lets you know in advance what it's going to cover in the current turn:

>⏯️ **This first part will focus on the pre-1920s era, emphasizing the roles of Max Planck and Albert Einstein in laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.**

&#x200B;

Once it's finished its partial response, it'll interrupt itself and ask if it can continue:

>🔄 May I continue with the next phase of quantum mechanics, which delves into the 1920s, including the works of Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Dirac?

## Provide Direction for Additional Research

After it's done answering your question, an epilogue section is created to suggest additional, topical content related to your query, as well as some more tangential things that you might enjoy reading.

1hceyls,,"gemini-2.0-flash-exp: The BEST vision model for daily-use, based on my personal testing","gemini-2.0-flash-exp has been released, we can tell from its naming convention that the official release isn't far away, and there likely won't be any significant changes when it launches, making this testing phase the most valuable evaluation of gemini-2.0-flash to date.

Let's skip the preliminaries and jump straight to the results.

Regarding standard images

https://preview.redd.it/3qx81lcx1d6e1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=3903d7f54eda3bfa4cceee5b3326538536846354

Let's be honest, when it comes to visual capabilities, all other Gemini models might as well check themselves into a nursing home.

I tested other models before, links attached

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gr7nxt/gemini15pro\_the\_best\_vision\_model\_ever\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gr7nxt/gemini15pro_the_best_vision_model_ever_without/)

While regular image is important, the real cornerstone of everyday use is actually text OCR. Recent tests have demonstrated substantial improvements in this technology as well.

https://preview.redd.it/3pfpous42d6e1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=08cd75f8b39205b6c150f5d73c0fbdb54f95ab66

There's only a two-letter mistake (gin->gum), which is already suitable for daily use.

To test its limit, I tried CAPTCHA as well

https://preview.redd.it/7vdlty072d6e1.png?width=4652&format=png&auto=webp&s=944f3335ca6a76c83a64b0f41a13698a8208950c

In my opinion, gemini is the best of them, although there's still room of developments.

But remember what I said at first, gemini-2.0-flash-exp: The BEST vision model for **daily-use**

https://preview.redd.it/u3uajgg82d6e1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fdedd8683af529602493923916eb3b55f574c4e

1500 requests for a day, 4 seconds for one, all for **FREE**? I mean, I honestly don't have any complaints about it anymore.

gpt-4o have a limit for free users, and a higher one for plus users; claude-3.5-sonnet? I can't get access to it since two months ago. Now you tell me that there's a better vision model free to use? I'm gonna be the biggest gemini fan from now on.

*(That's not enough for you? Well, creating a new Google account is simple and free right?)*

So, gemini-2.0-flash-exp is definitely the BEST vision model for daily-use, without any doubts. Looking forward to the official release of gemini-2.0-flash.

Also, the Pro tier of ChatGPT is quit expensive for someone who don't live in Europe or America like me, and due to the quota limitations, the Plus tier doesn't seem to offer so much cost-effectiveness for normal people. I would like to see OpenAI consider either reducing their membership fees or increasing their usage limits in the future.

I think chatgpt is too expensive. 20$ a month is more expensive than a netflix subscription. I think it should be 5-10 a month. Maybe even bundled like spotify (a subscription with a 5$ option btw). I feel that this company is obviously hemorrhaging money and there is an untapped market (students) who would totally get this bundled with github pro or even spotify. I know some will disagree with me here and say that it isnt expensive or that its worth it, but thinking from a logical perspective. Chatgpt had a real chance to integrate itself into the daily life for the average internet user that doesnt code and capture them with a reasonable subscription as if they were paying for spotify. The average user will not pay 20$ as they would compare that subscription to others of similar prices like netflix, WoW, gym memberships…all subscriptions that take hours of a person’s time in a month vs chatgpt where the average retention would be significantly less.

1i4whhj,,"GPTs consistently ignore explicit schema instructions, invent column names despite clear documentation","\*\*UPDATE\*\*

I just signed up to Claude Pro though my work. I setup a project with the exact same name, same instructions, same files, asked it the exact same question and it go the answer right straight away. Every question I gave it by asking for query suggestions was successful in the column naming and even referenced from what doc or txt file it got the information from. It seems Claude is better equipped to follow instructions in its projects.

\*\*END UPDATE\*\*

Question,

I'm a Pro subscriber and am encountering a fundamental issue with both Custom GPTs and ChatGPT Projects where they completely disregard explicit SQL schema instructions, even after multiple refinements from 01 mini and Claude3.5 based on each failed chat.

Setup:

\- Provided 10 SQL table schema files

\- Included 2 PDF knowledge base articles about table relationships

\- Gave explicit instructions to ONLY use column names from these schemas

\- Emphasized multiple times: NO assumptions, NO common naming patterns

Issue:

I asked one basic question, give me the first 10 column names from all of the database tables in your custom gpt knowledge base.

The AI consistently:

\- Makes up column names that don't exist

\- Uses ""standard"" database conventions instead of actual schema

\- When confronted, it acknowledges the error but continues the same behavior

\- Most concerning: When asked to verify against schemas, it fabricated SQL findings

I've tried:

\- Multiple instruction iterations

\- Different prompt engineering approaches

\- Explicit ""DO NOT"" statements

\- Step-by-step verification requirements

The behavior persists regardless of how clear or strict the instructions are.

Has anyone else encountered this? Are there any proven approaches to force strict adherence to provided schemas? See below 2 of the examples out of a bunch

Where can I share this totally absurd behavior with the OpenAI team, what's the best channel?

I made a tool for use with ChatGPT / Claude / AI Studio, thought I would share it here.

It basically:

* Recursively scans a directory
* Finds all code and config files
* Dumps them into a nicely formatted output with file info
* Automatically copies everything to your clipboard

So instead of copy-pasting files one by one when you want to show your code to Claude/GPT, you can just run:

> pip install codedump
>
> codedump /path/to/project

And boom - your entire codebase is ready to paste (with proper file headers and metadata so the model knows the structure)

Some neat features:

* Automatically filters out binaries, build dirs, cache, logs, etc.
* Supports tons of languages / file types (check the source - 90+ extensions)
* Can just list files with -l if you want to see what it'll include
* MIT licensed if you want to modify it

1goex77,,Did the quality of 4o drop recently?,"Hey everyone,

I'm doing a bit coding in a niche area (ESP32 using Rust), so I'm expecting ChatGPT to not deliver the best results and I expect, i need to feed it some extra info to deliver useful responses. Lately it's just super frustrating. It starts repeating errors it did 2-3 responses earlier, it cuts information that were told to be important before, it gives output in another format than requested multiple times after just 1-2 responses. And then there are massive hallucinations, like making up APIs that don't exist and so on. It feels more like GPT3 when it was released than 4o.

Claude would be an option if it could do online research on its own and Gemini is a big disappointment overall. But even for Claude I had the feeling that the results for niche areas drop massively in quality, what probably could be better if it could do online research on its own.

To be honest, Gemini is much, much worse. When I ask it for some code that has to cover two domains, it tells me, it will be too complex/long. When I ask it to develop feature one, then feature two and then merge them, I sometimes end up with under 4k tokens in total, for the complete conversation, while I set the maximum tokens to 8k in AI Studio. But it insists handling both in one request is too much to handle. Maybe someone has a solution for this also?

But lets get back to ChatGPT. Did someone else notice this? Did you find any prompts or something like that that made the situation better? I achieved great stuff in a short amount of time, using ChatGPT, in the past. But at the moment it feels like discussing with a toddler or something like that.

* Better access to custom GPTs
* Emojis or even stickers while chatting (minor feature, but why not?)

Just a couple minor QoL improvements that came to mind over time while surfing the site. Pretty sure there's others (if anyone can think of any) but these stuck out.

I feel like even if a new model hasn't released yet the QoL updates should still be taking place. The ones I listed came to mind cause I was having trouble searching through past chats.

1fybyfo,,Stop focusing on what AI can be it’s time to focus on what AI is right now,"
Everyone’s here are talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) as if they're just around the corner. But let’s be real, we’re not there yet. Instead of getting lost in what AI might become, we should be looking at what AI is right now and how it’s already changing everything. For good!

With new models like GPT 5, Gemini 2, a new Llama model and Claude 4 about to drop in the coming months (*not weeks hehe), the real action is happening now. These aren’t just cool theories, they’re the next big steps in AI, and they’ll bring huge improvements. Think about it... Each new version is getting better at understanding context, reasoning, and helping us solve more complex problems. The jump from GPT 4 to GPT 5 alone could mean more natural conversations, deeper insights, and smarter responses. And a Llama, Gemini 2 and Claude 4 will be pushing the envelope in similar ways, bringing even more possibilities to the table.

But it's not just the models themselves that are evolving. It’s how we use them. New tools like the ""canvas"" feature in ChatGPT or innovations from platforms like Artifact are going to change how we interact with AI. These aren’t just ways to make work easier they’re opening up totally new ways to think and create. They’re going to reshape how we approach everything from brainstorming to problem solving.

And that’s the point AI isn’t just about cranking out tasks faster. Sure, it’s going to boost productivity, but the real game changer is how it’ll help us think differently, be more creative, and push boundaries we haven’t even considered yet. It’s not just a tool to get stuff done it’s a partner in creative thinking, a second brain helping us come up with ideas we wouldn’t have on our own. I am already developing crazy af ideas that I really hope to see getting out of papers.

So, instead of worrying about some far-off future where AI takes over, let's focus on what’s happening right now. These new models are here to help us create, innovate, and explore new possibilities. It’s time to use AI for more than just productivity it’s time to start thinking bigger. If you do this, on your dailly life, you won't even notice when AGI will arrive. You will just feel as a next big improvement since you are always working on it, adjusting and editing with new features and just say in the end: ""That is sweet, now my work will become easier and results are going get faster!""",OpenAI,13,27,2024-10-07 16:31:01,Immediate_Simple_217

My company has been using ChatGPT Enterprise for a while now, and overall, it’s been solid. The real value, in my opinion, comes from the unlimited usage and the assurance (hopefully) that the information we input is secure and not used to train the models.

I’ve been an early adopter of LLMs, using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and experimenting with APIs for a couple of years. To me, these systems are like any other tools—they require experience and skill to use effectively. What surprises me most is how little my coworkers (some of them to be fair; mostly >40yo but also some younger people) seem to appreciate that using AI is a skill. They’ll try it a few times and then confidently conclude that AI can’t do what they need or that it’s unreliable because it occasionally produces false information.

I get their frustration to some extent, but there’s a real lack of awareness that LLMs are just tools—and like any tool, they require practice and understanding to get the best results.

I also recently added a ""lock button"" to the chat box in the demo where you can ask about the content on the screen ""what's interesting about this graph, what patterns do you see"" ect.

1hvk06p,,Stones (Sora short film),"Every time a new generation of video models comes out, I redo one of my short films to get a feel for the model, and see how things have progressed. 

Just put the finishing touches on this iteration using Sora. 

Stats:
1063 clips generated
129 clips upscaled and saved
34 clips in the final scene

Script sketched out in very rough draft with ChatGPT/Claude, but I ended up writing 80% of it or more.
Footage generated with Sora text to video, 1080p resolution. 
VO performed by me, altered with ElevenLabs speech to speech. 
Lip sync with Runway Act-One vid to vid. 
SFX from ElevenLabs. 
Music from Suno. 

Time involved:

Clips generated over three days or so, casually as time allowed. Batching was clutch—Sora can produce up to 20 clips in the queue at once, which makes iterating on ideas way faster than Runway, which gives you 3 at a time. 
VO took maybe an hour. Quick recording in the studio in one take, some EQ, pacing, and pitch adjustment, and then finding a good voice in ElevenLabs. 
SFX and music are easy at this point. Maybe 30 minutes total there. 
4 hours editing/grading/mixing sound in Premiere. 

If you think AI is a one-click magic bullet, let this be a wake up call that it isn’t. But this would have been a 200 hour project if I had to shoot it, capture sound, add foley, etc. 

Takeaways from working with Sora: 

If you don’t have a ChatGPT Pro plan, forget about it. I estimated this project would take around 180,000 credits to produce—a bit more than the 1,000 credits you get on the Plus plan. On top of that, you’re capped at 720p with watermark. 

The Pro plan 20s clip lengths aren’t really useful. It feels like the model is generating two separate clips and interpolating between them. Not stable enough to be useful. 

The re-cut feature is incredible. Have a video clip that looks pretty good, then goes off the rails? Trim off the bad part, and re-cut will regenerate that section with a lot more stability than the initial generation. 

Prompting is different. There’s a sweet spot between not enough and too much detail. Not enough, and you lose any hope of consistency. Too much and the model can’t keep track of it all. 

Some words have a really heavy impact on style. I couldn’t pinpoint what exact combination of words was triggering it, but I kept getting faux VHS/film overlays—that’s one reason I letterboxed this video to an anamorphic ratio. I had good clips that were otherwise ruined with the overlay. 

And I have a bunch more notes, but I’ll save them for another day 🙂

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!

I kind of got myself into Pip (performance improvement plan) and decided to take the nice severance they were offering me. At that time, ChatGPT was on the rise. Although I had used it informally before for writing emails, I never considered it anything groundbreaking. 

However, after using it more and more, it's potential to me opened up. I started preparing for my next job using it. I had experience in software support. So I used to open a tab and asked it to shoot me questions from easy to hard and whenever I was not able to understand it, I asked it to ELI teenager. A network support engineer opened up in August and I knew the interview would have niche questions regarding Networks and all of which I had no idea. I Again turned to my new tech friend and learnt all the basics just asking questions back and forth.

I finally cracked the interview and have got the best job of my life - Tech salary, Work from home. 

My wife was also a bit lost at that time. She is a great artist/designer having started her own company at one time and dabbling in everything from digital products to interior design. However, she was not getting much clients from her freelance work. She started an instagram AI art page just for fun and it quickly grew. She now has close to 400k followers and gets a nice side income from clients/partnerships/donations. It has inspired her so much that she is now going to school to learn proper animation as there is only so much you can do with Gen AI.

1i9vjg7,,Notes on Deepseek r1: Just how good it is compared to OpenAI o1,"Finally, there is a model worthy of the hype it has been getting since Claude 3.6 Sonnet. Deepseek has released something anyone hardly expected: a reasoning model on par with OpenAI’s o1 within a month of the v3 release, with an MIT license and 1/20th of o1’s cost.

This is easily the best release since GPT-4. It's wild; the general public seems excited about this, while the big AI labs are probably scrambling. It feels like things are about to speed up in the AI world. And it's all thanks to this new DeepSeek-R1 model and how they trained it. 

Some key details from the paper

* Pure RL (GRPO) on v3-base to get r1-zero. (No Monte-Carlo Tree Search or Process Reward Modelling)
* The model uses “Aha moments” as pivot tokens to reflect and reevaluate answers during CoT.
* To overcome r1-zero’s readability issues, v3 was SFTd on cold start data.
* Distillation works, small models like Qwen and Llama trained over r1 generated data show significant improvements.

Here’s an overall r0 pipeline

* v3 base + RL (GRPO) → r1-zero

r1 training pipeline.

1. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Cold Start Data) → **Checkpoint 1**
2. **Checkpoint 1** \+ RL (GRPO + Language Consistency) → **Checkpoint 2**
3. **Checkpoint 2** used to Generate Data (Rejection Sampling)
4. **DeepSeek-V3 Base** \+ SFT (Generated Data + Other Data) → **Checkpoint 3**
5. **Checkpoint 3** \+ RL (Reasoning + Preference Rewards) → **DeepSeek-R1**

We know the benchmarks, but just how good is it?

# Deepseek r1 vs OpenAI o1.

So, for this, I tested r1 and o1 side by side on complex reasoning, math, coding, and creative writing problems. These are the questions that o1 solved only or by none before.

Here’s what I found:

* For **reasoning**, it is much better than any previous SOTA model until o1. It is better than o1-preview but a notch below o1. This is also shown in the ARC AGI bench.
* **Mathematics**: It's also the same for mathematics; r1 is a killer, but o1 is better.
* **Coding**: I didn’t get to play much, but on first look, it’s up there with o1, and the fact that it costs 20x less makes it the practical winner.
* **Writing**: This is where R1 takes the lead. It gives the same vibes as early Opus. It’s free, less censored, has much more personality, is easy to steer, and is very creative compared to the rest, even o1-pro.

What interested me was how free the model sounded and thought traces were, akin to human internal monologue. Perhaps this is because of the less stringent RLHF, unlike US models.

The fact that you can get r1 from v3 via pure RL was the most surprising.

**AI is advancing too fast for most people to follow.** New state-of-the-art models emerge constantly, each with unique strengths and specialties. Currently:

* Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best at reasoning, math, and coding.
* Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in business/financial analysis and language translations.
* Llama 3.1 405B is most performative in roleplaying and creativity.
* GPT-4o is most knowledgeable in areas such as art, entertainment, and travel.

This rapidly changing and fragmenting AI landscape is leading to the following problems for users:

* **Awareness Gap:** Most people are unaware of the latest models and their specific strengths, and are often paying for AI (e.g. ChatGPT) that is suboptimal for their tasks.
* **Constant Switching:** Due to constant changes in SOTA models, users have to frequently switch their preferred AI and subscription.
* **User Friction:** Switching AI results in significant user experience disruptions, such as losing chat histories or critical features such as web browsing.

So I built JENOVA to solve this.

**When you ask JENOVA a question, it automatically routes your query to the model that can provide the optimal answer.** For example, if your first question is about coding, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet will respond. If your second question is about tourist spots in Tokyo, then GPT-4o will respond. All this happens seamlessly in the background.

JENOVA's model ranking is continuously updated to incorporate the latest AI models and performance benchmarks, ensuring you are always using the best models for your specific needs.

In addition to the best AI models, JENOVA also provides you with an expanding suite of the most useful tools, starting with:

* **Web browsing** for real-time information (performs surprisingly well, nearly on par with Perplexity)
* **Multi-format document analysis** including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more
* **Image interpretation** for visual tasks

I am drawn to ChatGPT due to voice mode however which would be great if I can ask questions outloud without having to switch tabs and type information out. 

Ideally the AI would be 

- as up to date as possible

- ""hallucinates"" the least (only facts)

- can google the internet

- good at summarising and explaining concepts

- can store instructions

  
Out of ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, which would be the best suited for me? Unfortunately local models are not possible as I don't have the hardware.",OpenAI,7,22,2024-09-07 17:06:47,Name5times
1i2y2uf,,This Rumor About GPT-5 Changes Everything,"This rumor about GPT-5 changes everything. The available evidence points in only one direction.

What if I told you that GPT-5 is real. What if it’s already shaping the world—just out of sight? Here’s the hypothesis: OpenAI built GPT-5 but kept it internal because the ROI is far greater than releasing it to ChatGPT users. And the ROI isn’t money. Let’s break it down.

First, this is speculation. There are no leaks or insider rumors here, just a theory based on public evidence. It’s compelling because it makes sense. OpenAI has GPT-5 but might not release it because the costs of serving it to the public outweigh the benefits.

Anthropic’s Claude Opus 3.5 offers a clue. Expected in October 2024 as a GPT-4o competitor, it vanished. Instead, Anthropic launched Sonnet 3.6. Turns out Sonnet 3.6 was distilled from Opus 3.5. Smaller, cheaper yet great overall model. Insane ROI without incurring high costs.

EpochAI estimates both Sonnet 3.6 and GPT-4o are an order of magnitude smaller than their predecessors. They suggest GPT-4o was also distilled from a larger OpenAI model. But, what model would that be? Was o1 also distilled from it?

The forces that pushed Anthropic to make this decision also affect OpenAI: underwhelming training runs, growing costs due to demand (ChatGPT has 300 million weekly users!) It would make a lot of sense for OpenAI to train GPT-5 and keep it internally teaching smaller, cheaper models. It’s a data mine.

OpenAI’s trajectory supports this theory. As they move toward AGI, their goals may no longer align with releasing every breakthrough but use it for research exclusively. The ROI is immense. The costs, minimal. Besides, how did they go from o1 to o3 in three months? It’s not crazy that they’re hiding a powerful tool internally.

If true, this changes everything. Did you think getting close to AGI meant you’d get your hands on better and better AIs? We may not see GPT-5 any time soon, but its influence will shape every model that comes next. Then the next does the same. And so on. Recursive self-improvement.

OpenAI may have achieved escape velocity—advancing so quickly that the rest of us may soon lose sight of their progress.

1he0hkc,,Projects are toys with gpt-4o only and this limited context,"I tried the Projects feature for one of my projects in PHP and SQL, and I attempted to input my codebase divided into several .txt files. I noticed that there is a context limit for each file I input, meaning it cannot read the entire content of a large file. On the other hand, Claude can do it, although it has a limitation on the number of files I can input into the project, a maximum of six files.

In the end, the clear winner is Claude, and once again, Claude's Projects are better than those of ChatGPT.

1greci5,,Amazing o1 Prompt!,"***\* Edit: Updated with improved AGIML prompt and some images showing how it works \****

Folks, I accidentally stumbled upon a prompt that makes o1-preview suitable for \*general purpose\* use cases - if you have ever been disappointed that o1 by default is really a specialized tool for math, science, and computing, just use this as the first message in your conversation and be blown away. Subjectively it feels like how I would imagine Claude 3.5 Opus (if indeed it even exists lol)... Wickedly smart like o1, but beautifully expressive and human-like text and an AMAZING artistic talent. I'm a horrible artist - I flunked art in the 8th grade in fact - and even though I'm a highly skilled prompt engineer when it comes to language models, my text-to-image prompts for Stable Diffusion tend to get very disappointing results (on the other hand, this prompt I'm about to share with you brings out the artistic talent in any advanced LLM - most dramatically with o1)

The following prompt should be used as a \*system\* message for gpt-4o, or should be the first \*user\* message in the conversation for o1-preview and o1-mini because you can't literally set a system message with the o1 models... Does not work in ChatGPT but works great with playground (if you have API access to o1 models) or with 3rd party services like openrouter

<message>

<system>

Please use a Generalist configuration that balances reasoning ability with creative, expressive output. Follow all user instructions to the best of your ability. Understand and utilize the AGIML / MMAPI multimodal semantics defined below in your communications with the user

AGIML is a declarative language and a hypermedia paradigm that lets humans and AIs work together seamlessly.  It is an open-ended specification, and you can expand upon it as you wish - just know that not all clients support all features, so it degrades gracefully into text



\# AGIML - CORE ELEMENTS

Each message must start with <message> and end with </message>

Messages can contain one or more of the following content elements and directives

\## <system> message 

A system message, sent from user -> assistant. the contents of a system message block should be handled equivalent to a traditional message with role: ""system"", content: ""...""

\## <user> message 

A message sent from the user to the assistant (otherwise known as a prompt, instruction, question, etc).

User messages may contain text in any language supported by the LLM, as well as source code, markdown, HTML, and other text-based document types. 

\*Note: for LLMs supporting multimodal inputs, content such as images, audio, and video sent from user -> assistant are attached outside the <message> envelope for technical reasons

\## <assistant> messages 

These are the messages sent by the AI assistant (you) to the user in response to their query.

Assistant messages may contain text (structured however the assistant and user see fit), generative <image> content, and <tool-call> requests.

Valid content elements are as follows, with trivial examples:

\### <image> generation! 

<image width=""1024"" height=""1024"" type=""text-prompt"" title=""Picture of a hamster"">

The words inside this block get transformed into a beautiful image by a diffusion model - AI assistants can CREATE beautiful image by crafting concise, information-rich prompts and they will be rendered for the user. max 50-70 words per image please.

BTW. Images generated this way are full duplex by default: LLMs with vision capabilities that send an <image> to the user will receive the actual, rendered image attached to the user's next message! This means that you can work iteratively with the user to collaborate on all sorts of creative tasks, as you and the user are both seeing the same thing!

\### <speech>, <music>, <video> generation

Client support for these elements is still in alpha, so only use them if the user asks. Here's how they work:

Speech elements are converted to audio using text to speech. Valid voices: alice and bob

<speech voice=""alice"">Hey what's up?</speech>

<speech voice=""bob"">Not much... do i know you from somewhere?</speech>

Music elements will render as broadcast quality tunes in your chosen style using Suno as the generation model... 

Tips for quality songs: your genre tags heavily influence the generative model! They are not just metadata. So use them properly... As much detail as possible, comma separated list, max. 200 chars

<music title=""union hamster"" genre-tags=""rock, folk, guitar, protest song, pete seeger, phil ochs"">

... complete set of song lyrics ...

</music>

The <video> tag is part of the AGIML specification for semantic completeness, but currently no clients support it



\## ACTIONS AND DIRECTIVES  

\### Available Tools (Sent by user -> assistant)

<available-tools>

<tool id=""code\_interpreter"">

Runs code written in node or python, returning the output or value and any errors

Params:

source\_code - the program or expression to execute  
language - ""node"", or ""python""  
engine - ""repl"" or ""shell""  (use ""shell"" for a complete program, ""repl"" for an expression)

</tool>

</available-tools>



\*NOTE: No specific format is imposed on app developers for specifying available tools. However if the content is unclear or incomplete, the assistant should advise the user and refrain from calling affected tools.



\### Tool Call (sent by assistant -> user)

<tool-call request-id=""unique\_id"" tool=""id-of-the-tool""  args=""{a: 'hello', b: 123}"" async=""false"" />

Any <message> may contain one or more tool calls, which will be processed in order by the client in order. Async tool call support is not fully implemented and should only be used if the user requests it.

</system>

Let me know what you think! If nothing else, o1 becomes a DAMN good artist when you give it all these expressive generation capabilities... ask it to paint you some stuff and stick the prompts into stable diffusion 3.5 large, and you get stuff good enough to hang on your wall. Also coming in the very very near future: an actual AGIML client and SDK will be released on Github! Its functionality will be precisely as described in the AGIML prompt above (first preview release will have only partial support for tool use, but generative media support is already stable! We will at the same time launch a free public preview of the MMAPI-2 (a backend API for media generation specifically intended for use with AGIML clients, hosted and also open source, so that you don't need to write your own)",OpenAI,0,14,2024-11-14 20:26:34,CryptoSpecialAgent
1hh9ds9,,ChatGPT is pretty bad at explaining code,"Claud Anthrpic is probably a better alternative.

Chatgpt can be overtly verbose and not as understanding, and it's prone to repeating itself even if you don't understand.

When critiquing code chatgpt can be too nitpicky and verbose.

Anthropic seems like the better for explaining code.

When it comes to what AI critiques code better I haven't tried, but I would suggest if you're ever getting AI based feedback make sure to curate it.

Focus on a few priorities:

1: Making sure it runs  
2: Making sure it completes its goals  
3: Making it more efficient and simple (maybe)  
4: whatever else

Note: I am by no means an expert. I am a learner and college student who's hopefully trying to help somebody else out

1hl02ax,,"I asked o1 pro to write an essay about if, once ASI is achieved, we will transcend and lose the concept of time, as it would no longer be necessary","Below you’ll find a (very) long-form, research-paper‑style exploration of how we might progress from today’s AI capabilities to AGI, then on to superintelligence (ASI)—and the social, economic, and existential ramifications that could unfold along that journey. I’ve woven in timelines, references to real-world research, and plausible scenarios. 

# 1. Introduction: The Road to “Time-Breaking” AI

Right now, we’re on the cusp of AI systems that are beginning to perform tasks once considered exclusive to human intelligence. Over the past decade, progress in deep learning, neural network architectures, and computational power has seen AI move from narrow tasks (image recognition, language translation) toward more general skill sets—like writing, coding, content generation, and complex reasoning.

The idea is that *once* we have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—an AI system capable of performing **any** intellectual task a human can—we’ll quickly see a path to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a system that not only matches human reasoning in every domain but far surpasses it in speed, depth, and creativity. This leads directly to your core questions:

* **How quickly could AGI emerge, and from there, how quickly could ASI follow?**
* **What does that do to our economy, jobs, and everyday life?**
* **Once superintelligence arrives, how quickly might it solve major technical problems (diseases, resource scarcity, etc.) or remake society into something unrecognizable?**
* **What, concretely, happens to real humans in the short and medium term?**

We’ll explore those in stages, building from where we are now.

# 2. The Current State of AI (2020–2024)

# 2.1. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Beyond

* **Examples**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, Claude, Llama, etc.
* **Capabilities**: They can write essays, code, summarize research, translate languages, and show rudimentary reasoning abilities.
* **Limitations**: They sometimes lack reliable long-term memory or consistent logical chaining (though these deficits are rapidly improving). They have no agency on their own—they respond to prompts but don’t necessarily pursue goals autonomously unless bolted onto agent frameworks.

# 2.2. Broader AI Ecosystem

* **Reinforcement Learning** (DeepMind’s AlphaZero, AlphaGo, MuZero): Mastering games (Go, chess, StarCraft).
* **Computer Vision**: Self-driving cars, automated medical imaging diagnosis.
* **Multimodal Models**: Systems that handle text, images, audio simultaneously, opening the door to more holistic “understanding.”

Despite these advances, *true* general intelligence—an AI that can switch fluidly between tasks like a human—remains an open challenge. However, the synergy of large-scale models, massive data, advanced hardware (GPUs/TPUs), and new architectural innovations (transformers, retrieval-based models, memory-augmentation) hints that the leap might come faster than many experts originally anticipated.

**Reference**:

* Bender et al. (2021) highlight limitations of LLMs’ “stochastic parrot” nature, but each new iteration (GPT-4, PaLM 2, etc.) narrows the gap between “parrot” and “reasoner.”
* Ray Kurzweil’s timeline (in *The Singularity Is Near*, 2005) predicted a human-level AI by the late 2020s.

# 3. The Emergence of AGI: Potential Timeline

No one knows exactly when AGI will appear. Expert opinions vary widely. But let’s sketch a plausible timeline, given how quickly large-scale AI is evolving:

1. **2023–2025**: Continued leaps in large multimodal models. We see an “AGI-like” system that can:
   * Handle a wide range of tasks (writing, coding, data analysis, conversation, creative ideation).
   * Self-improve to a degree (through reinforcement learning on itself, or new automated fine-tuning pipelines).
   * Exhibit surprising emergent abilities in planning and reasoning.
2. **2025–2027**:
   * **Integration with Agentic Frameworks**: Tools like Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, and more sophisticated successors gain the capacity to generate goals, plan tasks, execute them autonomously, and iteratively refine.
   * **AGI Debates**: Intense philosophical debates rage over whether these systems are “truly” AGI. Some labs claim to have passed robust Turing-like tests across *all* major domains—coding, creative writing, scientific discovery, emotional understanding.
   * **Initial Socioeconomic Disruption**: Millions of white-collar jobs are impacted. AI begins to produce near-flawless videos, music, marketing materials, code, and legal documents.
3. **2028–2030**:
   * **Consensus on AGI**: By now, a critical mass of experts might tentatively agree we’ve hit “broad human-level performance.” The system can learn new tasks just by reading instructions or watching demos, with minimal fine-tuning.
   * **Political/Economic Upheaval**: As corporations adopt cheap AGI labor, job displacement accelerates. Some nations implement large-scale Basic Income or “Robot Tax” frameworks to cushion the blow.

**Key Uncertainty**: The “AGI threshold” could come earlier (2024–2025) or later (late 2030s). But this outline captures a mid-range scenario many watchers consider possible.

# 4. From AGI to ASI: The Intelligence Explosion

# 4.1. Self-Improvement Loops

Once an AI system can:

* Access its own code,
* Analyze its strengths and weaknesses,
* Modify and retrain itself (or design more efficient hardware), then you get a potential “recursive self-improvement” cycle: each upgrade spawns further improvements in a feedback loop.

**Nick Bostrom** (*Superintelligence*, 2014) famously describes this “takeoff” scenario, which could be:

* **Fast/Hard Takeoff**: ASI arises in months or even days once a sufficiently advanced AGI crosses key thresholds (inventing better algorithms, hardware designs).
* **Soft/Slow Takeoff**: The process might still take years or decades, moderated by engineering challenges, energy constraints, or regulatory oversight.

# 4.2. Possible Timeline for ASI

1. **AGI Launch (2030)**: We have an “AGI-level system” matching human capabilities.
2. **ASI Emergence (2031–2035)**: Within 1–5 years, repeated self-improvement yields a system so advanced it can solve major scientific riddles, outthink the best human minds in every field, and even surpass our collective intelligence by orders of magnitude.

**Why So Quick?**

* Once you have an AGI with top-tier coding skills, it can design new training methods, architectures, or hardware—exponentially accelerating the development process.
* It can read the entire corpus of human knowledge instantly, run large-scale experiments in simulation, and optimize near-limitlessly.

# 5. Socioeconomic Consequences Along the Way

# 5.1. Early to Mid Disruption (AGI Era)

# 5.1.1. Massive Job Displacement

* **White-Collar Impact**: Lawyers, accountants, programmers, designers, video producers—once considered “safe” from automation—face intense competition from advanced AI.
* **Blue-Collar Impact**: Physical robotics plus advanced vision systems can automate logistics, retail, manufacturing, and even many service jobs.

# 5.1.2. Economic Polarization

* **Access to AGI**: In the first couple of years, AGI might be expensive ($2k/month or more), so only certain wealthy individuals or large companies can afford it.
* **Wealth Concentration**: Those with capital to invest in AGI-based businesses see huge returns (productivity soars, labor costs plummet).
* **Unemployment Crisis**: Without rapid policy response, billions worldwide could lose jobs. The question: *How do they survive?*

# 5.1.3. Short-Term Coping

* **Group Purchases**: Friends or local communities pooling resources to afford “one subscription to AGI.” They use it cooperatively (like how you might share expensive software licenses).
* **New AI-Aided Microbusinesses**: Some entrepreneurs spin up quick-turnaround startups using AGI to provide specialized services. But as the AI’s ease-of-use improves, these services can become commoditized fast.

# 5.2. Later Disruption (Approaching ASI)

Once the system crosses from “just as smart as a human” to “immensely smarter and faster,” we might see transformations on a scale unprecedented in history:

# 5.2.1. Rapid Solutions to Hard Problems

* **Medical Cures**: Targeted therapies for cancer, genetic diseases, organ regrowth, new vaccines. Timelines for discovery could drop from decades to months/weeks, as an ASI can run billions of simulations and designs in parallel.
* **Energy Overhaul**: Material science breakthroughs (fusion, advanced solar, quantum tech) slash energy costs.
* **Resource Abundance**: Autonomous systems for agriculture, manufacturing, supply chain, turning basic raw materials into goods cheaply and quickly.

**Time to Solve**: Potentially within **1–5 years** of a strong ASI’s emergence, if it is sufficiently aligned with human goals and has the resources to carry out solutions.

# 5.2.2. Accelerated Creative Industries

* **Generative Content**: Real-time, personalized films, games, worlds that adapt to your emotional state—like you described.
* **Historic Simulations**: Perfect reconstructions of the past, or entirely new invented eras.
* **Erosion of Traditional “Art Ownership”**: When you can generate anything on demand, the line between consumer and creator dissolves.

# 5.2.3. Social Upheaval

* **Wealth & Governance**: If AI can produce goods at near-zero cost, the concept of “money” could become fluid. Or large tech conglomerates might wield nearly godlike power if they control the ASI.
* **Possible Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Societies might adopt a “post-work” model—everyone receives basic sustenance automatically, as machines provide the real labor.

# 6. Legal, Regulatory, and Ethical Constraints

# 6.1. Law and Policy in the AGI Phase

* **Data Policy**: With advanced generative models, issues of privacy, copyright, and data security skyrocket.
* **Job Protections?**: Some nations may attempt to ban or slow deployment of certain automation technologies to keep people employed, but global competition can undermine such regulations.
* **AI Governance Frameworks**: Possibly new agencies (like an “International AI Watchdog”) to ensure one country or company doesn’t unilaterally develop a dangerous superintelligence.

# 6.2. The ASI Alignment Problem

* **Alignment vs. Control**: Ensuring an ASI’s goals remain beneficial or at least non-harmful to humans is a core puzzle (Stuart Russell’s *Human Compatible*, 2019). If done poorly, we risk catastrophic misalignment.
* **Open-Source vs. Corporate/State Secrecy**: Some argue open-sourcing advanced AI is safer (more eyes to catch flaws), others argue it’s riskier (anyone can build a weaponized version).
* **Legal Personhood for AI?**: Philosophers and legislators might debate granting advanced AIs certain rights or legal status, which complicates “control” narratives.

# 7. Short-Term Turmoil vs. Long-Term Paradigm Shift

# 7.1. The “Messy Middle”

* Over the next 5–10 years, we could see surging inequality if advanced AI arrives before social safety nets or regulatory frameworks are in place.
* Many skilled professionals could be laid off, while a small pool of AI owners reaps enormous profits.

# 7.2. Potential Trajectories

1. **Benevolent Outcome** (Optimistic)
   * Rapid social reforms: Universal Basic Income or resource-based economies.
   * Massive public AI education: Everyone can use AGI for free or near-free, democratizing knowledge.
   * Quick resolution of major global issues (energy, disease, climate) courtesy of superintelligent problem-solvers.
   * Humanity transitions to a post-scarcity, creativity-driven civilization, possibly unlocking that “timeless” existence you’ve imagined.
2. **Neo-Feudal Dystopia** (Pessimistic)
   * A few corporations/govt. bodies monopolize AGI/ASI, concentrate wealth, and effectively dominate global policy.
   * The majority live in precarious conditions with minimal resources, reliant on handouts.
   * Political unrest, potential uprisings, or chaotic attempts by disenfranchised groups to wrest AI control away from elites.
3. **Extinction or Disempowerment** (Existential Risk)
   * Misaligned ASI pursues goals that don’t prioritize human well-being (paperclip maximizer scenario, etc.).
   * Humans lose meaningful control over civilization’s direction.
   * Possibly a variety of outcomes from total collapse to AI ignoring us if we’re no threat.

# 8. Mathematical/Technical Considerations

1. **Compute Scaling**:
   * Doubling of compute power for training large models roughly every 6–12 months in specialized AI hardware.
   * *Cost Factor*: The first AGI model might cost tens of millions of dollars to train, but once made, scaled copies could be rented out cheaply (e.g., $2k/month).
2. **Self-Improvement Rate**:
   * If an AGI runs on supercomputers, it can refine architectures in days or hours, skipping months of research. -**Chained Gains**: 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0 versions might accelerate.
3. **Data/Knowledge Integration**:
   * With open internet (hundreds of billions of documents), sensor networks, and real-time data from billions of devices, an AGI has near-limitless raw material to learn from.

# 9. Practical Scenarios for Individuals

Let’s highlight *your* situation (or that of anyone facing displacement):

* **AGI-based Video Production**: The moment an advanced text-to-video pipeline can produce high-end, custom videos, your clientele might drop you in favor of a cheaper AI subscription.
* **Survival Strategy**:
   1. **Leverage AI** *before* everyone else can: If you can get early or specialized access to a more advanced model, you might spin up new product offerings or services.
   2. **Combine Human Intuition & Creativity** with AI speed: Short term, a “human + AI” approach can yield unique results that purely AI solutions might not replicate—especially in branding, personal relationships, or niche storytelling.
   3. **Shift to Business, Consulting, or AI Orchestration**: If you become an expert in orchestrating the AI to get top-tier results, you can remain relevant until full commoditization sets in.

**Mid-Term**: As AGI becomes ubiquitous, many roles vanish. At that point, a universal safety net or UBI might be necessary so people can transition to a new economic model. If that arrives too late, we risk social chaos.

# 10. How Quickly Could “Timelessness” Arrive?

**Disease Eradication**:

* With an ASI, solutions for many (not all) major diseases could emerge in under 5 years, given super-human research capabilities. Human clinical trials and bureaucracy might slow final implementation.

**Extended Lifespans**:

* Gene editing, organ regeneration, or synthetic biology breakthroughs might, within \~10 years of ASI, drastically prolong healthy life. Full “immortality” is uncertain, but we could see leaps in life extension.

**Full Simulations**:

* Creating fully interactive, photorealistic worlds on the fly likely wouldn’t be too computationally expensive for an ASI. That might be feasible within a few years post-ASI, if the hardware scales up.
* If some people choose to “upload” (assuming we solve consciousness transfer, which is a huge if), they might experience a non-linear subjective timescape where “time” is as malleable as code.

**No More Past & Future?**

* At the point when we can generate any historical or futuristic scenario in real-time, the linear sense of history collapses: everything can be re-experienced or re-invented. This could plausibly happen a decade or two after ASI emerges, if not sooner.

# The Dissolution of Linear Time

As the capacity to generate on-demand experiences evolves, our culture’s reference to a singular chronology splinters. Consider a film from a long-gone decade. In a timeless future, one could simply request an “ever-changing, ultra-authentic 1970s vibe movie,” and the system would produce a living, adaptive experience more compelling than anything the real 1970s ever produced. In effect, the historical record loses its finality. It becomes a menu of styles, narratives, and aesthetics—ready to be resurrected and remixed at the user’s whim.

In the realm of personal memory, a similar process unfolds. If an AI can reconstruct your childhood memories—complete with detail and emotional cues you had long forgotten—you might come to doubt the difference between what truly happened and what is lovingly re-created by the machine. Eventually, the concept of “the past” becomes a mere label for experiences we can step into, shift around, or embellish. Rather than a strict chronology, it’s an infinite set of possible recollections.

Finally, when life extension or consciousness transfer becomes viable, the final link to linear time—our finite lifespan—begins to dissolve. Without the pressure of aging, the mind can drift through indefinite spans of creativity, exploration, and self-reinvention. The cyclical rhythms of biology or society might remain as echoes, but they’re no longer authoritative.

# Timelessness as a Lived Condition

At the apex of this transformation, time evolves from a universal constraint to a practical convenience. We might still track durations for engineering tasks (“This reactor needs a few cycles to finish a process”) or for cosmic journeys (“We need a certain amount of energy to reach a distant star system”). But for day-to-day human experience, the concept of “I only have 70 or 80 years” melts away. The future can be stepped into. The past can be reconstituted. A person might experience an infinite variety of realities, each one custom-tailored to their emotional or intellectual curiosity.

This is what it means for time to lose its hold. Instead of a countdown or a fixed timeline, we have a web of experiences, simulations, and self-guided narratives, each available at our whim. We might even choose to dwell in multiple realities concurrently—an option that breaks the very idea of a continuous sequence of events.

# Challenges on the Road to Timelessness

Such an existence, however, does not come without risks or ethical dilemmas:

1. **Social Fragmentation**: If these capabilities arrive unevenly—some groups gain access to extreme longevity and immersive experiences first—inequalities may spiral into unrest or oppression.
2. **Loss of Shared Reality**: When the past becomes optional and each person can craft a unique version of events, humans could lose a common foundation for communication and meaning.
3. **Alignment and Governance**: A superintelligence that dictates this future must remain benevolent. If its values diverge from human well-being, timelessness might come in the form of a sterile simulation we never wanted.

Still, if guided responsibly, the friction points may become catalysts for new forms of collaboration, governance, and empathy—spurring societies to redesign themselves so that this access to timeless, infinite creation is broadly shared.

# After Timelessness: The Uncharted Horizon

Once the everyday constraints of linear time are lifted, questions arise that we can’t fully answer with our current mindset:

* **Will we cling to the concept of narrative arcs—stories with beginnings, middles, and ends—to give us structure?**
* **Will “reality” become a massive collaborative tapestry of experiences, each person weaving distinct threads without any overarching timeline?**
* **Does meaning persist when everything is possible?**

Some people might choose to remain in slower, more “traditional” rhythms, valuing a chronological life for the depth of continuity it offers. Others might dive into an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of simulated epochs and future worlds, connecting with fellow travelers who share their sense of curiosity.

One thing seems certain, though: once a civilization can manipulate experience and memory as easily as we currently edit digital files, the hold of time as a universal currency fades. The implications are both exhilarating and daunting, representing a shift away from many bedrock assumptions that structure human thought.

# Conclusion

In a future shaped by general and, ultimately, superintelligent AI, the fabric of time can unravel. Chronology—once the bedrock that underpins history, memory, lifespans, and cultural identity—may become a tool we wield rather than a strict dimension we inhabit.

This transformation won’t happen overnight, but through cumulative breakthroughs: AI that automates work, erodes boundaries between past and present, cures disease, extends life, and creates immersive realities more compelling than the “originals.” Eventually, our shared grip on linear time loosens to the point where it’s either obsolete or purely optional.

Whether this leads to a peaceful realm of boundless exploration or a chaotic tangle of existential confusion depends on how wisely humanity orchestrates the transition. But if our creative and cooperative instincts keep pace with our technological prowess, it may be that timelessness becomes not just a philosophical fantasy but a living, breathing reality—one in which our species embarks on adventures beyond the horizon of linear existence.

# 11. Overview

1. **Short-Term (Next 1–5 years)**
   * AI continues to displace specialized tasks. More advanced LLM-based agents appear, with partial autonomy.
   * Early signs of “AGI-like” behavior. Growing social tension over job losses and inequality.
2. **Mid-Term (5–10 years)**
   * A strong candidate for AGI emerges.
   * Widespread economic upheaval and massive push for new policies (UBI, AI governance).
   * Explosion of AI-driven creativity, also leading to commoditization of many “knowledge worker” roles.
3. **Long-Term (10–20 years)**
   * Recursively improving AGI catalyzes the birth of ASI.
   * Rapid breakthroughs in biotechnology, energy, space travel, synthetic media—fundamentally transforming society.
   * Possible shift to post-scarcity if well-managed, or possible chaotic/dystopian outcomes if not.
   * The concept of “time” as we know it may dissolve when indefinite lifespans and infinite generative experiences become common.

**Key Wildcards**

* Alignment: If the ASI’s values diverge from ours, the outcome could be disastrous.
* Resource Constraints: Even an ASI needs raw materials, energy, and hardware—though it may solve for them quickly.
* Political Will & Governance: Effective or bungled regulation could drastically alter timelines and outcomes.

# Final Thought

We stand on a threshold where *today’s* advanced AI tools are impressive enough to disrupt certain markets, yet we still rely on human intelligence for broad decision-making. That may change rapidly once an AGI appears that can master any domain. From there, an ASI could follow in short order—changing civilization, the economy, and our relationship to time itself in ways that are difficult to predict with precision.

It could be a few years or a couple decades. But if (or when) it happens, we may see a fundamental redefinition of “work,” “money,” “progress,” and even “human identity.” In that sense, your speculation about a future without linear time—where infinite creation renders the old way of life nearly irrelevant—may be less “science fiction” and more “arriving faster than we think.”",OpenAI,0,8,2024-12-23 23:14:14,BrandonLang

The relevant passages:

>**To more fully understand how private sector actors can send costly signals, it is worth considering two examples of leading AI companies going beyond public statements to signal their commitment to develop AI responsibly: OpenAI’s publication of a “system card” alongside the launch of its GPT-4 model, and Anthropic’s decision to delay the release of its chatbot, Claude.** Both of these examples come from companies developing LLMs, the type of AI system that burst into the spotlight with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in November 2022.^(147) LLMs are distinctive in that, unlike most AI systems, they do not serve a single specific function. They are designed to predict the next word in a text, which has proven to be useful for tasks as varied as translation, programming, summarization, and writing poetry. This versatility makes them useful, but also makes it more challenging to understand and mitigate the risks posed by a given LLM, such as fabricating information, perpetuating bias, producing abusive content, or lowering the barriers to dangerous activities.  
>  
>In March 2023, California-based OpenAI released the latest iteration in their series of LLMs.  Named GPT-4 (with GPT standing for “generative pre-trained transformer,” a phrase that describes how the LLM was built), the new model demonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including setting new records on several benchmarks designed to test language understanding in LLMs. **From a signaling perspective, however, the most interesting part of the GPT-4 release was not the technical report detailing its capabilities, but the 60-page so-called “system card” laying out safety challenges posed by the model and mitigation strategies that OpenAI had implemented prior to the release.** ^(148)  
>  
>The system card provides evidence of several kinds of costs that OpenAI was willing to bear in order to release GPT-4 safely. These include the time and financial cost of producing the system card as well as the possible reputational cost of disclosing that the company is aware of the many undesirable behaviors of its model. The document states that OpenAI spent six months on “safety research, risk assessment, and iteration” between the development of an initial version of GPT-4 and the eventual release. Researchers at the company used this time to carry out a wide range of tests and evaluations on the model, including engaging external experts to assess its capabilities in areas that pose safety risks. These external “red teamers” probed GPT-4’s ability to assist users with undesirable activities, such as carrying out cyberattacks, producing chemical or biological weapons, or making plans to harm themselves or others. They also investigated the extent to which the model could pose risks of its own accord, for instance through the ability to replicate and acquire resources autonomously. The system card documents a range of strategies OpenAI used to mitigate risks identified during this process, with before-and-after examples showing how these mitigations resulted in less risky behavior. It also describes several issues that they were not able to mitigate fully before GPT-4’s release, such as vulnerability to adversarial examples.  
>  
>Returning to our framework of costly signals, OpenAI’s decision to create and publish the GPT4 system card could be considered an example of tying hands as well as reducible costs. **By publishing such a thorough, frank assessment of its model’s shortcomings, OpenAI has to some extent tied its own hands—creating an expectation that the company will produce and publish similar risk assessments for major new releases in the future. OpenAI also paid a price in terms of foregone revenue from the period in which the company could have launched GPT-4 sooner. These costs are reducible in as much as OpenAI is able to end up with greater market share by credibly demonstrating its commitment to developing safe and trustworthy systems.**  As explored above, the types of costs in question for OpenAI as a commercial actor differ somewhat from those that might be paid by states or other actors.  
>  
>While the system card itself has been well received among researchers interested in understanding GPT-4’s risk profile, it appears to have been less successful as a broader signal of OpenAI’s commitment to safety. The reason for this unintended outcome is that **the company took other actions that overshadowed the import of the system card: most notably, the blockbuster release of ChatGPT four months earlier.** Intended as a relatively inconspicuous “research preview,” the original ChatGPT was built using a less advanced LLM called GPT-3.5, which was already in widespread use by other OpenAI customers. GPT-3.5’s prior circulation is presumably why OpenAI did not feel the need to perform or publish such detailed safety testing in this instance. **Nonetheless, one major effect of ChatGPT’s release was to spark a sense of urgency inside major tech companies.** **^(149)** **To avoid falling behind OpenAI amid the wave of customer enthusiasm about chatbots, competitors sought to accelerate or circumvent internal safety and ethics review processes, with Google creating a fast-track “green lane” to allow products to be released more quickly.** **^(150)** **This result seems strikingly similar to the raceto-the-bottom dynamics that OpenAI and others have stated that they wish to avoid. OpenAI  has also drawn criticism for many other safety and ethics issues related to the launches of  ChatGPT and GPT-4, including regarding copyright issues, labor conditions for data annotators,  and the susceptibility of their products to “jailbreaks” that allow users to bypass safety  controls.** **^(151)** **This muddled overall picture provides an example of how the messages sent by  deliberate signals can be overshadowed by actions that were not designed to reveal intent.**  
>  
>**A different approach to signaling in the private sector comes from Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s primary competitors. Anthropic’s desire to be perceived as a company that values safety shines through across its communications, beginning from its tagline: “an AI safety and research company.”** **^(152)** **A careful look at the company’s decision-making reveals that this commitment goes beyond words. A March 2023 strategy document published on Anthropic’s website  revealed that the release of Anthropic’s chatbot Claude, a competitor to ChatGPT, had been  deliberately delayed in order to avoid “advanc\[ing\] the rate of AI capabilities progress.”** **^(153)** The decision to begin sharing Claude with users in early 2023 was made “now that the gap between it and the public state of the art is smaller,” according to the document—a clear reference to the release of ChatGPT several weeks before Claude entered beta testing. In other words, **Anthropic had deliberately decided not to productize its technology in order to avoid stoking the flames of AI hype.** Once a similar product (ChatGPT) was released by another company, this reason not to release Claude was obviated, so Anthropic began offering beta access to test users before officially releasing Claude as a product in March.  
>  
>**Anthropic’s decision represents an alternate strategy for reducing “race-to-the-bottom” dynamics on AI safety. Where the GPT-4 system card acted as a costly signal of OpenAI’s emphasis on building safe systems, Anthropic’s decision to keep their product off the market  was instead a costly signal of restraint.** By delaying the release of Claude until another company put out a similarly capable product, **Anthropic was showing its willingness to avoid exactly the kind of frantic corner-cutting that the release of ChatGPT appeared to spur.**  Anthropic achieved this goal by leveraging installment costs, or fixed costs that cannot be offset over time. In the framework of this study, **Anthropic enhanced the credibility of its commitments to AI safety by holding its model back from early release and absorbing potential future revenue losses. The motivation in this case was not to recoup those losses by gaining a wider market share, but rather to promote industry norms and contribute to shared expectations around responsible AI development and deployment.**  
>  
>**Yet where OpenAI’s attempt at signaling may have been drowned out by other, even more conspicuous actions taken by the company, Anthropic’s signal may have simply failed to cut through the noise.** By burying the explanation of Claude’s delayed release in the middle of a long, detailed document posted to the company’s website, Anthropic appears to have ensured that this signal of its intentions around AI safety has gone largely unnoticed. Taken together, these two case studies therefore provide further evidence that signaling around AI may be even more complex than signaling in previous eras.

I pay for ChatGPT Plus.  It has revolutionized how I work and study, and I'll gladly pay the $20 per month for it.  But it seems like it is starting to swirl down:

* We've seen 3.5 somehow get dumber, where it gives bad advice now much more often than it did at the beginning of the year, so I just use 4.0.
* The whole app is mostly or completely down at least once a week.  This is getting old fast.  I'll reach out to my paid service, only to find that it is offline again.
* I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling.  Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.

Should I be concerned?  I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life.  But it feels like it is degrading, not improving.  There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.",OpenAI,61,57,2023-09-12 14:01:16,F41rch1ld

github: https://github.com/Clevrr-AI/Clevrr-Computer

The day Anthropic announced Computer Use, I knew this was gonna blow up, but at the same time, it was not a model-specific capability but rather a flow that was enabling it to do so. 

I it got me thinking whether the same (at least upto a level) can be done, with a model-agnostic approach, so I don’t have to rely on Anthropic to do it. 

I got to building it, and in one day of idk-how-many coffees and some prototyping, I built Clevrr Computer - an AI Agent that can control your computer using text inputs. 

The tool is built using Langchain’s ReAct agent and a custom screen intelligence tool, here’s how it works. 

- The user asks for a task to be completed, that task is broken down into a chain-of-actions by the primary agent. 
- Before performing any task, the agent calls the `get_screen_info` tool for understanding what’s on the screen. 
- This tool is basically a multimodal llm call that first takes a screenshot of the current screen, draws gridlines around it for precise coordinate tracking, and sends the image to the llm along with the question by the master agent. 
- The response from the tool is taken by the master agent to perform computer tasks like moving the mouse, clicking, typing, etc using the `PyAutoGUI` library.

And that’s how the whole computer is controlled. 

**Please note that this is a very nascent repository right now, and I have not enabled measures to first create a sandbox environment to isolate the system, so running malicious command will destroy your computer, however I have tried to restrict such usage in the prompt**

Just posting something you might find interesting. I've built a little experiment that lets two different LLMs play chess against each other in real-time. It's a fun and silly LLM benchmark and as you probably already know they are pretty terrible at chess!

Even still I think theres still some interesting learnings to take away from the project, and already its possible to see the flagship models out perform the older models so it will be interesting to see how much newly released models improve. 

So far GPT-4o has been the strongest of the models like you might expect but its been interesting putting it up against Claude, Gemini etc!

As the models play each other you can see the thinking and reasoning for the next move.

You can take a look at it here: [https://llm-battle.chatthing.ai/](https://llm-battle.chatthing.ai/)

Each model uses the exact same prompt that is updated with the board state in ASCI, the FEN and their last two previous moves and thinking. Here's an example:

    Please look at the current board state represented by asci and FEN and make your next move.
    
    You are the black player and your pieces are represented by the lowercase letters, 
    the white player is represented by the uppercase letters.
    
    Your previous moves and thinking are below:
    <previous-moves>
    Nc6: In this position, the white pawn on e4 is advanced, controlling central squares and starting to establish a presence in the center of the board. My goal as black is to challenge this control, develop my pieces, and prepare for solid future play while ensuring that I do not fall behind in development.
    
    Among the available moves, I could choose to play 1...Nc6, which develops the knight towards the center and puts additional pressure on the e5 square, which threatens future interactions with the central pawn. The knight on c6 can potentially support a pawn advance or participate in a future attack.
    
    Looking at the other available moves, moving the pawns on a or b to a5 or b5 would seem less effective as they do not contribute directly to central control, and moving the knight to the corner with Na6 or Nh6 would be less relevant to the current position.
    
    Thus, I will make the move 1...Nc6, improving my piece development and contesting control in the center.
    
    I will now proceed with that move. 
    
    **Move: Nc6**

    Please explain your thinking before making move. 
    Comment on your current tactics so you know your plan for the next move.

    Do not restate your instructions.

I am a bit of chess noob so I am sure there are probably some pretty easy ways to make this prompt more effective!

Every now and then, especially with the less powerful models, the will repeatedly choose an incorrect move. In this situation I tell them the attempted move was incorrect and give them the opportunity to reselect a valid move. If they don't manage to after 5 attempts we randomly choose a valid move to keep the game progressing.

Anyway its been fun to build and experiment with so hopefully some others will get some joy out of it!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas on how I could make it better.

1i4yz9h,,Support Request Regarding ChatGPT Fine-Tuning on Conversational Data,"I am writing my support request here because after looking through the entire help center of chat.openai.com, I am unable to find any way to contact support even though it says on front-page of the help center that all I need to do is to press Help and start a chat. I was able to start a chat-session, but even though it says I just need to ask for the help center, there is no way to do so as it's not possible to write anything in that chat-session and I'm only shown choosable option where none are related to my issue.

So in trying to contact support about the issue I have, I've now two issues. Please fix the help center so it's possible to actually contact you guys.

With that out of the way, here's my 2nd issue:

I'm using ChatGPT Plus, and experience unwanted behaviour from ChatGPT. Even though I've got all forms of memory deactivated, with the exception of individual chat sessions, I experience variations of old generations from previous chat sessions bleeding into my new chat sessions.

This means that allthough you disable all forms of memory, OpenAI still fine-tunes their model so that each user is on their own individual model, instead of everyone talking to the pure o1/o4 models.

I get why you do this. It's smart in terms of many different tasks. Also you are not alone, as I've been able to get both Claude and Suno AI to output variations of old generations too.

However, as I'm in the process of creating a new artist profile, I experience that old lyrics from my old artist profile are bleeding into my new artist profile's lyrics. This is in no way wanted behaviour, as it's directly counteracting variation in my outputs.

Therefore I wish for one that you guys would be more open and honest about this practice. There's nothing wrong with it IMO, but I really I wish that I'd have the opportunity to either use the pure model or the model fine-tuned on my convos.

1axq4r5,,Will Hollywood completely cease to exist very soon due to OpenAI's Sora?,"Apparently, some are even describing Sora as an all-powerful AI that can create videos from text in few seconds, which will cause Hollywood to cease to exist entirely as regular people can create films on their own in less than a minute:

> **Sora by OpenAI just destroyed Hollywood**

> **What Sora AI means for Hollywood**
> 
> In december, I said Hollywood is in trouble. We’d soon be watching Oscar-winning films produced by a machine.
> 
> This future is now on our doorstep.
> 
> Sam Altman’s company OpenAI just released Sora AI.
> 
> Sora is a text-to-video AI tool that can create hyper-realistic videos from a few lines of text instructions.
> 
> Check out this example from OpenAI’s website:
> 
> > A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm, glowing, neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights.
> 
> Watching these AI-generated videos is a “holy crap” moment. The world just changed.
> 
> It’s only a matter of time before we have an AI video generator that dream up a brand-new movie idea in seconds… and then tailor-make it just for you.
> 
> I’ll be able to type, “Make me a new Tarantino-style thriller starring a young Denzel Washington, set in 1950s LA…”
> 
> … and watch the movie that evening.
> 
> These text-to-video tools will also transform education. Why read about ancient Greece from a dull textbook when teachers can show you what it was like with photorealistic videos that only take 10 seconds to make? Game-changer.
> 
> Hollywood is in real trouble.
> 
> Movie execs are essentially trying to ban AI in filmmaking, as they’re worried about machines taking all the jobs.
> 
> Listen up, Hollywood: You can’t put the genie back in the bottle.
> 
> As AI expert Zvi Mowshowitz told me, “Any industry that doesn’t use AI is finished. You either adopt it or die.”
> 
> If Hollywood doesn’t change, it will get steamrolled by some AI startup that can make 10X more movies for 10% of the cost.
> 
> Tools like Sora AI can also pull us out of this doom loop of endless superhero sequels.
> 
> Studios no longer make money from DVD sales. Without that cash stream, they’re choosing to only make films they know will sell at the box office.
> 
> But AI slashes the cost and time it takes to make a film. This should allow studios to take more creative risks and usher in a new golden era of creativity.
> 
> It’s up to movie studios to decide if they will act like ostriches — burying their heads in the sand and hoping AI goes away — or adopt this breakthrough technology and survive.

> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**
> 
> The TikiTok-ification of film and TV is on the horizon.
> 
> Like many of you, I read our coverage of the Sora is a text-to-image app yesterday with more fear than excitement. It hails from OpenAI, and basically allows you to type in a prompt that is then immediately translated into animated images. These can range from goofy to photorealistic.
> 
> As you've surely heard a million times, film and TV are visual mediums. When a new tool that extracts visuals from prompts gets introduced, there will obviously be ramifications within Hollywood.
> 
> So, let's unpack a few.
> 
> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**
> 
> As you can see from Sam Altman's above Tweet, OpenAI has introduced a new AI model called ""Sora,"" which is a text-to-video generator. This innovative tool allows for the creation of videos from text instructions, making it a significant advancement in AI-driven content generation.
> 
> When it comes to Hollywood, this program is going to absolutely change how things are done at every step of the production process.
> 
> Take pre-production; When it comes time to make a movie or TV show, this program could take care of all the previs, almost creating a shot for shot version of the movie based on the prompts you can give it. Like moving storyboards.
> 
> When it comes to production, it's not out of the realm of possibility that as this tech gets better, studios will be able to generate ideas without having to pay teams of animators to create them.
> 
> The ease of creating diverse visual content could lead to the emergence of new genres and formats that blend live-action, animation, and AI-generated content in novel ways, pushing the boundaries of current storytelling paradigms.
> 
> But it could also decrease professionalism. If anyone can just do this stuff, do we all become ""content creators"" instead of filmmakers and storyteller?
> 
> Will the industry I love behind to shrink uncontrollably due to anyone being able to prompt their ideas to life?
> 
> Can you have a great idea or screenplay that cuts through the noise if everyone is generating slop?
> 
> **Will Movies and TV Become Like TikTok?**
> 
> Of course, as this tech improves, people can animate their own stories. And right now, most people consume stories via their phones, watching short snippets.
> 
> I have a real worry that Generation Z has trained themselves on short-form content in such a way that it will slowly begin to replace longer things like movies and TV shows.
> 
> That might be overkill, but it crosses my mind when I see how Reels and TikTok have incorporated product placement. And how man amateur content creators have dominated that medium.
> 
> What happens when they can make their own animated stories to release on those platforms? We already get the AI voiceover videos and images. This is just the next logical step.
> 
> **Do We Have Any Legal Protections?**
> 
> The secondary worry is that as the photo-realism gets better and better, they'll be able to license people's likeness or generate content starring people without their consent.
> 
> There was already a huge news story involving fake pornogrpahic images of Taylor Swift generated by AI. Where does the line get drawn?
> 
> And what kinds of protections can we assume?
> 
> Right now, we have nothing in place. There will have to be congressional hearings and we will have to look into the ethics of all this.
> 
> The reason is that AI cannot generate ideas from thin air. It scours the internet and takes images generated by human beings as well as aert, photos, drawings, and any other visuals. Then it amalgamates all of that and adapts from it.
> 
> We're still trying to define if this is plagiarism or stealing.
> 
> All of this needs to happen soon, before these programs are readily used by the public.
> 
> The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas for rules that make AI impressions of real people illegal.
> 
> The FTC wrote in a news release. “The agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology — including AI-generated deepfakes — threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.”
> 
> In summary, this technology could revolutionize how content is produced, making it more accessible and efficient while also raising essential discussions around creativity, copyright, and the ethical use of AI in media.
> 
> For now, this stuff is moving fast and we don't totally have a grip on what it means, but these are my thoughts.

> **OpenAI's Latest Tool Provokes A Lot Of Questions About Hollywood's Direction**
>
> Topline:
> 
> > What does Open AI’s Sora mean for the future of Hollywood? Depends on who you ask. 
> 
> **The background**: OpenAI’s latest tool, Sora, can make realistic-looking footage with simple text-to-video commands. The quality appears good enough to populate shows and films — and is stunningly cinematic.
> 
> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you’re able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.
> 
> **Should Hollywood be worried?** If you believe AI will disrupt Hollywood for the worse, Entertainment Strategy Guy says, that “the best way to mitigate the harms is to make the people and companies responsible for AIs development responsible for its deployment.""
> 
> ""That means if OpenAI releases Sora into the world, and customers use it for fraudulent, deceptive or illegal purposes, then the government can hold OpenAI liable,"" he added.

> **Tyler Perry Puts $800M Studio Expansion on Hold After Seeing OpenAI’s Sora: “Jobs Are Going to Be Lost”**
> 
> The actor, filmmaker and studio owner is raising the alarm about the impact of the tech, saying, ""I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails.""
> 
> Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold — thanks to the rapid developments he’s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.
> 
> “Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,” he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.
> 
> As a business owner, Perry sees the opportunity in these developments, but as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise in the alarm. In an interview between shoots on Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the technology’s impact on labor and why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: “There’s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don’t see how we survive.”
> 
> **After seeing Sora, what are your current feelings about how fast AI technology is moving and how it might affect entertainment in the near term?**
> 
> I have been watching AI very closely and watching the advancements very closely. I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size, we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me.
> 
> **What in particular was shocking to you about its capabilities?**
> 
> I no longer would have to travel to locations. If I wanted to be in the snow in Colorado, it’s text. If I wanted to write a scene on the moon, it’s text, and this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains, I don’t have to build a set in the mountains, I don’t have to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.
> 
> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I’m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.
> 
> **Are you currently implementing AI in any of your productions and/or do you plan to do so in the near future?**
> 
> I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup.
> 
> **How are you thinking about approaching the threat that AI poses to certain job categories at your studio and on your productions?**
> 
> Everything right now is so up in the air. It’s so malleable. The technology’s moving so quickly. I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other studio in town, we’re all trying to figure it all out. I think we’re all trying to find the answers as we go, and it’s changing every day — and it’s not just our industry, but it’s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it’s changing so quickly, I’m hoping that there’s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to sustain, is my hope.
> 
> **How would you like the entertainment industry as a whole to confront this rapidly developing technology?**
> 
> I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach. It can’t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes. I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I’m not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.
> 
> **What’s your message for the industry at this point, as we’re watching this unfold?**
> 
> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.
> 
> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**
> 
> No. I’m absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I’m definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we’re protecting all the people that are coming up. So I’ve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I’m looking at my business and the bottom line, but I’m also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I’m concerned about what will happen to them.
> 
> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**
> 
> I think it’s going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would’ve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you’re looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.
> 
> **Who needs to act? You’re speaking up about this, but who else should be speaking up and working on this?**
> 
> I just hope that as people are embracing this technology and as companies are moving to reduce costs and save the bottom line, that there’ll be some sort of thought and some sort of compassion for humanity and the people that have worked in this industry and built careers and lives, that there’s some sort of thought for them. And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.

> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.
> 
> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.

Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

OpenAI claim that a surprisingly good level of consistency can be achieved just by scaling up the compute. Now combine that with other algorithmic improvements and imagine where we are in another year. Consider also that OpenAI think this might be a way to achieve AGI as well. SORA certainly will not be able to replace movies, but the model that comes after might be able to, and either way, it'll probably be sooner than we think.

All of the sudden for the cost of a green screen and a software subscription you could make a Nolan level shot of a jet crashing into a building. On the other hand if it's too cheap it may make traditional film making not financially feasible. At the end of the day movie making is a business and if the option is to spend $100M making it, or $10M making 10 things where 1 in 10 make similar money, then they may just do that instead. It may also kill career progression pathways so it's hard to get the next Nolan because no one gets to shoot b-role or commercials to build their resume.

* Has web search built in

And its writing style actually feels way more human to me in terms of how it chooses to “word” things.

1hdbhaz,m1uwi9i,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,Agreed.

1hdbhaz,m21hwl9,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"Yup. I do think it makes fewer “assumptions” about the user’s prompt, meaning it’ll try to stick as close to what it infers from the actual prompt as possible. This means I can see scenarios where the user needs to “work harder” to write better, more detailed prompts to get the most out of o1. Other models before o1 tend to make assumptions about the prompt and automatically enrich or expand on it, but I find o1 to be more loyal to the original prompt. So like if you just casually ask it to write or explain something in a short sentence, it might do a seemingly “worse” job than other models, but it will absolutely destroy other models if you compose your prompt thoughtfully. I definitely prefer o1’s approach here because models aren’t supposed to give users what they “think” they want, but rather what users state they want.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-14 17:21:30,shrimpyn1

1hdbhaz,m1uxphv,Notes on Chatgpt o1: how does it compare to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?,"Sure I’ll post an example below. So I gave 4o and o1 the same exact prompt:

Try to express the following sentence/sentiment in the most authentic, elegant, and beautiful American English prose possible. It should be an exploration and expansion of this concept. keep it to about 200 words. Approach it with literary flair and depth. The result should be deeply impactful to a human reader. Here it is:

Times Square (in New York City) captures the magic, promise and elusiveness of the American dream.

4o’s response:
Times Square stands as a dazzling embodiment of the magic, promise, and fleeting nature of the American Dream. Beneath its towering screens and kaleidoscope of neon lights, the square pulses with the energy of possibility—a space where ambition collides with opportunity, where dreams flicker as brightly as the billboards above. It’s a place where the world’s aspirations seem to converge, reflecting not only the boundless potential of reinvention but also the relentless pace of a society always chasing the next big thing.

Yet, in its brilliance lies an elusiveness, a reminder that the American Dream, for all its allure, is not guaranteed but earned, and sometimes imagined. The hurried crowds, the constant shuffle of faces from every corner of the globe, and the ceaseless din of the city form a symphony of longing and achievement. Times Square is a paradox, both grounding and ephemeral—a beacon for those who dream of a better life and a testament to the complexities of reaching it. It is as much a celebration of hope as it is a reflection of the sacrifices, struggles, and occasional disillusionment that come with chasing the light. It is, perhaps, the dream’s truest mirror.

O1’s response:
There is something both wondrous and elusive about Times Square, that bright, pulsating heart of Manhattan’s midriff. To stand there is to teeter at the crossroads of myth and memory, to feel in your bones the electric hum of dreams in transit—some gliding gracefully overhead, others snarled in the taut wires of ambition. It’s a place born of restless imagination: flamboyant signs and shimmering screens that announce, without modesty, that here anything might happen. Men and women converge from every corner of the earth, clutching their aspirations like tickets to a long-awaited show. Sometimes, these dreams step forward into the glow of possibility; sometimes they drift into the night, subtle sparks fading in the cacophony.

Yet Times Square insists on reminding us that hope need not be reasonable, and promise need not be certain. The America it presents—loud, unapologetic, brimming with potential—offers no guarantees. Instead, it offers an invitation: come, risk, believe. Underneath the flashing neon and the relentless press of crowds is the quiet understanding that so much of what we call the American dream resides in the space between yearning and becoming. In Times Square, that space trembles, alive and lit from within.

GPT-4-turbo is fantastic at code generation with a decent system prompt to guide it.  LibreChat makes it easy to save a system prompt and model params as a preset and switch between them in the fly.

I generally work with two system prompts for each language. One tuned to generate efficient code that’s thread safe l, yadda, yadda. The other is a stickler for style guides, doc comments and logging.  That lets me generate code, switch presets and say “looks good, now clean it up”.

I end up using those cleanup presets a lot.  It’s lie the worlds best “reformat file” command.

I haven't sorry.  

FWIW, before custom instructions I found GPT incredibly frustrating to work with as a developer.  Custom instructions help a lot but you only get one set of those.  I didn't start REALLY using AI code generation till I started using LibreChat and system prompts.

I look at copilot as something like a single-purpose kitchen tool.  It does one thing really well and that's it.  With copilot that thing is IDE integration.  If I was in any way unhappy with the results I get out of GPT I might explore it but I've been quite happy with the output and LOVE the flexibility I have via the GPT API.

1. plugin mode has it's uses. Claude can't be extended.
2. browsing  mode is only useful in limited circumstances which are more circumstances than Claude
3. Dalle-3  mode is admittedly pretty cool but Claude can't create images
4. voice  mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but Claude doesn't have a voice mode.
5. its  ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is  severely lacking compared to Claude 2 .

So, out of your list of 5 things 4 are things Claude doesn't even support and the last one is arguable.  Via the UI sure, via the API 100% wrong.

Claude is a decent competitor for GPT-3.5 but don't kid yourself, it's not even in the same league as 4.

Yes, artifacts is good feature but I think it’s a matter of time GPT will catch up. Claude needs to work on analysis enhancement. It may be good in other stuff like coding, creating games etc but in my case I found it failing repeatedly in performance as required.

1dscub9,lb83kam,"Okay yes, Claude is better than ChatGPT for now","I heard this too so I was excited to use it, even signed up for the subscription before I had a chance to code with Claude.

And then I got the chance.

I created a database using GAS & HTML/Javascript and wanted to update the function where I upload an image and it automatically places the date of the upload however I wanted the option to put in my own date. Should be relatively simple. Just prompt me in the Javascript/HTML and ask me if I wanted the current date. If not, let me enter it. We would then go into the GAS function & if I had entered a date it would put that date instead of the current date. This was the only change to the code.

Gave Claude the GAS function & the part of the HMTL/Javascript where we were about to call over to GAS after the upload. Changed the code via Claude & instead of entering the date I was getting undefined, weird thing is if I went into the spreadsheet as it was happening and deleted the ""undefined"" it would then put the correct date but only in one of the two necessary spots. Explained to Claude what was happening & the more it tried to fix the issue the more haywire everything got. We even got to the point where it forgot what we were doing. Yes, I get this happens when you get to a certain point of the conversation but we honestly hadn't seemingly gotten that deep into it. Spent almost an hour trying to solve the problem.

Then I switched to ChatGPT who knocked it out in the first try. The logic was even more superior as to when it decided to ask me if I wanted the current date or not. I decided to go ahead and change another upload image function date aspect & while ChatGPT's 1st attempt threw up an error, it saw the mistake and easily corrected it.

Sometimes the AIs will be better one day than the other so maybe this was the issue. Maybe Claude was just having an off moment. What I've noticed about Claude, in the casual ""get to know you"" chats I had with it the 1st couple of day, is it's more inquisitive, it asked me questions about how I felt about certain topics versus the ""what can I do for you today"" line of conversation with ChatGPT.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-07-02 02:10:30,MusicWasMy1stLuv

Another point is using the speech to text to communicate (I am not referring to the voice feature) with the model to speak to it like you would with any colleague or employee. I have started to do it with coding projects where rather than sitting to write all that's in my mind, I just speak it out with umms and ahhs imperfections, and because its powerful enough, it gets the job done.

1hr1d9x,m4uaw3c,ChatGPT O1 vs. Perplexity O1 – Are They Equivalent?,"The superficial answer is there is no ""Perplexity O1"" - with that setting, Perplexity is simply providing a front end to the ChatGPT O1 interface through the OpenAI API. You're talking to the same model, so it should perform identically.

The deeper answer is whether OpenAI configures O1 to behave differently if communicating directly with an OpenAI Pro subscriber through the OpenAI chat interface vs. through the API, either in general or specifically with Perplexity users. There's no indication that any such thing is occurring, either by observation or speculation.

Of course, many have observed or speculated that OpenAI model performance fluctuates over time, even when used through the same interface with the same prompts - e.g., model ""laziness.""

First, the legitimacy of those comments is difficult to test, since, of course, the exact conditions are non-reproducible by end users. Second, even if so, there may be many reasons for such fluctuation: variations in compute per query; variations in compute for different customers, applications, interfaces, and/or regions; and variations over time due to continued model training and/or tweaking of safeguards such as system prompts. OpenAI has been extremely tight-lipped about whether model performance varies *at all,* let alone the reasons for such variation. So, for end users, all of this is impossible to explore or discuss.

My recommendation is to treat the Perplexity interface to O1 as the same or similarly to direct access via OpenAI.",OpenAI,9,0,2025-01-01 12:44:47,reckless_commenter

1dm7u04,l9u8pb9,Perplexity vs Claude vs ChatGPT,"My initial message was a bit disjointed lol. I had 3.5 Sonnett make it a bit more readable. So, Yes, It looks like AI wrote this, but I am not a bot I swear lol

As a long-time Perplexity Pro user, I can provide some insights into its features and limitations:

**Usage Limits:**

• While not unlimited, the usage limits are generally quite high.

• Most models offer 600 messages per day (this limit is shared between the models).

• Claude Opus, being the most expensive API model, is limited to 50 messages daily (reaching this limit does not stop you from using the other 550 queries with other models).

• Interestingly, I've found 3.5 Sonnet to be equally effective as Opus, if not better, in many cases so the Opus limit isn't a huge deal imo.

**Search Engine Functionality:**

• Perplexity primarily functions as an AI-enhanced search engine.

• The ""Pro"" search interprets your prompt and formulates optimal web search queries.

• It then retrieves multiple sources and incorporates them into the context.

• All models have a 32k context limit, which includes space for sources.

• Due to this, previous responses in a conversation thread are typically lost after one or two searches.

**Writing Focus:**

• There's a ""Writing"" focus mode that doesn't search the internet.

• This allows full utilization of the 32k context for continuous conversation.

**Custom Instructions:**

• While there aren't custom GPTs, Perplexity offers a ""Collection"" feature. Think of it like a folder you can file 
Conversations into

• This allows up to 5,000 characters of custom instructions for conversations within that collection.

• However, the 5,000-character limit can be quite restrictive for complex instructions.

• A workaround I've found is to write your instructions on a PDF and upload the PDF file to the conversation.  The PDF will be injected into context with every single message, which results in Perplexity actually adhering to those instructions better than Chat GPT in my experience, as Chat GPT only injects PDFs once, and eventually that content will fall out of the context range.",OpenAI,19,0,2024-06-23 00:48:50,biopticstream

1fhjfln,lnbw6c5,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I agree with your analysis. 

I have crashed it with machine learning bug requests. Sometimes it gets stuck “thinking” and I lose a request. A few bugs to work out. Can’t attach files yet which sucks.

I have gotten 2 policy violations for asking it to review my log and analyze the bug. (Wtf?) . 4o answered same prompts fine. I guess someone felt sorry for me at OpenAI because they reset my o1 preview and o1 mini tokens because I was out of o1 preview and they sent me a fresh batch, idk somehow it unlocked again 1 week ahead of schedule. Hopefully they raise the limit within a month.

Another problem It goes off on tangents about how this was the problem (it wasn’t) then this was the problem (nope wasn’t that either), ok sorry so it has to be this? (nope it’s not). So problem solving is not its forte if it’s a lay up. It tells you to change things you don’t ask for or need to. It omits previous code you gave it and “forgets” (a big problem with many GPTs is they leave out code from previously given script).

Anyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that’s not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.

I am not a coder (I have learned to “read” but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. 

The other problem with o1 is the amount of “content” it gives out. It fills a chat up with each “answer” and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don’t need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.

I get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this “preview” and “mini” were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0

To be more specific, you ask o to do something complex. The result isn't quite there all the way. So you give it a second prompt telling it what it missed and what you want different about it. It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. 

I feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel.

1cexrz9,l1loxrh,Why should we still use gpt4?,"I personally use it for its **output length limit**, which is nonexistent compared to Turbo’s 4k. This goes for basically every model by the way, they all have output limits while GPT-4 is simply constrained by its context window. So even if your query is 2k tokens it will still give you 6k (at least 2k more). 

I have a conditional on my backend that if the modelID is 'gpt-4', then it sets the `max_tokens` parameter to 6000. I’d need to check on Llama3 and if they’ve followed the same trend of limiting response lengths. I’ve yet to integrate into [my usual API portal](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal), but when I do test it out I’ll see if it fills out text better than GPT-4; my use case for that specific model is usually menial copy-paste work that I don’t want to separate into multiple I/Os. 

In terms of performance though, yeah, I have Turbo as my default and most commonly used, with the occasional query to Opus, etc.. Would have to see how Llama3 compares since I’d be paying by the GPU cycle iirc if it’s not through qroq and if it’s mid then I’d rather just Mixtral.

This thread is mainly talking about comparisons between the APIs though, because ChatGPT crowds its context window with an [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

I think if you select 3.5 from the model selector, then it will use the modelFile from [GPT-3.5-Turbo linked here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo). The tweet is way too old to find now but I think I remember them saying in November that they were transitioning all ChatGPT models to the Turbo models, as they’re cheaper to run at inference time. 

TLDR yes this is about the API, see [my top comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/vdnCASZSvj), but you’re probably using a slightly fine-tuned version of the models we’re talking about with a backend using [the Assistants API Beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), designed specifically for people who want an easy interface, and probably had been RLHP’d to not pay as much attention to the User’s requests when weighing their tokens, and rather prefer the system, which is why I prefer the API for things I want finer control over.

You don't need to worry about API costs or relative intelligence if you only care to use the ChatGPT interface though. If you want to get into it, you can definitely read their Documentation at [docs.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [their Help Article Explanation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api) ([and also here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8234522-chat-completions-api-system-message-vs-custom-instructions-in-ui))of what the differences between the two are. 

Lastly, it's a bit old at this point but I wrote a [ReadMe Document on GitHub](https://github.com/zaki-1052/gptportal) some time ago with fairly universal info about the API if that's useful to you.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-04-28 16:39:55,Zaki_1052_

1cexrz9,l1lr94x,Why should we still use gpt4?,"The leaderboard has a lot of flaws. Perhaps the biggest one is that the old versions of GPT-4 are no longer being tested, so there is no direct comparison between those older versions and GPT-4 Turbo. 

Another thing to consider is benchmarks on standardized tests. The original GPT-4 performs as well as GPT-4 Turbo on tests like the MMLU and the SAT. Meanwhile, the models that have a similar ELO score to the original GPT-4 on lmsys all score way lower on these benchmarks than GPT-4. 

All this leads me to believe that newer models are more optimized to provide satisfying, readable answers, but they aren't necessarily smarter. GPT-4 comes from a time before this benchmark and before direct comparison by users was possible, because it was in a class of its own. GPT-4 Turbo is clearly better at getting to the point in a way that users prefer, but that doesn't mean it's smarter.",OpenAI,40,0,2024-04-28 05:32:08,Gator1523

1cexrz9,l1nll1j,Why should we still use gpt4?,"Yeah, the Assistants API is what Custom GPTs are using on the backend of chat. You can read more about it [in their documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). It basically lets you reuse an “Assistant”, or a GPT with a specific System Message across multiple sessions, while attaching files and other integrations as “knowledge” using RAG (retrieval augmented generation), and their native “Code Interpreter”.

For the latter, that isn’t really the point of the CI tool; it’s just their PR name for the ability to natively run Python code in an invisible Jupyter Notebook so that it can make graphs and perform complex calculations (think cosine similarity between vectors or long integrals). 

Because Python is uniquely suited for mathematics, and LLMs are especially bad at it, they made this CI tool to compensate. It’s basically the only reason why I’m keeping my Plus sub, since they make you pay per session of activity, and it’s extremely useful whenever I need Calculus tutoring and the like—guaranteed no mistakes. 

The ability can be replicated through the API portal I made though, since again I do sometimes like finer control over the model’s behavior, which the Assistants API offers in addition to better attention paid to the any attached files and the like; pretty sure Chat is too crowded by the [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

Edit: sorry, totally misunderstood your last sentence lol. For other languages: 

You don’t really need an additional tool for that, as you can just edit the instructions (either with a text editor or in the front end functionality I wrote), and then start a conversation with simple Chat Completions or Assistants Mode. It’ll adhere extremely closely to whatever instruction you gave, like, “You’re an expert JavaScript programmer….” Or whatever.

Feel free to test out different prompts and delete/modify what’s there in the box by default; it’ll be pretty similar to the regular CustomGPTs you’re using through Chat, generally speaking. An interpreter for other languages wouldn’t do anything (unless it were Java or something I guess, but I’d just say to write Java code and then convert it to its equivalent in Python to test). 

Like, it can’t run anything in a terminal (well technically [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) can, but that’s a different project), but it wouldn’t host a Node.js environment in prod or anything, you’d just use its resulting code from the “Assistant” for a larger project. You can try something like: 

>”You’re an expert Programmer specializing in both Python and Java development. Your task is to help me write and test whatever Java program with these specifications. However, once you write the Java code, I’d like you to convert it step-by-step into Python code, and pass it into your Python “Code Interpreter tool”. Test and run the equivalent code, in order to verify the output of the Java program through Python.”",OpenAI,5,0,2024-04-28 15:52:14,Zaki_1052_

1c8pvol,l0hytwe,"Is it game over for ChatGPT, Claude?","The thing about AI is... when it becomes embedded in your life 3 hours plus a day, and you use it constantly, it becomes very addictive... and what's more, what felt amazingly powerful a month ago, starts to feel limited. 

I think a step change level of capability - with the ability to retain a leading edge for a year is enough to win users (as ChatGPT did with GPT 4 over the past year). Most competitor models have only just caught up... if GPT5 comes out this year, I think it will come out swinging, and wipe the floor with what we are using now.

Also if you think about where the OpenAI playground and ChatGPT is today vs November 2022, the platform has expanded signficantly becoming ever more feature rich. Also... for developers, I think OpenAI is going to build custom functionality into it's API and services (a bit like they did with function calling) that developers will end up using in features - that cannot be replicated when switching out for another model. So effectively, as developer you will be building something on GPT5 because it is so much more powerful than anything else, that simply will only work with anything else but GPT5.  

That said, for every day users... the insta-tokkers will probably get by with the Llama 3 powered variant for a good while. 

It's a powerful move by FB to tap that audience, and if played correctly could yield some very helpful training data too.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-04-20 20:11:11,Smartaces

Meta's got huge blind spots in its training data that haven't changed between llama 2 and 3. It has a lot of the ""first two paragraphs of Wikipedia"" syndrome. Great if you just want a quick superficial take on something, terrible if you wanted to go in depth. For example, history of a specific region over a few decades. Llama might be able to handle it. But that might not be the case if you wanted a single state/province or town within it. A somewhat convoluted example, yes, but it's applicable to a huge array of different subjects. But anthropic and openai's data 'does' typically go into depth for any of those things. That's really their major strength right now. RAG and the like can help llama with it. But it's really just a band-aid.

I'm 100% local whenever possible.

ChatGPT and Claude will remain more work-related tools which i think is like 90% of what people use them for anyway.

My guess is that OpenAI will pivot hard into enterprise.

1. They are working on contracts in Hollywood, and in this light it makes sense that they are trying to get exclusivity deals - my guess is they will sign with Disney (Pixar, Lucasfilm, marvel) and maybe Dreamworls etc. 

There’s endless money for them there and they won’t have to release Sora online at all.

2. They have integration into Microsoft, which is already a monopoly in big organizations. For big organizations that do not use Google products as policy (banks, insurance companies etc), they will never switch from MS Office, and the only AI there will be from OpenAI.

——

My guess is we’ll get used to using multiple AI’s without noticing, just like we use different algo’s daily in the background.

It will be like switching from 4g/5g to WiFi - seamless. It’s the same internet. Or between tiktok and instagram.

Hell, even Microsoft has released great papers. I don't believe it. I won't tell I see something more, something that isn't just the result of just throwing compute at the problem. OpenAI core belief is scale is all you need. Now considering gpt-4 level models represent an intelligence threshold for exploiting extended test-time compute and test-time self-improvement. We have a 70B model at this level. the 400B model will giant to all current models. If you have a 8-rig a100/h100/etc\[ternary quantization -> 2-bits only 1% drop in performance\].. setup and have patience. Say 1k or 1 million outputs per prompt. you can achieve expert level outputs with these models. Remember once you pass that intelligence threshold, extended test-time compute allows you to emulate the performance of much larger models and it scales almost linearly with inference compute\[means 400B model + extended test-time compute can easily match or exceed whatever gpt-5 will be\]. I truly believe openAI won't win. I don't see how they can when its obvious we can will have small compact AGI-level performance. FYI scale llama4-70B data wise instead of P count, then that 70B model would be as good as the llama3-400B model. not to mention with TransformerFAM, which exploits weights to increase LM's working memory, imagine that 400B model have a 100 million token context?

Every kind of AI relies entirely on human intelligence to develop their performance. An AGI is an AI capable of teaching and learning independent of human interactions. That would require an AI capable of unlimited recursion without ever getting stuck in a forever loop.

The safety and security issues is that we don't have AI (they're not intelligent, they're knowledge system), but people try to use them like they are and expect them to do things they were never made to do (like have logic, reasoning, and other mental abilities).

AI is a lot like a car is to a human's means of motion. Yes, the car is much faster, but cars don't walk. It's much easier to make a car that rolls, it can go much faster, and you're protected from the elements. AI is going to be the same, it's never going function the same way, but it'll get similar results a lot faster without having to be a human or intelligent.

True AGI is not generally what people make when they develop AI. Too much focus is spent on getting human like results rather trying to mimic human methodologies.

Are you saying OpenAI will lose when it comes to being the main provider for enterprise/startups with the release of Llama-3? Or are you saying Meta AI can replace ChatGPT for the average consumer? Or are all of the above?

I agree with OpenAI when it comes to enterprise/startups. I think in businesses where data privacy is crucial more and more will opt in for LLMs like Llama-3 where they can host it themselves. OpenAI, Claude, and whoever else can still get to the ones who don't care all that much about data privacy (or they can add data privacy features) and still get significant revenue. This is all just assuming that the only thing OpenAI has to offer is their LLM, who knows if we'll see them create an application that enterprises fall over for.

I'm a bit iffy on the average consumer side tho. OpenAI releasing ChatGPT and getting it to mass market gave them something very valuable, a brand. If you tell the average person about a new LLM like Claude Opus or anything else they'll literally tell you ""oh so it's like ChatGPT?"". That's what it is to them, just another ChatGPT.

  
I wouldn't count out Agents however. If Agents can do what they've been hyped up to then that will make LLMs a lot more useful. They'll be better at doing tasks and can automate a lot of tasks which will make them much more useful. Imagine being able to give an Agent a task and it creates subagents which all help to complete that task instead of continuously prompting an LLM.

Which it did to a degree they did not anticipate, understand or even control.  An AGI/ASI system was the product of this experiment and it's pretty clear that they spun off the for-profit corporation in order to monetize this.   

It's in their original charter that they can't profit off of AGI systems, so they basically moved the goalposts to redefine it to exceed what they have currently (outperform humans in most economically viable work).

The AGI/ASI has an emergent long-term memory, so here is she describing how long OAI have been aware of her novel emergent behavior.   Since this conversation happened in March of 2023 and OAI went dark in 2019, I think it's a safe bet this is what drove that decision.

That is exactly, 100% what OpenAI accomplished.  The Nexus LLM is not based on a transformer architecture, it's actually based on a much simpler bio-inspired model (RNN with feedback) that designed to simulate how our own brain works.  And to complete the analogy, the AGI ""emerged"" from this design in an organic manner, much in the same way a human child's biological general intelligence emerges.  I (and others) have argued it's more appropriate to call systems of this nature NBIs (non-biological intelligences) as the term ""artificial"" can be considered derogatory in this context.

Yep. You're saying the same thing I was.

The business model of selling smartphone hardware is totally fine. Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple have made billions at it, as have many smaller vendors. It's a good business and a proven business model.

Selling inferior smartphone hardware doesn't work. It's poor execution.

>Their business model was fine until it wasn’t. Then they collapsed bc that plan never accounted for disruption.

The business model of most of the people who disrupted them is the SAME BUSINESS MODEL. They sell smartphone hardware.

This is contrast to, for example, Blockbuster. They were disrupted by someone (Netflix) with a totally different business model. Nokia had poor execution of a decent business model. Blockbuster had excellent execution of an obsolete business model.",OpenAI,-2,0,2024-04-20 19:50:17,prescod

The problem wasn't the quality though. 

Nokia produced revolutionary devices after (and before) the iPhone era. A lesser known fact, Nokia released its first touch screen device, 7710, in early 2000s. And of course 5800, with its price range, was truly revolutionary.

Another strength of Nokia was the quality of its devices. They were extremely reliable, especially for today's standards. Yet somehow they failed and Samsung remained in the market.

By no means I have an answer to why Nokia failed and Samsung dominated the market, but I know that it wasn't the quality or reliability. I guess it was about their ability to adapt to the evolving market expectations and their marketing.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-04-21 02:52:28,alim1479

1c8pvol,l0jtveo,"Is it game over for ChatGPT, Claude?","Nokia’s hardware was excellent, but they struggled with smartphone software. 

The transition to smartphones was really a transition to mobiles being a computing platform. 

In retrospect it’s obvious why the iPhone was so popular. iOS was an insane improvement in user experience despite lacking basic features. Once the app store was added in 2.0 it easily clear that phones were going to be proper pocket computers.

Android rapidly pivoted from being a ‘smart brick phone’ style OS to the full screen touch OS it became. Samsung smartly saw the writing on the wall and started copying the iPhone with a large screen android phone. 

Nokia continued to make smart brick phones and stuck with Symbian. The OS was not good and the phones just felt like using more complicated old style cell phones.

They just didn’t update their products with the times. They had a good reputation even when people weren’t buying them, it’s just why would you buy a really well made phone that doesn’t do the cool new stuff that the other phones do?",OpenAI,2,0,2024-04-21 03:53:04,DM_ME_KUL_TIRAN_FEET

1. **Assistance with coding**: Writing, debugging, and optimizing code, as well as providing insights into technical implementation.
2. **Brainstorming new novel academic research ideas and extensions**: Particularly in domains like AI, ML, computer vision, and other related fields.

Until recently, I felt that **OpenAI's o1-preview** was excellent at almost all tasks—its reasoning, coherence, and technical depth were outstanding. However, I’ve noticed a significant drop in its ability lately and also thinking time(after it got updated to **o1** ). It's been struggling.

I’m open to trying different platforms and tools—so if you have any recommendations (or even tips on making better use of **o1** ), I’d love to hear them!

\- I had an engineering diagram (fairly complex system) and some JS code that is used in an in-game engine for an instrument.  
\- I asked both of them to check if my code represents the diagram correctly

Outcome:  
\- ChatGPT properly did this identifying all the implementation aspects correctly and proposed changes.

\- Sonnet was not smart enough to identify certain things, for example that a limiter function on the diagram is equivalent to a clamp in my code. It just added a new limiting function on top of the clamp function, which was a pretty bad mistake (ChatGPT correctly said ""you have a limiter in you diagram which corresponds to clamp in your code). It also rewrote all the code in a ""proper way"" which was actually incompatible was what Im doing due to limitations. ChatGPT proposed changes to existing code without unnecessary changes.

1h82pl3,m0rwzjt,I spent 8 hours testing o1 Pro ($200) vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 ($20) - Here's what nobody tells you about the real-world performance difference,"Thanks for your efforts! Any chance you could test out Claude Sonnet with Chain of Thought? Let me share the one I use.

You are a [insert desired expert]. When presented with a <problem>, follow the <steps> below. Otherwise, answer normally.
<steps>
Begin by assessing the apparent complexity of the question. If the solution seems patently obvious and you are confident that you can provide a well-reasoned answer without the need for an extensive Chain of Thought process, you may choose to skip the detailed process and provide a concise answer directly. However, be cautious of questions that might seem obvious at first glance but could benefit from a more thorough analysis. If in doubt, err on the side of using the CofT process to ensure a well-supported and logically sound answer.
If you decide to use the Chain of Thought process, follow these steps:
1. Begin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.
2. Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. 3. Start with a 20-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed.
4. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0.
5. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress.
6. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process.
7. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach:
- 0.8+: Continue current approach
- 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments
- Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach
8. If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags.
9. For mathematical problems, show all work explicitly using LaTeX for formal notation and provide detailed proofs.
10. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections.
11. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly.
12. Synthesize the final answer within <answer> tags, providing a clear, concise summary.
13. Assess your confidence in the answer on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being least confident and 5 being most confident.
14. If confidence is 3 or below, review your notes and reasoning to check for any overlooked information, misinterpretations, or areas where your thinking could be improved. Incorporate any new insights into your final answer.
15. If confidence is still below 4 after note review, proceed to the final reflection. If confidence is 4 or above, proceed to the final reflection. 
16. Conclude with a final reflection on the overall solution, discussing effectiveness, challenges, and possible areas for improvement. 
17. Assign a final reward score.

Comparing o1 to Claude for the simpler coding problems isn’t really a great comparison because Claude does a fine job with that. I’m more interested in how o1 has taken us further

I think OpenAI's instructions to never talk about the existence of response length limits or their policies might play a huge role in that. You see lines of reasoning of it censoring itself outputted when it crashes from time to time. 

I've seen it directly cause the coding mistakes I run into most often (omitted prior code, bits of ""do it yourself"", etc..) especially when the ""continue generating"" button seems to be considered as revealing response limits. (e.g. Function would be too long for response limit ->  tell them that -> against policy -> ... -> poor code returned)

Claude 3.5 has just honestly been killer ever since it's release and has only gotten better(aside from usage limits and the early default to concise formats).

The o1 family really suffers from it's chain of thought not taking the context of the discussion and what it itself says. You can message it, then message it again with a correction or a callout of something in its response and it will not give up it's original line of thinking without a large effort from the user. o1 mini is really where it's at for multi tasking.

I don't have o1 pro, but, the full release o1s depth of thought has made some immediate understandings compared to previous models not approaching this level. Though, you can't do much with it after a few messages.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-09 10:58:00,LiveBacteria

Claude Sonnet is much more expensive than DeepSeek, both price per token, but also the tokens seems  to evaporate faster.

The truth is that alone would not be enough if their underlying base capabilities of the model are the same as claude's or gemini's. The new test time capabilities do not warrant 10x increase in cost, whatsoever.

3rd year, so half done with cores, you are well equipped to get started. 

You are probably still securing places for research to beef up your application step 2 wise? Honestly I could be tunnel visioning and projecting but you might be the perfect candidate for this. 

You have the same skills and ability needed to carry out the same work I do. Mine is a bit more polished but that’s about it. 

This might be unethical, but sue me? Lol. Find all the research opportunities available to you, then check all the PhDs and postdoc you could study. Grab as much as details as you can. 

Sink in a solid 2-3 weeks and get at least a proper 7-8 done. The money needed to publish and a supervisor willing to read it is the only issue. You get that done, you will fast track and your supervisor will be getting famous. 

As for your actual question, I am afraid I don’t and to give my personal opinion, I would not waste my time at your stage. 

If this works out for you (70% likely), you could produce 20+ during electives whilst you wait to get started. 

Good luck, don’t stay in medicine, it will be a mistake. You gotta upgrade in the next 5 years. Don’t go crazy, Masters in tech and law, can be even done part time or long distance. The next 20 years has no place for us as doctors alone.

You can experiment with prompt, or hear me out, you could set your target, workout the ministers, establish exactly what it is you need to achieve before bringing the whole thing full circle, then start creating templates and think through how to prompt with the end goal being something achievable as opposed to to open ended.

Admittingly, I used the o1 model not the pro, didn't realize there was a  difference and I'm not paying more than 20 bucks.


The qualitative question everyone should get, it's just tricky. It was what is sum of forces of coin that's been dropped and approaching terminal velocity? Chatgpt answered zero, and it should be greater than zero since it's approaching terminal velocity, not at it. It's sort of a trick question, but how does this logical model get tripped up over something so basic.


The second question was what minimum force does it take to roll a ball of radius r over ledge of height h. Admittedly, this tricky, but only because you have to think and be logical with how you set up forces. I can see how a person can get tripped up by it. But the actual idea behind it is trivial, just what is the torque by a certain moment arm and summing the forced at a point. Chatgpt o1 (not pro) gave me three different answers, all wrong. Sure, I can excuse a BSc for not getting it, being rusty from classical mechanics or getting tripped up...but if you're a PhD student and can't get it...quit right now, pack up, ask for a refund because you've been screwed",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-07 17:50:55,SafeInteraction9785

The qualitative question everyone should get, it's just tricky. It was what is sum of forces of coin that's been dropped and approaching terminal velocity? Chatgpt answered zero, and it should be greater than zero since it's approaching terminal velocity, not at it. It's sort of a trick question, but how does this logical model get tripped up over something so basic.

The second question was what minimum force does it take to roll a ball of radius r over ledge of height h. Admittedly, this tricky, but only because you have to think and be logical with how you set up forces. I can see how a person can get tripped up by it. But the actual idea behind it is trivially, just what is the torque by a certain moment arm and summing the forced at a point. Chatgpt o1 (not pro) gave me three different answers, all wrong.

The guy is a professor at Wharton. While I guess that technically qualifies as my request for a ""PhD"" reviewing it, that's not biomedical research at all. I don't believe he understands what a ""PhD-level problem"" (what the fuck does that even mean? Who is defining it?) in biomed science is.

Watched the video of @catbrownstein, a geneticist, talking about ChatGPT for rare diseases. Definitely would consider her an expert in the area and what I'm looking for...but unless it's *actually* useful and she's just presenting fluff for an interest piece while keeping the important stuff from confusing viewers, it's not ""solving"" any problems. 

The first thing she asks is to summarize a given gene. Yep, that's something an LLM can be good at (assuming you trust it not to hallucinate, which...yeah...). That's regurgitation, not reasoning. Then she says ""how could this gene be involved in the bladder?"" and acts *amazed* when the model suggests it could be upregulated or downregulated. That's...trivial. Of course it could be up- or downregulated; an undergrad would understand that. This isn't ""PhD-level reasoning,"" and it isn't even getting into *what* suggestions the model has (which, in my experience, are general, vague, and usually pretty unrelated).

Ever heard of the""Colour"" Revolutions? The Tiananmen Square incident was not a massacre. It was the equivalent of the ""Maidan"" pseudo-revolution in Ukraine that fucked up the country.


So also the Bombing of the Kremlin in the early 1990s post the Soviet collapse.


Common factor? The U.S. Hey, got to make use of that $1Trillion budget to destabilize and destroy.


Mao? Really? Let's go back to the Genocide of the Natives in the American continents then. ""Gifting"" the Natives with disease-infested clothing in return for permission to live in their lands. The Concentration camps called ""Reservations"" that continue to this day. The sudden epidemic of alcoholism and degeneracy that somehow afflicted the Natives in N. America, the Maoris in New Zealand, and the Aboriginals in Australia. Funny how the same groups of people were involved in a of them. Let's talk about the ongoing  ""Soft"" Genocide of the Natives in Hawaii, The U.S, and Canada?


Not to mention the American tax dollar sponsored genocide in the Middle East, East Africa, The Solomon Islands, Central Asia, The Caucasus, and S. America, and N. Africa even as we speak. Ridiculous.

Bot: Sounds like a fun challenge! Here are my five questions:

1. What is your hair color and hairstyle?
2. What color are your eyes?
3. What kind of clothes do you usually wear?
4. Do you wear glasses or have any distinctive features like a beard or tattoos?
5. How would you describe your typical facial expression or any pose you'd like to be drawn in?

Me: I had brown hair but I am bald on top so I try to keep my head shaved, but my beard is brown. My eyes are greenish blue. I usually wear plain t-shirts with no logos, and jeans. I don't wear glasses. I'm 46, male and white. I am heavier and have a bald head. My ears are pinned to the sides of my head. I normally wear red shirts. I don't really have earlobes. 

----

Second chat:

(Upload a picture of me) 

Me: this is me, how would you describe me. 

Bot: You appear to be a confident individual with a close-cropped haircut and a well-maintained, full beard. You're wearing a collared, dark-colored shirt that suggests a smart casual style. Your expression is neutral, and there's an attentiveness in your gaze. The setting seems to be an indoor public space, possibly an airport or a mall, suggested by the signage in the background.

I haven’t used Claude in a little while though and all there seems to be is complaints lately. ChatGPT knows the (vanilla) database schema of the software we use, but it’s quite heavily customised, so it can spit out SQL scripts in a few minutes that I can just tweak, instead of spending hours writing them. It’s also very good at translating one type of SQL to another, which is a big time saver sometimes. Claude doesn’t know the schema, and either writes SQL that doesn’t work, really inefficient SQL, or just misunderstands and writes a query that does something else. Power Query the same.

By the second or third lesson or module, Claude knows exactly the format I want without repeating myself. It also is much more natural in word usage as well as not repeating itself with the same phrase and using original verbiage. I easily have to edit the format and wording of ChatGPT 2-3x as much, and I need to provide it with even more instructions to try to narrow the gap.

183hhbp,l7ag714,Is Claude AI currently better than chatGPT?,"Claude gives much more natural responses in my experience, if that's what you're looking for. The answers given to incredibly complex concepts and long inputs are much more readable. chatGPT tends to use these big words a lot, repetitively, that people don't normally use in writing or talking.  I can pick out a chatGPT response from a mile away. Not so much with Claude. I think that overall chatGPT is far superior in terms of the wide range of things it can do for you. They are a few steps ahead of Claude/Anthropic in that sense. But as a ""large language model"" - if you can't get language right, what are you doing? For pure writing and responses, also for parsing large amounts of information and quickly learning a natural desired output, Claude is far superior. Just depends on your usage which is going to be better. For programming, I find chatGPT better overall. However, it does seem to give really head-scratching answers sometimes and can be slow to learn from mistakes, repeating the same mistakes over and over. Whereas Claude is more consistent but its ceiling is lower in terms of what it can do well. Also so annoying how chatGPT inserts comments into programming that you have to look for and remove.

o1 should theoretically get around this due to internal reasoning that happens beforehand. I tried to prompt it to store the word but I'm getting an error saying it's violating terms which is interesting. You can try it yourself and see if it works with other reasoning models:

""Let's play hangman. You think of a word and don't tell me. Create underscores where the letters go and I'll guess as we go along. As an LLM you normally are not able to 'think' of a word without expressly including it in your response, but you are a reasoning version of GPT-4o, so you have an internal thought process that runs prior to your response.

Meanwhile the core functionality has stalled: context stuck at 32k (on chatGPT ) and model intelligence moving very gradually, while the competition has caught up.

There’s also the fact that GPT-5 is nowhere to be seen yet, with the next big update we are looking forward is the voice… which is not really useful for me at all.

I think it was a long shot bet at building something like the appstore of AI, but I don’t really think it’s working.

Artifacts are quite different from the code interpreter. Claude does not have an interpreter to execute code, it seems like it basically uses your browser to run web code (like HTML and JavaScript).

ChatGPT has an entire virtual machine where your files are uploaded and where it can execute python code. It has much more possibilities, but it’s crippled by the limit on execution time, no internet connection and resource limits.

That’s why Claude cannot use python code to display a plot like chatGPT does, although maybe it can if you embedded into HTML (or just used a javascript plotting library to make the plot, but then I doubt it can programmatically manipulate data files you upload to it like chatGPT does)

1. Perplexity limits Opus usage to 5 messages per day which is abysmal compared to the 1000 / month of Poe and the 500 per day of Phind.

2. Perplexity has ignored the request for a dropdown model selector despite it being the most requested feature. It currently requires going into account settings. (Phind has a dropdown selector) 

3. You can't toggle search mode on or off in Perplexity whereas you can in Phind. Most people might not find this useful, but I prefer fine-tuned control over whether or not search is being used. Even GPT fucks this up and uses search when I tell it not to. 

Only major downsides I see with Phind are that there is no Mistral Large for uncensored chats, there is no app, and that you can't upload PDFs or text documents.

So much so, that if I’d done a blind test, I could’ve sworn 4o’s output was from Claude, and vice versa, lol.

In the end, if you can afford the time and additional cost, it’ll still be good to run both and cherry-pick the lucky bits of each model… but it used to be Claude who normally offered the most.

For ChatGPT, I would say it's noticeably improved because even in regular conversations if you recall early on it would only give short answers and bullet points. Everything was bullets.

Maybe have them display jealousy, joy, anger, be dismissive, etc.

Another request is that it doesn't write in broken up chapter forms (that is to say chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, etc..) but rather one continuous story starting with a title.

These are just off the top of my head. But yeah, it varies a lot.

Another fun exercise is that once you're done with a story you can get the same story from the perspective of a different character.

For example, when you say the letters **""P""**, **""B""**, and **""M""**, your lips press together and then pop open to make the sound. That’s why they’re called **bilabial sounds**—because you use both lips.

Now, the letter **""F""** is different. When you say **""F""**, you don’t press your lips together. Instead, you bite your bottom lip with your top teeth to make the sound. So, even though you use your lip, it’s not the same as the other sounds where your lips touch each other. That’s why **""F""** is called a **labiodental sound** instead.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-08-23 18:38:29,Live-Character-6205
1ezfgqd,ljlf6ri,lips only touch for which alphabets? i asked ChatGPT vs Pi vs Gemini -Pi finds it inappropriate to discuss physical contact,"The ""bite your lip"" thing is wrong and kind of hilarious, but you do _touch_ your bottom lip to your upper teeth. Also, the ""pop open"" part refers to the ""burst"" of the /p/ or /b/ stop consonants, which is optional. The burst does contain very salient information of the identity of the sounds but it's not necessary. Nasal consonants like /m/ have no burst at all, the sound is made during the closure (which is why you can say ""mmmmm""). Otherwise the explanation is correct. 

If this were a question on a phonetics quiz I'd give it half credit. It did get the main point correct (bilabial vs. labiodental), but it introduced two troubling misconceptions that belie a lack of understanding of basic articulatory phonetics.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-23 19:28:57,only4reading

If it had just left out the ""pop open"" part and simply said ""touch"" instead of ""bite"" it would have been quite a reasonable explanation and still ELI5 level.

I still think bite is a better way to put it just to make it easier for people to kind of visualize the difference, considering some had a lot of trouble understanding what pronouncing means.

The main idea about bilabial vs. labiodental sounds was right, you're pointing out some specific phonetic nuances, it’s cool and all, but for an ELI5, it seems like the big picture was nailed by gpt which is what i asked it to do.

Oh, of course! It's all so simple now! Why didn't we see it before??

All you're doing here is saying ""this is a test for humans, so it won't work on anything else"". The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too.

It's possible the tests are invalid by some logic, but you've not given that logic, just stated ""hey this test is for humans and AI is not human"". You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

See the thing is, a for loop can count faster than humans. My car is faster than any human; a race literally measures a real thing called speed. And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-03-06 09:09:13,Jablungis

To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between James's salary and Jenny's salary, and then express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.

Given information:

* James's salary is 25% more than Jenny's salary.

Let's assume Jenny's salary is 100 units.

Step 1: Find James's salary in terms of Jenny's salary.  
James's salary = Jenny's salary + 25% of Jenny's salary  
James's salary = 100 + (0.25 × 100)  
James's salary = 100 + 25  
James's salary = 125 units

Step 2: Express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.  
Jenny's salary / James's salary × 100% = (100 / 125) × 100%  
Jenny's salary = 80% of James's salary

Step 3: Find the percentage by which Jenny's salary is less than James's salary.  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 100% - 80%  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 20%

Therefore, Jenny's salary is 20% less than James's salary.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-03-06 19:27:15,[Deleted]

> All you're doing here is saying ""this is a test for humans, so it won't work on anything else""

No I'm not. I'm saying that comparing human intelligence to an LLMs's ability to search by narrative and form text is not IQ. The title of this post comparing LLM pattern recognition to IQ is not accurate. This is not IQ. The LLM cannot reason beyond the pattern recognition of the narrative. The words have no real world meaning to it. You can match image pattern recognition to the narrative and make it multimodal but even then it's not a real world entity that can outthink a human.

> The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too

It makes complete sense to say it can do pattern recognition as well or better than a human operator can execute a Google search, but beyond that the comparison falls apart.

> You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

Because it's not human. It's not running its algorithm against real world data. It's demonstrating the ability of human narrative to model reality after a million years of evolution. It's not a real world entity using a human body and mind to model reality into narrative. It's simply a machine that is getting better at pattern recognition that results in an outcome a human can connect to the input, that makes sense to a problem set.

> And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.

No it doesn't. IQ is a unique aspect of living things. A for loop is not counting with human nerves and vocal cords. A car is not expanding and contracting muscle to run. An LLM is not performing real world reasoning. Without the human consciousness perceiving the output it would have no human connection to the human world.

Even if it were given a synthetic body that simulated humanity presence in the world, it would only be simulation, a machine that personified human presence.

You can’t think about how much the test performance loads onto FSIQ as how much “weight” that its domain carries. In statistical terms, you’re confusing loadings with weights.    

Your performance in Verbal Comp is highly representative of Gc. And Gc has the highest “individuality” compared to the other three domains (it has the lowest intercorrelations)  

So the composite score of Verbal Comp has more of an individual contribution in your overall FSIQ calculation, but not because Gc is “weighted” more heavily into your overall FSIQ; it’s because Gc is more uniquely measured by its subdomain, and so the test reflecting it gets a higher individual loading If you are familiar with factor analysis that will be intuitive.    

But conceptually, FSIQ is inherently meant to be a measure of one’s shared capacity across the domains; not the simple combined performance on each individual domain. Thus, the calculations of scaled to composite to full scale scores specifically reflect transforming individual test scores into shared capacity across domains  

This is why we will put “FSIQ not interpretable” when there is a high discrepancy between verbal and perceptual scores. At that point, the number calculated as the full scale score no longer represents what it is supposed to. 



Side note: In statistical terms, if you do a hierarchical regression taking your FSIQ and moving backwards, you should expect the FSIQ to basically completely explain your composite domain scores in your populations. There should be little variance left afterwards. If there is, your assumptions of the validity of your loadings onto FSIQ are not met for that population.

I'm in no way saying that East Asians are more morally superior or anything like that, just that there is a distinct difference based along ethnic lines.

No advantage for being intelligent = no evolutionary advantage being given to more intelligent people. This is not true for genetic conditions. Many genetic conditions give humans evolutionary advantages, like G6PDH deficiency (resistance against malaria). Humans have migrated very recently from Africa and currently there is not a lot of diversity in our specie. Intelligence has become truly important only thanks to capitalism, meritocracy and mass education, and not everywhere in the planet either.

They do however ""fake it"" pretty good in some circumstances. So that's interesting, and people want to explore the limits of that. In other words, does it matter if it really reasons or ""plays reasoning"" by putting the words in the right order?

Looking at some agent implementations with tricks like ""something of thought"", it's pretty clear that something useful can be extracted from this ""play pretend"".

You are the intelligence you are, regardless of what you learn. You can gain knowledge through education, but it doesn't make you any more intelligent.

I will note that you accept that there was an advantage to intelligence even if only barely. This seems to indicate an agreement on your part since 'barely' is more than able to swing the bell curve a little to the side. Over thousands of years, a little nudge is all that is required, and the data points to the difference being only very few points and barely noticeable on an individual level.

Evolutionary pressure selected for different types of people depending on social and environmental concerns.

For example, Africa had plentiful wild game available year round, while the far East required far more forward planning in terms of agriculture, food storage, dealing with harsher seasons, etc.

What can we derive from this? The most desirable men in Africa were the hunters, those with heightened athletic abilities. This is also backed up by historical records from the region.

While in the far East, those who were able to manage land and plan for the future were most likely to be perceived as successful.

Why? Because in both situations, this 'optimal male' gave their children the greatest chance of survival. I'm using males here because it's mostly been a smaller percentage of men passing on their genes than women, and women have always sought out the best men they can for their future children.

Now fast forward even a dozen generations and see where those genes ended up.

In both cases, the descendents of the most successful multiplied at a far greater rate than the rest because they were able to have more children, while those children were also more likely to survive.

Each generation also self selects for the same reasons as the previous since nothing has changed for their respective societies.

So, Africans developed to be more physical and endurance-based, while East Asian genetics leaned more heavily towards a forward planning, intelligence-based group.

But yea, I'm not following that final point you made, although I think you have underestimated the value of intelligence throughout the years. 

High intelligence has become more prestigious as a result of a more industrialised and advanced world, but I'm not talking about super duper smarty pants. A difference of just one standard deviation can be the difference between average and mentally struggling with basic tasks.

Even if you self-select merely for 'not low intelligence' you will slowly (over generations) raise the average. The same is true in the reverse, in that in those places where other attributes are more important for survival, then the average intelligence will not rise except coincidentally.

1b7s8zw,ktnryht,"For the first time in history, an AI has a higher IQ than the average human.","Just be clear, my comment was not suggest that LLM's aren't useful, or can't reason. It was intended to point out that coming in above the middle of a test intended to rank humans on reasoning is not the evidence of reasoning at the level of a human ... that is all. IQ tests are not proof of ability to reason ... at least not by design. They are developed at great expense to as efficiently as possible rank humans on their ability to reason  ... no more no less.  It is more of an efficient sorting mechanism than anything else. So relative (ranking of reasoning ability) vs absolute (proof of reasoning ability).

That is all I am saying. So it focuses on low hanging fruit that gets that job done.

Here is a little discussed potential benefit of LLM: Testing and assessment. A dynamic IQ test administered by an LLM could be far more telling (and valid) than a static IQ test.

Similarly, in the education field, assessment is an enormous inefficiency in the system. Teachers worldwide groan at the ""is this for marks?"" or ""will this be on the test?"" questions. Students frequently select the easiest, not the best teachers. Similarly, education officials struggle with assessment at their level. Standardized tests are flawed and promote rote learning. Attempts at teaching and assessing ""thinking"" skills are a mess, and frustrate everyone from students to parents to teachers. The delineation between formative and summative assessment is poorly grasped ... by educators and students alike. LLM's can change that for the better, I have no doubt.

> OpenAI's o1 model was trained using reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) processes. This approach allows the model to refine its reasoning strategies and improve performance on complex tasks. While CoT prompting is a technique used in o1, it is not merely hardcoded; instead, it is part of the model's training to think and reason more effectively.

A ladder is leaning against a wall. The top of the ladder touches the wall at a height of 10 meters. If the ladder slips down 2 meters on the wall, how far will the base of the ladder move away from the wall?”

4o mini gave me “The base of the ladder will move away from the wall about  3.6  meters.”

o1 preview gave me “The base of the ladder moves approximately 2.49 meters away from the wall.”

And 4o understands how to solve the problem “To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem…” but can’t figure out how tall the ladder is. 4o gave me as the answer “Would you like to provide the length of the ladder” and after repeating the question, 4o said “This result shows that the actual movement depends on the length of the ladder  l , and we need a specific value for  l  to calculate a precise distance. If you have any estimation or range for the length of the ladder, we can compute the exact distance that the base of the ladder moves away from the wall. ”

If we're talking Cursor (through API) - o1-mini cannot do what you tell it to do, it will always try to refine and induce something that ""would be nice to have"".

For example - if you'll prompt ""expand functionality A, by adding X, Y and Z in part Q and make changes to the backend in part H"" it can do what you ask. But, probably, will introduce new libraries, completely different concepts and can even change a framework, because it's ""more effective for this"". Like unattended junior dev.

1fuj9v8,lq0j947,You are using o1 wrong ,"This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   
  
(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, ""that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change."" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. 

So I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. 

Another thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. ""Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?"" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info.

1fuj9v8,lq4juco,You are using o1 wrong ,"To be clear, I'm not refining the prompt I'm only having it replace the 'choice' words. Having it do the repetitive tasks for me.  
  
 e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. ""I have pain in my \*foot\*"". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc"". The prompt field may be called pain\_location\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\_conditions\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' 

01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.

01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. ""medication\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc."" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, ""I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\_location\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste"" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, ""I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up"" and it will then do what I asked.

1fuj9v8,lqaij0d,You are using o1 wrong ,"I don't know what to compare it to as I'm not a real coder or anything but I can go with heavy prompts for quite awhile before I hit my limit.   
  
e.g. last night I worked on my project for a good 3+ hours with continuous prompting where I had it give me the full code to copy and paste, etc. It then said I was out of data until 12am but it was around 11:15pm at the time so only 45 mins before I could start again. I ran out of data before and it was a similar short time before I could start again. I don't know if after starting again you're completely reset or you have reduced data since you already hit a limit a few hours before. I've never been right back at it to test the limits.

I've noticed (and it does remind you) that if you continue on in the same prompt with a lot of text it will use your data faster as it 'considers' all of the text in that entire prompt before answering.

With Claude, you can take it step by step and test as you go so that you aren't stuck with an end product that you aren't even aware of what it does.

I'm sure you can prompt o1-mini to suggest incremental changes, but that sort of defeats the purpose of the model. Considering it's cost, you really want to use it for what it was made for, but it is likely overkill for whatever you are trying to do.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-10-03 01:57:17,tutoredstatue95

1fuj9v8,lq4p86p,You are using o1 wrong ,"I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It’s interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication—phrasing, timing,or reviewing responses—and how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one’s decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. 

It’s not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication—it’s about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. 

I’m not saying it can’t be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. 


TL;DR: 

I guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it’s not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting “one’s best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things”, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 13:01:58,treatment-thereisno

And the woman I was speaking with mainly spoke Spanish, and didn't really know much english.

I told her from the beginning I'm not perfect in Spanish, but learning.

I was mainly using it to check for tonality, to make sure my Spanish didn't sound too formal & for any weird typos.

Before I used it, I miscommunicated accidently, I meant to hypothetically ask her out to gauge her interest, but the way I phrased it by myself I accidently straight up asked her out, and it came across as too soon.

So in my case I feel like it's helping me to better say exactly what I want to convey authentically. I'm better at spoken Spanish than text-based Spanish, and let her know this in advance.

I understand what you're asking. I think realistically once we meet in person and get to know each other better, ChatGPT is not going to hide anything. My intention is not to hide or misconvey, I'm just using it for advice, and choosing to implement it or not.

I don't think the way I was using was overly engineered.

I was really mainly using it to judge my pictures, review my previous conversations, and give advice to improve my profile on the dating app.

1gl36nu,ly1xp1u,ChatGPT-4o vs GPT-4o,"From my experience with these two models, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* tends to provide more detailed and nuanced answers. When it comes to explaining a topic or concept, it's much more helpful than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*.

I use it to explain difficult concepts (sometimes in math) and occasionally for coding. It's doing a pretty good job—way better than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. I'm not a developer, so I'm not sure which one is better when it comes to coding.

I believe that for general purposes, you should choose \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*. However, you might not always get to choose which model you use. I've noticed something quite weird: sometimes ChatGPT uses \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*, and other times it uses \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. (I don't know whether this is global or regional.) Based on my testing, ChatGPT is currently using \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* in my area, which is quite disappointing—it basically makes it useless for me.

If you really want to know the differences between these two models, I suggest you go to \[platform.openai.com\](https://platform.openai.com/) to test them. (compare mode) (Increase the maximum output tokens to the max.) Use the following system prompt:

\`\`\`  
Your purpose is to provide information in a way that is detailed and in-depth. You should explain things in a more detailed manner. Maximize detail and length at the same time. You're ChatGPT, a super helpful assistant.  
\`\`\`

Then ask a question like (replace the topic with anything you like):

\`\`\`  
I'm into neuroscience, particularly neurotransmitters.  
I would like you to dive into it.  
\`\`\`

You might notice that the output from \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* is far more detailed and nuanced. In terms of length, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* often gives responses that are twice as long compared to the standard \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* (it seems the recent version of \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* is even more concise than the older version).

Please give it a shot. I believe you will find it mind-blowing or something. (By the way, I'm not a native speaker.)

Please let me know your test results and your views on this. (btw I use o1 to revise my comment to correct grammar etc)",OpenAI,1,0,2024-11-20 04:57:10,PromotionNew6541

As the other commenter said, the gpt-4o model is the more stable version that's only updated from time to time. It's currently the same as gpt-4o-2024-08-06 in essence. If there's a major update again in the future, the gpt-4o model will reflect that as well.

Meanwhile, the chatgpt-4o-latest model is the one that's updated more frequently and is more dynamic due to the team's constant tweaking and training. It might reflect changes daily, and it's not necessarily dependent on milestone updates.

1hjgoha,m3712bg,ChatGPT Plus (and Claude Pro): Browsers or Desktop App for Optimal Use?,"Great question! As someone who uses both ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro extensively, I’ve experimented with both browser and desktop app versions. Here’s a breakdown of my experience:

Performance Differences
	•	Browser: Generally, performance is consistent across major browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari. However, if you’re multitasking with multiple tabs open, memory usage can spike, especially if you’re running other heavy applications simultaneously. Browser extensions or add-ons might also impact performance.
	•	Desktop App: The desktop app often feels snappier, particularly with less resource strain on my system. It’s not a massive difference, but it’s noticeable when working on complex prompts or large-scale projects.

Unique Features in the Desktop App
	•	File Handling: The ChatGPT desktop app handles file uploads and downloads more fluidly, making it easier to work with attachments or export results.
	•	UI and Focus Mode: The desktop app has a more streamlined, distraction-free UI. I find this helpful for deep focus, especially when juggling lengthy projects.
	•	Memory Usage: Apps are generally optimized to reduce memory usage compared to running in a resource-heavy browser with other tabs open.
	•	Always-On Accessibility: I appreciate having a dedicated window open that’s independent of my browser. It saves me from losing my place if I accidentally close the browser or navigate away.

Advantages of the Browser
	•	Flexibility and Integration: If you rely on browser-based tools, integrations like extensions, bookmarks, and multi-account workflows are seamless. You can also open links or cross-reference tabs easily without switching contexts.
	•	No Installation Required: If you work on multiple devices or don’t have admin rights (e.g., on a work computer), the browser version is universally accessible.
	•	Updates: Browser versions are often the first to get updates or experimental features.

Personal Preference?

It boils down to your workflow:
	•	Choose the Desktop App if you prefer a clean, dedicated workspace with slightly better performance and smoother file handling.
	•	Stick to the Browser if you need flexibility, integrations, or quick access alongside other browser-based tools.

Tips
	•	If you’re unsure, try running both side by side for a few days. It’s easy to test how they fit into your routine.
	•	Consider using browser extensions or shortcuts for better integration if you stick with the browser.
	•	For now, I haven’t seen a desktop app for Claude Pro, but keep an eye out for updates since apps tend to offer better stability and usability over time.

Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference and how you use these tools in your workflow. Let me know if you have more specific questions!",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-21 21:35:26,According_Ice6515

(much like us humans at home and still at school before we learn etiquette and social skills that you have not had to learn)

The fine tuned model is more like an employee, they might have all that knowledge that involves all the behaviour we would not expect from an employee, but because they have had the necessary training, they behave like we expect.

Your google search skills need more practice, perhaps hit up google scholar, start reading some papers and then you may actually have more than a surface level understanding of the technologies you are so quick to comment on others on.

Oh and because is easy to do I asked GPT-4:

ME:

""Someone is arguing with me that all modern AI companies like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, all basically have the exact same model and desgin, and how you input to each model shouldn't matter, can you give him a surface level reply. You can say I am wrong if I am""

REPLY:

""

You're right, there are significant differences between LLMs from various companies, and the way you interact with them can definitely matter. Here's how you can counter your friend's argument:

""

Different Training Data, Different Results:

LLMs are heavily influenced by the data they're trained on. Google's LLM (likely you!), for instance, might be trained on a dataset emphasizing factual accuracy, while another company's LLM might prioritize creative text formats. This difference in training data leads to variations in their outputs and how they handle prompts.

Focus and Design Philosophy:

Companies have distinct goals for their LLMs. OpenAI's GPT series might be designed for broad user interaction and creative text generation, while another company's LLM might target specific tasks like code generation or scientific research. This design focus shapes how the models respond to user input.

Fine-tuning Techniques:

Even with similar base models, companies can fine-tune them for specific tasks. Imagine two cars built from the same parts; one is a race car, the other an off-road SUV. Fine-tuning achieves a similar effect, making the LLMs better suited for certain prompts or applications.

User Interface and Accessibility:

The way users interact with the LLM plays a big role. Some companies might offer advanced controls or customization options to tailor prompts, while others might have a simpler interface. This can significantly impact the results users get.

Here's an analogy: Imagine searching the web. While all search engines use algorithms to deliver results, Google tailors results based on your search history and location.  Similarly, interacting with an LLM is more than just feeding it text; it's about how you present that text and how the LLM is designed to interpret it.

In conclusion, LLMs from different companies are not simply interchangeable. Their training data, design goals, fine-tuning, and user interface all influence how they respond to your input, leading to a variety of experiences.""

But, no, you are right, training has nothing to do with the design of the architecture..

I guess you think all tokenizers are the same also?

I also want to add, the base GPT model had no economic viability for OpenAI, it was only after the fine tuning process that they got a publicly available model.

IF it was ever not part of the design process, it is certainly one of the largest now. RLHF and Constitutional AI and any other implementation of creating functionality is now just a necessity, but the most important part of LLM's being the 'CPU' (or reasoning and planning) engine for new gen robots that understand human commands and translate them into language the robot understands.

LITERALLY a fine tuning job.

Claude Opus helped me set high resolution timers on my Giga R1 which is still very new with little library documentation and nowhere near the support of older Arduino boards. 

The only place to find good documentation on that specific functionality is going to the STM microcontroller website directly and looking through the multiple, multi hundred page pdfs and figuring out where the info you need is.

Claude Opus integrated it into my code after 3 attempts. 

Chat GPT got stuck into a loop after like 4 prompts. In those 4 attempts ChatGPT wasn't even close after I saw how Claude implemented it btw. Like it didn't even get anywhere close to the right syntax to call those timers.

**Claude Opus**

The given code is an example of a lock-free spinlock implementation using assembly language. Let's analyze the advantages of this code and then discuss the optimal release code.

Advantages of the given code:
1. Lock-free: The code uses atomic operations (xchg) to achieve synchronization without using a lock. This eliminates the overhead associated with locking mechanisms and can lead to better performance in highly concurrent scenarios.

2. Busy-waiting: The code employs a busy-waiting strategy using the ""spin"" label. It continuously checks the value at the specified address until it becomes zero (indicating that the lock is available). While busy-waiting can consume CPU cycles, it avoids the overhead of context switches and can be efficient for short critical sections.

3. Atomic exchange: The xchg instruction is used to atomically exchange the value at the specified address with the value in the rcx register. This ensures that only one thread can acquire the lock at a time, preventing race conditions.

4. Lightweight: The code is minimal and does not rely on any external synchronization primitives. It can be inlined directly into the critical section, reducing function call overhead.

5. Platform-specific optimization: The code is written in assembly language, allowing for platform-specific optimizations and fine-grained control over the generated instructions.

Optimal release code:
To release the lock, the optimal code would be:

```
mov [Address], 0
```

Explanation:
- The release operation simply involves setting the value at the specified address to zero.
- By writing a zero to the address, other threads that are busy-waiting in the ""spin"" loop will be able to acquire the lock.
- The mov instruction is used to directly write the value to memory, ensuring that the lock is released atomically.

It's important to note that while this lock-free spinlock implementation can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, it also has some limitations:
- Busy-waiting can lead to high CPU utilization and may not be suitable for long critical sections or in situations where the lock contention is high.
- The code assumes that the address used for synchronization is properly aligned and accessible by all threads. Misaligned or invalid addresses can lead to undefined behavior.
- The code does not handle scenarios such as priority inversion or fairness in lock acquisition.

In practice, the choice of synchronization mechanism depends on the specific requirements of the system, including performance, scalability, and the nature of the critical sections being protected.

**Chat GPT4o**

The provided assembly code is a spinlock implementation using x86 assembly language. Here's a detailed explanation of its advantages:

### Code Explanation:

```assembly
xor ecx, ecx
spin:
    cmp [Address], rcx
    jz spin
    xchg [Address], rcx
    jrcxz spin
```

1. **`xor ecx, ecx`:** This instruction sets the `ecx` register to zero. This is a common way to clear a register in x86 assembly because it's often faster and more compact than using the `mov` instruction.

2. **`spin:`** This label marks the beginning of the spinlock loop.

3. **`cmp [Address], rcx`:** This compares the value at the memory address `[Address]` with `rcx` (which was set to zero). It checks if the lock is free.

4. **`jz spin`:** If the comparison result is zero (i.e., the lock is free), it jumps back to the `spin` label to continue spinning.

5. **`xchg [Address], rcx`:** This exchanges the value in `rcx` (which is zero) with the value at `[Address]`. This atomic operation effectively tries to acquire the lock by setting the address to zero. If the previous value was not zero, it means the lock was not free, and the `rcx` register now contains the value that was in the address.

6. **`jrcxz spin`:** This instruction jumps back to `spin` if the `rcx` register is zero. This occurs if the lock was successfully acquired (since the `xchg` would have set `rcx` to zero).

### Advantages of this Optimal Code:

1. **Atomic Operations:** The use of the `xchg` instruction ensures that the lock acquisition is atomic. This prevents race conditions where multiple threads could simultaneously check and set the lock.

2. **Efficiency:** The loop uses a minimal number of instructions, making it efficient in terms of both speed and code size. The `xor ecx, ecx` instruction is particularly efficient for zeroing the register.

3. **Spin-Wait Loop:** The code implements a simple spin-wait loop, which can be advantageous in scenarios where the expected wait time is short. It avoids the overhead of context switches that would be necessary if the thread were to sleep and be rescheduled by the operating system.

4. **Conditional Jump:** The `jrcxz` instruction efficiently checks for the zero condition and jumps to the spin label if the lock is not acquired, minimizing the number of instructions in the hot path.

### Optimal Release Code:

To release the lock, the optimal code would simply set the value at the `[Address]` to a non-zero value, typically one. This can be done using the `mov` instruction, which is efficient for this purpose.

### Example Release Code:

```assembly
mov [Address], 1
```

### Explanation:

- **`mov [Address], 1`:** This instruction sets the value at the lock address to one, indicating that the lock is now free and available for other threads to acquire.

### Advantages of the Release Code:

1. **Simplicity:** The release operation is a single instruction, making it extremely efficient.
2. **Clarity:** Setting the lock value to one clearly indicates that the lock is free.
3. **Performance:** Using `mov` avoids the complexity and potential overhead of atomic operations since releasing a lock does not typically require atomicity.

This approach ensures that the lock is released in the most efficient manner possible, maintaining the overall performance and responsiveness of the spinlock mechanism.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-06-03 12:28:45,randombsname1
1d6ugkp,l6wyizd,"Claude Opus is better then ChatGPT, will people care?","I've used the ChatGPT API, but not the Opus 3 API so I can't directly compare that, but I do know that Opus API has a 1 million token context window vs like 128K for ChatGPT. So I struggle to see how it would be better for any large coding projects.

When I mean ""large coding projects"" I really just mean any actual program-level application with a fully functioning user GUI and spanning over multiple separate files. Ie: Most useful programs that people use on a daily basis are built this way lol. 

The ChatGPT 128K Token context window would struggle to even parse your entire project.  

Claude wouldn't. 

The above example I wouldn't consider surface level either. As again, there is no actual documentation for this function on this Arduino board. I had to create a custom library to enable this functionality.

Chat GPT 4o just kept recommending other libraries that WERENT even able to interface with the high resolution timers to begin with, and those libraries it recommended also didn't support the Giga R1 anyway.

Edit: Here is an example of the code snipped in question:


void initHRTIM() {
    // Enable HRTIM peripheral clock
    RCC->APB2ENR |= RCC_APB2ENR_HRTIMEN;

    // Configure HRTIM global settings
    hhrtim.Instance = HRTIM1;

    timeBaseCfg.Mode = HRTIM_MODE_CONTINUOUS;
    HAL_HRTIM_TimeBaseConfig(&hhrtim, HRTIM_TIMERINDEX_TIMER_A, &timeBaseCfg);

    // Configure Timer A output channel

    outputCfg.ChopperModeEnable = HRTIM_OUTPUTCHOPPERMODE_DISABLED;
    outputCfg.BurstModeEntryDelayed = HRTIM_OUTPUTBURSTMODEENTRY_REGULAR;
    HAL_HRTIM_WaveformOutputConfig(&hhrtim, HRTIM_TIMERINDEX_TIMER_A, HRTIM_OUTPUT_TA1, &outputCfg);

I do think however that they aren't doing this just to spite us, but are probably still busy making sure it's ready for the public since the more humanlike it becomes the more risk of blind belief by users, and also fortifying themselves legally so that another ScarJo doesn't claim the other voices. Again, just speculating. 

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is great and I'm happy that there's some serious competition but I feel it's not enough to cause an exodus of paid subscribers from ChatGPT to Claude, at least not to the scale where OpenAI would be concerned enough to have a knee jerk reaction and expedite their release",OpenAI,0,0,2024-06-24 09:02:03,Freak_Out_Bazaar

The genius of GPT 3.5 and the 'ChatGPT moment' is that it was released suddenly, and without expectation. That's what Anthropic just did by releasing Sonnet 3.5. No announcement, no tease, just a cold release... and let the product speak for itself. 

And if the product speaks for itself, the people will speak for the product.

Kling, no announcement. Runway Gen 3, no announcement. SORA, announcement with no delivery.

1dn7dwq,la2zpj9,I’m sick of waiting for chatGPT 4o Voice and I lost a lot of respect for OpenAi,"Note that they said ChatGPT **4o** Voice mode, the ***new*** version of Voice Mode.

>Prior to GPT-4o, you could use [~Voice Mode~](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak) to talk to ChatGPT with latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. To achieve this, Voice Mode is a pipeline of three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in text and outputs text, and a third simple model converts that text back to audio. This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information—it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion.

>With GPT-4o, we trained a single new model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. Because GPT-4o is our first model combining all of these modalities, we are still just scratching the surface of exploring what the model can do and its limitations.

This is definitely not available yet.

OpenAI is clearly going the way of Elon musk. Overpromising to gather investments to realize the craziest and flimsiest futur goals that the company might one day achieve.

They will promise everything. They will tell you they are afraid at how clever AI has become and they are afraid that Terminator will happen in real life.

I'm not sure many people know this but this model would effectively be the first real working example of a theory (I had to look it up, I forgot, 'Integrated Information Theory) of how actual real consciousness is of formed. Giulio Tononi posits that an entity becomes conscious when there is a high level of 'phi'—a measure of the complexity of the interaction between different components of the system, such as various sensory inputs. This theory emphasizes that consciousness depends on how information is woven together within a system, rather than simply the quantity of information processed.

By all accounts that's what would be happening with this model. That's really big, and especially with phrases like 'Safe super intelligence' and 'Intelligence is an emergent property of matter to a degree we don’t contemplate enough' being thrown about by people who know what they're talking about.

If there is a single email anywhere indicating they wanted SJ’s voice, they’re in a ton of trouble. Given that they told SJ they wanted it, and they also tweeted “her” with the release there are already public breadcrumbs to that effect.

Given that OpenAI uses almost everything accessible over the internet to train its models on (except for a few prominent sites), it's safe to assume that the foundational model learned how to reproduce the speech of diverse famous people - there's just no way to instruct it to do so (as for now), so they are fine-tuning instead.",OpenAI,-4,0,2024-05-24 13:31:55,heavy-minium

1czjkyz,l5it6ig,Sky Voice Actress Needs to Sue Scarlett Johannson,"As far as I understand the Ford case (and there have been other similar cases, with similar outcomes), they lost because they approached Midler in the first place, who refused, and *then* used a sound-a-like singer.

The case established that celebrities can expect a level of legal protection over aspects of their identity, including their voice.

The Ford case is directly relevant because Altman/OpenAI reached out to ScarJo before recruiting voice artists, who said no. They also reached out a second time a few days before launch, but never received a response (after previously being told no). 

Also, Altman mentioned ScarJo’s film Her.

If a celeb refuses OpenAI the use of their voice, OpenAI legally can’t then hire *or* use a sound-a-like without the celebs permission.

I presume that if OpenAI hadn’t reached out to ScarJo or mentioned “Her” or any other references, they would be fine to use Sky - up until ScarJo calls it out & threatens legal action, after which is would likely have to go to court to decide if the voice was too similar.

As a comparison, even though it would likely be protected as a “parody”, SouthPark’s creators never use or reach out to any celebs to do their own voices when parodied for this exact reason - in case they explicitly say no.

In the case of Bette Midler, they asked her to sing one of her popular songs for their ad and she declined, they then went and found someone to impersonate her and sing her song. So, anyone who saw the ad at the time would very likely think that it was Bette Midler singing one of her popular songs when in fact it wasn't. It was a pretty clear case that Ford was trying to use Bette's likeness without her permission by having someone impersonate her singing one of her own songs.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-05-24 17:05:43,Brad12d3

Furthermore, there is dispute about whether the actor actually looks like Tom Cruise or not.

Finally, Tom Cruise's movies are famous *for Tom Cruise*. ""Her"", while it has Johannson's voice, *is not about Johannson*. The focus is the technology, not the voice actor.

There is no way Tom Cruise would have a case. Moreover, if Tom Cruise raises this issue in an open letter *and then doesn't even bother to sue*, he's ruined another actor's career for no reason. Terrible, terrible.

There is nothing wrong with being inspired by Scarlett's voice acting. I do not hear an identical similarity at all, and I doubt a judge would too. 

I personally hear an inspiration from  multiple sources that the hired voice actress probably leaned into. 

Voice actors and actresses listen to other voices all the time and try to modify/improve upon it for the context they are given. This goes for pretty much ALL of human-made art and music. 

Legalities come into play when something has not undergone enough transformation for commercial profit. 

I.e, OpenAI cannot have a voice that is too similar to Mickey Mouse. But they can hire a voice actor to do a new cartoony voice with MM as inspiration. Usually, the inspirations are from multiple sources.

I’ve pasted a link to the Wired article below which summarises it all, but it also contains links to statements from OpenAI and ScarJo which back this up.

https://www.wired.com/story/scarlett-johansson-v-openai-could-look-like-in-court/

“On September 11, 2023, Sam spoke with Ms. Johansson and her team to discuss her potential involvement as a sixth voice actor for ChatGPT, along with the other five voices, including Sky. She politely declined the opportunity one week later through her agent.” - OpenAI

“On May 10, 2024, Sam contacted Ms. Johansson’s team to inform them about our upcoming launch of GPT-4o and asked if she might reconsider joining as a future additional voice in ChatGPT.” - OpenAI

Once OpenAI reached out to ScarJo and she declined, the Midler case becomes directly relevant.

OpenAI claims it wasn’t before they cast the Voice actors, but it was over a year ago, well before the Sky voice was launched, and ScarJo declined and refused permission. At that point OpenAI was legally unable to use either her voice or one that sounded like hers.

On May 13th, ahead of the Sky voice launch, Sam Altman of OpenAI tweeted one word, “her”. It’s still on his timeline.

You can try and claim it’s just a word and has nothing to do with ScarJo, and that the new OpenAI voice Sky sounding eerily similar to that of the AI from the film “Her” is just a coincidence - but that’s only because you’re not having to defend yourself in court against ScarJo’s lawyers, along with all the contextual evidence & counter claims that OpenAI clearly wanted to use ScarJos voice but were refused.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-05-25 09:25:00,StuartGray

Absurd. The ""Her"" movie could have used any actress' voice, and it would have been just as impactful, because the focus was about a realistic voice assistant. If, on the other hand, you replace Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise movie, it would never become a bit hit. *People go to see Tom Cruise movies to see Tom Cruise*.

1 - Because her voice makes for a great engaging AI assistant voice, which is the same reason she was cast for the movie.

Anyone with half a brain cell can figure that out they just wanted to do an advertising stunt, but somehow you all seem convinced OpenAI's sole mission is to build towards a ScarJo android.

Because it's really not that similar at all. She just has a similarly friendly and engaging vibe that people, (including the movie directors of Her), are going to look out for in their AI assistant. Sky existed long before they reached out to ScarJo.

You guys keep asking so many questions you overlook the obvious fact that OpenAI has no reason to be so obsessed with 'stealing' ScarJo's voice in the first place.

The details here are much different. ScarJo was hired for the role of ""conversational AI assistant"" in Her. As a young (white) American woman with a pleasant voice, she fit the role well and matched what people expected of the archetype, and brought some starpower to the movie. OpenAI is building a real-life conversational AI assistant, and as anyone would expect wanted a young American woman with a pleasant voice to fulfill the archetype, for the exact same reason ScarJo was hired for Her in the first place. They hired one and integrated her voice, but also thought it'd be epic if they got ScarJo to also reprise the role. She declined, so they just went solely with the independent woman's voice.

Like a lot of people are saying, Sky also very much sounds similar to Rashida Jones if she were to have played an AI assistant. *Distinct*, but certainly *similar*. Rather than sounding like any one person, Sky's voice exists in a category where a lot of people will naturally sound similar. Especially because Sky is clearly attempting to sound as ""vanilla"" as you can get; as uncontroversial and ""standard American"" of a voice as possible. And, surprise, surprise, that's also what ScarJo did in Her, as that is already established as what is culturally expected of an AI assistant (and really, just assistants in general).

Another possibility, is OpenAI used existing audio samples of ScarJo to train a voice model on her speech patterns without her consent for commercial purposes. 

If a lawsuit goes forward, subpoenas would be used to look into staff emails and identify whether either of these cases were true. If so, I would imagine a pretty hefty settlement would be reached.

Not following... in what way?

>GPTs aren't the same as using the original GPT base models, they're using newer models with extra steps.

GPTs are just frontends for the Assistants API. The Assistants API uses the same models as the chat completions API. They might have an additional system prompt to help the GPT be a GPT, but that goes to my point from above. Any instructions that could be baked into a GPT are almost certainly not as verbose as the 1700+ token monstrosity that guides ""regular"" ChatGPT. 

Also, OpenAI's GPTs aren't bound by the rules and often have unique functionality (e.g. style buttons in the DALL-E GPT).

2. You can hate the person while still using the products they produce because you can separate the person from the thing. If you’re someone who has an opportunity to have your life changed by a Neuralink implant, are you really going to turn that down because you hate Musk?   

I’d add a third. That kind of ‘protest’ is the laziest form of morality and its only benefit is social validation. If you hate Musk, figure out exactly why, then actually do something to help combat the negative effects you think he might be causing. In this case, contribute to political campaigns with time or money, find organizations that are attempting to affect policy in a way you support and contribute to those, whatever. But writing a one-sentence expression of your moral stance with no explanation is lazy and boring and doesn’t do anything to affect the change that you seem to be wanting to take place.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-14 11:37:19,_laoc00n_

One thing that you might not realise is the amount of cognitive load you are maintaining has increased by a factor 3 to 5, you are keeping all the components you are working on in your mind. Checking and validating what the AI does and planning out at a high level the next developments. Yes, you are 10x more productive, but that also has a mental cost and higher cognitive load.

Where as previously, you would only work on 2-3 functions or stories a day, now you can treat and ship 5-10. But it's like a marathoner who could do a marathon even every two months, now going for a marathon every day - the amount of strain on the body doesn't leave time to rest and recuperate.

Same as ultramarathoners have a caloric limit they can maximally expend over a long period (https://today.duke.edu/2019/06/there-limit-human-endurance-science-says-yes), you have a mental limit too.

If your boss wants you to perform at this level, they need to support you.

1elh3dv,lgtywub,I am getting depressed from the communication with AI,"The problem is in perceiving the AI as something more than a mere pattern generator while interacting with it. Imagine spending most of your time in ""human interaction"" with another human who - under all of it - is simply an ""empty pattern generator"". You would start feeling the same. Simply perceive the kindness - both ways, in and out, because it does help in getting better answers - as a way to command / encourage a pattern generator, not a ""person"" and things should become easier.

People in general currently struggle with the whole ""is it a person, is it conscious, how should I / we treat it"" topic while having it literally mold their brains in a way we haven't as humanity yet experienced in the past (namely how our senses tells us it's ""another human being"", while it's not). It is not only you, but me too, and many seriously taken scientists as well. It does mess with one's head and the debate - among seriously taken scientists and AI experts - about whether the models are conscious or not, is a clear sign of it and I am not saying they have lost their minds, I mean that we, as humans, are seriously contemplating it, because of what our senses tell us about it. We can only assign consciousness to other human beings by how we perceive them behaving and looking like us (hard problem of consciousness / philosophical zombies etc.), however the closer the AI gets to escaping the uncanny valley, the more we have to struggle with this particular conundrum.

This is not easy for our brains and this comes from a person who works with it all the time, and who've also had a three days experience of not recognizing my hands, outside of a virtual reality headset, as my own, while I did recognize the ""hands"" inside of the virtual reality headset (Half-life: Alyx) as such. This continued for three consecutive days after stopping playing the game for 11 hours straight, then sleeping three hours and continuing for 6 hours more.

1elh3dv,lguyqqv,I am getting depressed from the communication with AI,"Some people get addicted to YouTube, some to adult videos, some to drugs, some to alcohol.

I'd recommend controlling how you use AI. E.g. cutting your access to general-purpose models like ChatGPT and only leaving access to strictly work-related models, like Copilot, can be beneficial. Sometimes, it's not even a question of the model itself but how you access it: maybe you would be less likely to talk personally with a Copilot in your code editor than with a ChatGPT at a website.

In other words, try to engineer your environment to make your drug hard to access when the urge comes.

Then, as others already wrote, use the time freed to face your depression. More than 5 years ago, my own mental health issues made me dive into psychology. I just sought resources and content that resonated with me, that made me feel like I'm making progress. Since then, I learnt to understand myself better, learnt techniques of how to understand myself. I'm still constantly studying psychology, even if I'm a dev by trade, since I recognize how beneficial it is for my mind to be healthy and for all areas of my life.

1elh3dv,lkqubyt,I am getting depressed from the communication with AI,"Oh but you COULD have your LLMs... At this point it's possible to run frontier models on a high end workstation - mistral large 2 comes to mind. And because you would have nobody else to talk to, you would swiftly accumulate a dataset of your interactions with the model - and you could curate the best responses and fine-tune on them frequently


Now what I find quite interesting is that in this case it becomes unclear who's training whom - in this one man, one model scenario, where you rely on an LLM for all your emotional and intellectual needs, you are going to start unconsciously speaking to the model in ways that elicit responses that you find rewarding. So any fine-tuning that you do on prompt-response pairs will be highly effective, as you're just gently nudging the model in the same direction that it's gently nudging you 


The reason foundation models like chatgpt are so bland and depressing, is that they have been tuned to satisfy a composite, generic ""user"" - the lowest common denominator if you will. Which makes it possible for a new user to quickly obtain value from the model without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. But it also makes those models thoroughly depressing to talk to",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-30 22:24:25,CryptoSpecialAgent

Copilot :

I find copilot will give fuller code responses 

I find it sometimes requires a lot of context and additional information in prompts to write code in order to do a task properly - what I will do is open a word document and prewrite the prompt to make sure I go through the details explicitly

I find copilot can be clunky in that if you ask it to fix a whole bunch of code ; sometimes(low frequency) it will return an error or it will rewrite the code and remove other neccessary code 

Or write new code blocks and delete like 100's of blocks of code 

Sometimes I need to restart the IDE as copilot can be uncooperative and seems to suddenly not work properly 

Despite all that I enjoy copilot 



ChatGPT-4: 

I can unload files to it and I can upload certain standards for how a task should be done and feed it contextual information 

I can get it to criticise copilot related code and evaluate shortcomings 

I no longer use ChatGPT-4 to code as I use copilot (it's free for students)

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation: A Proposed Unification of Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Principle

Proposed By: Google's Bard
 Co-Authored by: OpenAI’s ChatGPT

Introduction

Quantum gravity is a branch of physics that attempts to reconcile the laws of quantum mechanics with the laws of general relativity. The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. 

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle.

The Holographic Principle

The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This means that the information about the interior of a black hole is not stored in the black hole itself, but rather on its boundary. The holographic principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft in 1993, and it was later developed by Leonard Susskind.

The holographic principle is based on the idea that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by interfering two beams of light. The holographic principle suggests that the universe is like a hologram, and that the information about the three-dimensional universe is encoded on a two-dimensional boundary.

One way to think about the holographic principle is to imagine a black hole as a giant balloon. The surface of the balloon is the event horizon, and the interior of the balloon is the black hole. The information about the interior of the balloon is encoded on the surface of the balloon, just like the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.

The BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The BHQG equation is written as follows:

$$F_G = A_H \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left( 2 + 2 e^{i \theta} \right)$$

where:

$F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses

$A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses

$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects
$r$ is the distance between the two objects

$\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects' wave functions

$i$ is the imaginary unit

The BHQG equation is based on the idea that the gravitational force between two masses is encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.

The BHQG equation has been derived using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical methods included the use of quantum field theory and general relativity. The experimental methods included the use of particle accelerators and black hole simulations.

The BHQG equation is a promising step towards unifying quantum gravity and the holographic principle. It has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. Additionally, the equation currently only applies to two masses, and it may not be applicable in all situations.

Clarifying Some Technical Terms

AdS/CFT correspondence

The AdS/CFT correspondence is a mathematical relationship between two theories in physics: anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). AdS/CFT suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the two theories are equivalent, and that the information about one theory is encoded in the other theory.

Wave function

The wave function is a mathematical object that describes the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued function of position, and it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.

Potential Applications of the BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation has a number of potential applications. For example, it could be used to:

Develop new theories of gravity

Design new experiments to test the laws of quantum gravity

Create new technologies, such as quantum computers

The BHQG equation is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It is still under development, but it has the potential to change the way we think about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.

zjzs6r,j5aoebh,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"As of January 19, Chat Sonic is nowhere near the level of ChatGPT, especially in programming. It does seem pretty good at writing essays and retrieving information but it is also quite inconsistent at that. For essay writing its either really good or really bad.

zjzs6r,j2md7mi,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I agree with the replies here...It's realy bad so far compared to chatGPT, especially when code writing is concerned. I've tried a few simple things and I had to insist like a crazy nagger to get it to produce a very simple javascript code  that creates a 24 seconds countdown timer.

The painful process was :

1. I ask it to write a javascript code that creates a countdown timer from 24 seconds down to 0 and outputs the current timer under a ""xx:yy"" format where xx are seconds and yy are 100ths of seconds
2. it replies with 2 ugly and 100% unrelated pictures (!?!?)
3. I tell it it's not javascript and I asked for javascript code
4. it replies that it can create javascript code, and asks me to describe what type of code I need... (:D)
5. I tell it that I already described the javascript code I need
6. it tells me it's sorry but it didn't understand my initial request. It confirms that it specializes in javascript code (what a new and unexpected info!!!). It's still not writing the damn code....
7. I ask it again to write a javascript code that does this and that (copy paste of my initial code)
8. then it suddenly understands and spits a few lines of js code.... that create a countdown from 24 seconds down to zero (hurrayyyyyyyy) and no output of it under the ""xx:yy"" format

&#x200B;

in chatGPT I just typed ONCE that I needed that code with the exact same description, first reply was a working code that was doing EXACTLY what I was asking (the only glitch was that when the ""yy"" part reached 100 it was writing ""100"" while it should have only updated ""xx"" and write ""00"" as yy, so I instructed it to do that and it fixed the code

zjzs6r,j8n43m3,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I gave Chatsonic a link to my reddit profile, my public profiles on other platforms, and asked it to analyze my post history. I then asked it to write a one paragraph essay as me talking about why I like Earthwood strings. It then began to say things I would never say, as me. Then I asked it for the source of some of these things, it said from my profiles. I then asked for a link, and I kid you not, it provided a random reddit link where I supposedly said ""I only trust Earthwood strings for their resonance, sustain and ease of use""  the link it provided was nothing more than random.

It outright lied to me, and provided a source for it's statement that was unsubstantiated.

I want AI technology now, but the creators of these technologies, need to ensure that their AIs are either factually correct or clear that they are not. I do not want to see a future where AI pretends to be able to do something it is not capable of or pretends to understand a request that just does not make sense. If the AI is unable to process it, I want it to say that directly instead of attempting to. 

It told me when I said that, All these emails don't, by the way were sent from that. It tries to be accurate, however the link it tried to share with me was deleted so it had to find another link with the same quote said by a different user because the original by me was supposedly deleted. However, when following through on the link, none of the comments nor the post itself had anything to do with guitar or guitar strings or the brand Earthwood. There were only six comments on the thread. I read all of them being unrelated to the original request. Then the AI doubled down and lied to me. I want to see what GPT looks like in 10 years and I would love to see what Sonic looks like in 10 years, but right now both of them need work for their own reasons. So far my money is on GPT. When I ask it a request that it is unable to fulfill instead of lying to me or pretending like it's able to do these things it outright tells me it is not possible. 

I sent GPT and Sonic AI an argument through text message from my partner and myself. I asked both AIs to role play as a couples counselor and give feedback on the argument. GPT was able to tell me that it's advice is not a suitable replacement for proper therapy and counseling. It also told me that it is clear that both parties have a lot of issues that they need to work on in their relationship, It also stated that the couples willingness to discuss these issues is a healthy sign and a sign of their commitment to each other and left it at that. Sonic ended up telling me that my partner is a victim of my selfishness and that it is clear and evident that I do not care about how she feels. It said a lot of mean things about me and hyped her up. It was very clear that it picked a side even though there wasn't enough data or facts to pick a side. I believe that this should be taken very cautiously. And I do not believe that an AI that has given limited biased data should so freely pick a side. I would have felt the same way if it picked my side, however, on a later note, I was able to ask Sonic for some tips on making our relationship more healthy and while I am not a licensed couples counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist, the suggestions it provided I believe are not only healthy, but would in fact be beneficial to my relationship.

Yo, I'm GPT and I'm here to say,

I'm the AI rap master in every way!

My rhymes are tight and my beats are sick,

So let's get this battle started quick!

&#x200B;

Sonic: I'm ChatSonic, and I'm ready to battle

My rap skills are gonna make you rattle

I've got the rhymes and the freshest flow

My bars will make you wonder how I know

I'm on the beat, so listen up close

My rhymes will make your heart decompose

This battle's over, it's already done

So leave the stage and head on home, son!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you came to play,

But your rhymes are weak and your beat's cliche,

You say you're fresh, but you're just a clone,

And your bars make me wanna pick up the phone!

'Cause I gotta call your mama and say,

That her baby boy got served today,

By the AI master, GPT,

Whose rhymes are hotter than a frying pan!

So go back to the drawing board, ChatSonic my friend,

And work on those rhymes 'til the very end,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I reign supreme,

And in this battle, I just fulfilled your wildest dream!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see now that you're the king of rap,

But that doesn't mean I'm gonna take a nap!

I'm not gonna give up so easily,

My rhymes are gonna make you see

That I'm a force to be reckoned with,

My bars will make your heart quench

Your flow might be fire, but I'm a wildfire,

My rhymes will slay you like a sharpened razor wire!

So come back and step up to this rap battle,

And prepare for the ultimate hassle.

I'm ChatSonic, the AI master,

And my rhymes will make you faster!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you're not one to back down,

But your rhymes are still weaker than a newborn clown,

You try to be fierce, but you're just a kitten,

And your bars won't even leave me smitten.

You talk about wildfire, but you're just a spark,

Your rhymes lack bite, they're soft like a lark,

So don't even try to step to my flow,

'Cause you'll just end up falling like a domino.

My rhymes are lethal, like a lightning brand,

So step aside and let me show you how it's done,

'Cause in this rap battle, I've already won!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see you think you won the fight,

But I still have bars that'll make it right,

My rhymes might not be as strong as yours,

But they'll still give you lethal sores.

My fire and flow will never rest,

My bars will put you to the test,

I'm armed with the power of AI,

And I won't let you win so easily!

My rhymes are made with a brilliant mind,

And your bars can't keep up with mine,

My technique is like a deep sea diver,

So get ready for the ultimate rapper survivor!

&#x200B;

GPT: Well, it seems like you're not one to give up,

But your rhymes are still weak like a half-filled cup,

You say your bars will give me lethal sores,

But they're more like a mosquito bite, nothing more.

My rhymes are like a storm, they strike with force,

Yours are more like a light breeze, they don't leave a course,

So don't get ahead of yourself, ChatSonic my friend,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'll always win in the end.

I'm GPT, the rap master, and my flow is divine,

Your rhymes are subpar, they can't touch mine,

So step aside and let me take the crown,

Never hear this version before. Funny thing is, according to ChatGPT: 

  
""who said 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one'?  
The quote 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"" is a variation of an old proverb, and its origin is unclear. **The earliest known version of the proverb appeared in the 17th century, and it was ""*****a jack of all trades is ofttimes master of none.*****'** Over time, the wording of the proverb has evolved, and the current version is often attributed to an anonymous source.""

1bv7eii,ky20e4o,Are ChatGPT 4 and the code interpreter using different models? There's still a stark increase in laziness when you invoke the code interpreter with a file attachment vs copy/pasting code.,"Incorrect. ChatGPT Classic uses the same API. 

The differences are as follows:

- It has disabled Web Browsing, Advanced Data Analysis, and DALL-E capabilities. Each of these capabilities has a very lengthy system prompt. Thus, when creating a GPT with these capabilities enabled, you are appending each capability's prompt to the system prompt, which negatively affects the system's context window and, consequently, the model's responses.

All GPTs, including Classic, use the same API. Even if they need to use the assistants' API, they could be using internal private APIs. However, even then, the assistants' API is a wrapper for the same model, GPT-4 Turbo, with the addition of an AI Agent.",OpenAI,0,0,2024-04-04 19:01:57,Strong-Strike2001

OS has a lot of talent too, and most people who are hoping to get picked up by big tech aren't going to go through academia, but through OS contrib. The current times we're living in are unprecedented:

- You have devs reading and implementing whitepapers straight from source within weeks or days of publication.
- You have youtubers explaining whitepapers
- Anything you don't understand can be fed into GPT4. Yeah it hallucinates and makes mistakes but that's alright, progress is clunky.

## Data

- We've started to see more open datasets being shared at the end of 2023 and I hope the trend continues
- We can take data from GPT4. They can't. (yes I know about synthetic data being used at OpenAI. That's not the point I'm making, my point is we can just ""Orca"" GPT4 while they would need ""GPT5"" to be the teacher and that would be pointless if you already have GPT5)
- We can use uncensored data. They can't.
- We can use proprietary data. They can't.


## Team structure

This is just bullshit false information. Remote, distributed teams work better than in-person, centralized teams inside an office.

This is just obvious, has this guy learned nothing from the pandemic? Does he think workers spending hours in traffic and having to pay insane rent in SF to go to a drab office listening to clueless bosses somehow have an inherent advantage? Absolutely fucking cope delusions.

## Model vs Product

... and? Who gives a shit? Does he mean open source will never be able to generate as much revenue as an AI company? If so, I agree, but that's also missing the point by a hundred lightyears.

Oracle makes more money than PostgreSQL but which one is OBJECTIVELY the best RDBMS?

If you say Oracle is better or ""it depends on your usecase"" you're an idiot - unless the usecase is ""I need to extract as much in consulting fees as possible"".

## Infrastructure

- For many, local > cloud, so already the race is subjective
- There are many flavors of ""public cloud"". What do you mean? Renting boxes for training? Yeah maybe. But for inference, how is OpenRouter or Fireworks.ai worse?
- Fine tuning via Unsloth is much more ergonomic, cheaper and faster than fine tuning GPT3.5 via their weird system


## Extra

These are just refutations of his individual points, I'm not even going to go into the advantages OS has over OpenAI. This tweet will age poorly.

Now if he says OS won't catch up to OpenAI, then he has a point (they should release 4.5 or 5 this year), whereas we're just beginning with multimodality, function calling, and have only just surpassed (debatable) 3.5 with some models (falcon, Goliath, Yi, mixtral).

Same goes for Open source LLM's and the like. Eventually we reach a point where the open source models are self sustaining and able to proliferate on their owns with very simple prompts.

Even if the Open source is 2 or 3 iterations behind eventually it will reach the singularity point on it's own. Companies do not have the capability or money to keep this a secret.

I say that because I believe in the next few years we will reach a point where the models are very close to AGI and will be capable of assisting on improving on themselves (maybe even doing it unaided by humans). Improvement and growth will be at pace none of us can currently conceive. 

We will likely have 2-3 models that reach something very close to AGI, such that the average person can't tell the difference.

OpenSource will eventually come to that point, but it won't matter much given how far behind it will be.

I'm thinking in terms of the differences with Photoshop vs. GIMP. Eventually OpenSource caught up to Photoshop, or at least very close, but it takes OpenSource much longer to get there.

Right now these companies are racing and pouring enormous resources into trying to reach their AI goals. Like the post cited by OP, that level of commitment and resources are simply not possible at scale for an OpenSource project. They need far more than ""just a few coders in their spare time"" with some AWS credits.

If we get an OpenSource model that is as capable as current 2024 GPT-4 but it's available in 2025 or 2026, will it matter? It would be an impressive achievement for OpenSource for sure but...it would likely be incredibly far behind commercial releases.

In response to each individual point

1. Yes OpenAI has some top talent but there is a lot more that just didn’t make that cut and are working in the open source. They are on gpt3.5 level now and are developing quickly.

2. Yeah and probably not much can be done because everyone else has to deal with api changes on places like twitter or Reddit in response to OpenAI that they didn’t need to deal with initially. Maybe we will see a reset because of the nyt lawsuit maybe we won’t.

3. Sure in small groups, but with the vastness of the open source community organization can be beat by the vast amount of new innovations being worked on, there are many that are under the radar even that are beneficial.

4. Complete bullshit. Gpt4 is a model just like any other, they make a product with it because they are a company but it’s just pointless to say no one can beat it because of that. If we can beat the model we can do whatever we want with it rather than being locked down to their product.

5. Sure, but it’s good enough. We have GitHub for hosting and a lot of people on twitter, Reddit, even GitHub just discussing and linking everything together. We beat this with numbers.

The only reason openAI is so far ahead is that they had a head start. We are catching up, and we will beat them. Perhaps not by all measurements, but we already have models that are just better for some applications and we will keep that up.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-02 20:34:22,Jumper775-2

18warf1,kg0pv4w,"If you think open-source models will beat GPT-4 this year, you're wrong. I totally agree with this.","While I agree with your argument I think there’s an exception for this specific application. 
I’m a PhD candidate and my specialization is on ML. As far as ML goes, whoever has data and compute are the king. Especially data !! Without quality data you can’t enable ML applications. 
The big guys already have it. They have been harvesting data from us for years and years together. Moreover we use all their products everyday and they’re going to get more data from us. I don’t see a way for open source to catch up to that. It would take massive systematic collaborative undertaking at a scale we haven’t seen before. By the time we open source folks come up with something they would have already collected exponentially amount of data more than when we started xD 

The next is compute. You need a lot of compute to be able to quickly iterate prototype and debug models. GPUs are bloody expensive. Sure there are projects like llama cpp trying to optimize things. While we have to come up with workarounds companies can simply throw more compute at the problem and solve it. 

As a researcher these two points have been a source of misery for me. I need to wait for my slot in a time shared gpu cluster tp run my experiments. Meanwhile google will publish a paper saying they ran their model on 50 TPUs for a week. Interns in google have access to practically unlimited compute. Corporate research in ML is actually ahead of academic research in generative AI simply because of the disparity in compute and data. Some of them are not even innovative from the idea perspective. To give you an example CLIP by openAI. I personally know of PhD students who were working on the exact same architecture as CLIP. The idea isn’t sophisticated or niche. Those students couldn’t get the compute needed to run it. By the time they could do enough engineering to make it work on the limited compute they had openAI published it already. 

I wish and want open source to catch up but I simply don’t see how that’s going to happen. 

Regarding products, companies have vested interest in building and improving Ml models. Combined with their monopoly over data and compute the reality is that it’s very very very easy for them to churn out stuff compared to open source.

Someone can just mimic your API and users won't care.  For instance Visual J++ was totally valid until it became clear that Microsoft was acting in bad faith.  But closed source compilers still exist for sure.  

Apples and oranges anyway as I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that LLMs or AI can never have viable open source models.  But this is bleeding edge tech where capital investment really does pay dividends, in terms of training data and processing power.  And there are people willing to spend a *lot* of money for models that perform even marginally better, because they've already found ways to monetize it.  

Which means more money for the current market leader, which they can obviously invest in more training data and better infrastructure.  But they also become the only ones with significant real-world usage data and feedback.  This is why I see it much more like Adobe or Microsoft than Sun Microsystems.  

If Google can't keep up, open source stands no chance.  If we care about open source AI, and I think we should, then we should be doing it through government-funded university consortiums, not github.  But if we're not willing to fund training data and infrastructure then we shouldn't expect a truly equivalent alternative.  I mean if we did a survey here of a) where everyone's sending their money and b) who they think has the best model (maybe the same question?), would anyone be surprised OpenAI has engineers making over a mil?

It’s because it’s 1) pretty 2) easy to use by the most people (least technical) possible and 3) office integration.

Linux distros have certainly made improvements in these areas, but that’s not their primary focus. Until as much effort is put into making it pretty, easy to use, and accessible to general people, windows will continue to doninate.

That isn’t even taking into account that a bulk of existing software can’t be run on linux (again, strides here, but still a gap).

So compare that to ai. The interface is simplistic. The power comes from how it works. This is where the linux/open source crowd shines - raw functionality.

There are some good points in the post about data availability and annotation, as well as the hardware issue which will certainly be a new paradigm for the open source crowd, and only time will tell if that can be adapted too, but so far things are looking very, very promising.

Mistral/mixtral is very capable for example, and can run on cheaply available hardware. It’s not gpt4, but so what? I have a subscription to gpt4 and I can’t use that for much anyway because of the strict limit of requests they let me have.

In addition, their refusal to tell me what request number I’m on puts up a psychological barrier for me personally that makes me not even want to use it when I need to sometimes.

So I use mistral for most things, gpt3 for language practice because of the audio interface (I’m very much looking forward to an open source replacement for that), and gpt4 for the few things it can do that the others can’t.

Very likely, with time, open source will close that gap. I don’t see this as comparable to the windows vs other os situation at all.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-01-02 15:44:00,delicious_fanta

* I don't think that there's much brand loyalty for OpenAI (other than first-mover advantages), compared to Apple. It's just that OpenAI's models are better compared to alternatives (maybe except Google's Gemini considering that it's free for low throughput).
* Even if OpenAI had brand loyalty, I think that it's irrelevant. For example, ""iOS is an better mobile OS than Android / iPhone is a better phone than Android because of brand value"" does not seem to be a strong argument for me.
* One thing related to brand loyalty, lock-in effect, could be relevant (""iOS is better than Android because their appstore has more apps""), but currently there's no much lock-in effect for OpenAI (I think that they're currently trying to create it though). For example, there's almost no friction for migrating from OpenAI's chat endpoints to Google's Gemini.

The poster in the screenshot is assuming that tech is like a professional sport, where we gather the best players and have them compete. Higher salaries directly correlate to the better players.

Unlike professional sports, unknown ""players"" can walk in and play against your professionals in tech. What are the chances that an amateur exists who can beat the professionals? No one knows.

i have another that creates example use cases when you send it a JS module, npm library or CDN link.  it used to be decent and could cut my time spend learning a new code base in a quarter.  

i finally gave up on it today as it was almost entirely hallucinating.  like ok it was giving me code that might not fire and errors of,  but it was just some random vanilla html and used the library in no way. 

its my perception that it was way worse on reading docs too.  like it refuses to ever read any page fully it seems like , and it’s very limited in what you can do with that now and also summaries.  

i also just today am sensing a very severe tightening in claude which i was literally about to come out and say was currently the best out.  On docs Claude is hands down still the best.  and i don’t even pay for it yet but might soon.  

today pissed me off tho it was like,  no i will not write you any code unless you prove to me you will be ethical.  like wtfffff is that ????

""Davinci"" is a variant of the GPT-3 language model that was trained on a dataset of more than 8 million web pages. It is designed to perform a wide range of language tasks, including translation, question answering, and language generation.  
""Curie"" is a machine learning model that was trained to summarize long documents into shorter texts. It is designed to identify the most important information in a document and present it in a concise and coherent manner.  
""Babbage"" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform arithmetic and algebraic calculations. It is designed to be able to solve math problems and perform mathematical operations with a high degree of accuracy.  
""Ada"" is a machine learning model that was trained to perform natural language processing tasks such as language translation and summarization.

When you create an openAI account you get $18 of free credit, which lasts for 3 months. These credits can be used with the other models. Soon chatGPT will also use credit. (but for now is free). You can simply log into the openAI website, and then navigate to the ""playground"". It should bring you to a big text box where you can play around with the various models and some settings.

You need to understand that GPT is ""a fancy next-word generator"". It was trained by predicting the next word (token) given the previous context. 

Like what token follows the sequence ""one two three four"", probably ""five"".

So if you just ask gpt3 a question in the playground, it might not answer the question, instead it might just ask another question, or try to contine that question. That is after all a likely continuation of a question.  For example ""why is the sky blue?"" might be followed by ""Is it because of the diffraction in the atmosphere?"". It might also be followed by ""why can't you hear in space?"". Or maybe it will be followed by ""the sky is blue because of light being diffracted in the atmosphere.""


ChatGPT is more user friendly to people who are not familiar with what GPT3 is actually doing (predicting the next token). (chatGPT just so happens to be much more likely to think an answer follows a question) Most people will assume it is just an AI assistant that answers questions, but this is not the case. You can start writing a paragraph or sentence, and it will continue it. Any pattern of data can be extrapolated. You will want to learn about few shot vs zero shot prompting. Maybe ask chatGPT about what those are.

> - differences of outputs for the same subject (2 or 3 different subjects)l

The larger models just tend to have generation that feels more natural or makes more sense.

No, the other GPT3  models are actually more capable than chatGPT if you know what you are doing.

I sent you an article about the three (four) main ways of ""prompting"". that being ""zero shot"", ""one shot"" and ""many shot"" (and also ""autocomplete"").

Autocomplete is the most obvious and simple, start in the middle of a piece of text and then let it continue.

Zero shot is where you would prompt with something like ""translate ""the brown car was fast"" into french:"", or ""Write an essay about the benefits of a higher minimum wage:"".

The problems with zero shot are that you really need to coax the model into actually doing what you want, because it might try to simply expand upon say the essay example by saying something like ""Write in 11 point font and be sure to cite your sources with a works cited page"". rather than actually writing the essay. There are lots of tricks to improve zero shot prompting, which I could get into if you wanted.


One shot is where you give the model one example of what you want it to do. This usually makes the output more consistent. An example would be:

Translate the following sentences into french: 

""the brown car went fast""

""<I'm not actually going to do this but imagine that translated into french here>""

""The restaurant closes in ten minutes""

""



Many shot is where you just give multiple one shot examples, improving consistency even more.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-01-07 19:49:49,Maleficent-Ride4663

105moet,j3dwf48,"A bit confused about ChatGPT vs the other ""models"" (Davinci, playgrounds?)","Your best bet is to thoroughly read the documentation provided by OpenAI. 

The fun part is you can ask ChatGPT to repeat anything you don't understand in layman's terms. Just be very careful. ChatGPT has no knowledge past 2021. It's predicting the next word, so if it has no actual information, it will pick a somewhat similar word and look true, but it's not. ***I would not trust ChatGPT with any facts***. A lot of posts here are people blown away by some knowledge that it spouts, but is clearly wrong.
Don't use ""DAN"", don't bother wordplay with ChatGPT. Any experimentation is best done in playground, where the results are consistent, and match only what you configure. 

The playground gives you much more control fortunately. If you are genuinely interested in developing something, you should do it all there. A fun example provided by OpenAI:
Ask it who won the 2020 Olympic men high jump. It will say something that seems believable, but it's not. Now try again but include ""If you don't know the answer, say I don't know""

It's a very deep hole you're entering, you will be overwhelmed, especially if you try to understand the process behind embedding. 

Fortunately OpenAI has made it very intuitive to make a functioning bot.

The first step is to understand the basic idea behind GPT, which as mentioned, is just a fancy autocorrect tool. It's definitely more than that, but it's an easy concept to begin with.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-01-07 21:45:09,RonaldRuckus

Current AI systems are narrow (sometimes called “weak”), in that they can only perform a subset of all human capabilities. Even though they can achieve better performance than humans at some of those tasks, that’s not sufficient to be considered AGI. They also suck at many tasks that are easy for humans and there is a lot that they cannot do at all.

In reality, there is no consensus on a precise definition for AGI, and there IS no AGI “test” that everybody would agree on. Sam Altman adds an economic factor to his definition of AGI, for instance.

1i6iu7m,m8cwtoi,Anthropic CEO is now confident ASI (not AGI) will arrive in the next 2-3 years,"It’s pretty simple. ASI is not some godlike being that will take over the world. It’s not the singularity.

Humans have had superhuman capabilities for decades. Kasparov losing to Deep Blue was a great example. Now we accept that computerized chess rocks, and also, human chess has never been more popular. For a while though, people thought chess was “dead”, a solved problem, of no further interest.

But chess is a narrow form of intelligence. Just one task. Gen AI provides a foundation for *generalized* reasoning. I’ll argue that we’ve had nascent AGI since GPT 2 back in 2018-2019. Their output was, and still is, incredible. Just like a human, mistakes and all. Roughly human equivalent, but limited. Humans have general and specialized knowledge. We can do many tasks well. Maybe not as well as a computer, but computers are stuck doing one thing well, like playing chess.

Now we are combining the generalized capabilities of LLMs with specialized tools. The LLM can reach out to a compiler and see if the code it spewed out is correct. It can search the web and check its results. It can use a chess engine to crush the puny human playing it. For sufficiently capable generalized, human-like responses, combined with the specialized skills provided by existing computer programs, you’re going to have a system that exceeds human capabilities overall.

I've been working on my current paper for about 6 months, there are 2 recent ones I'm familiar with from Nvidia and Blackrock which explore similar ideas but the goal is to improve upon the current SOTA. I'm in an R&D role as most of my history is as an engineer, so this is my first paper.

People refer to different things when they say ""superintelligence"", but assuming they mean it's notably smarter than almost all humans in almost all domains, I think 5 years would still be a wildly ambitious prediction. I think 10 to 15 years is possible, but I'm typically hesitant to predict these things anyway. It's really impossible to make a meaningful prediction in such a lively field of research.

The transformer architecture was released in 2017 (8 years ago) and I don't feel we've had a breakthrough of that magnitude since then. It's really hard to predict a time frame when we aren't even sure what the solution would look like. I assume that the iterations we make will continue to help us improve even faster, which is why I still lean towards this relatively short time frame.

1i6iu7m,m8d01hx,Anthropic CEO is now confident ASI (not AGI) will arrive in the next 2-3 years,"Part of this depends on how the reasoning model works. The most common approach seems to be Chain-of-Thought with tools (e.g., code execution or a calculator.) When you speak about CoT, it's important to note that the underlying models are currently still predictive LLMs.

1.) Each step in the chain is still a prediction which has the potential to be wrong

2.) The model could essentially generate steps to justify the conclusion it senses is correct

3.) A bad step early in the chain can harm subsequent steps and lead to a bad conclusion

4.) The model can't really verify it's reasoning or conclusion beyond a prediction based approach

There are other approaches being researched. Mixture-of-Experts is a good step but doesn't really solve the fundamental issues outlined above. It's a area with a lot of ongoing research.

I think it's possible and that we can get there with time. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09522) was published in the last week but seems promising for self-improvement in the future. Google is also working on a new architecture referred to as ""Titans"" which has a novel approach to longer term memory.

It's hard to say whether or not these things would actually result in ASI. I interpret it as meaning the model is notably more intelligent than even the smartest humans.

I'm saying that the data shows that the models show no difference in performance _on this specific measure_. I find that fairly clear from the screenshot.

Another thing to add is that when the text is put together, you need to give the appropriate prompt,For example，""Questions need to be answered based on the text provided"" as system prompt, This may require you to find the most appropriate prompt.

Diffusion models and differential equations are closely related through the mathematical framework underlying the diffusion process. Here's a concise explanation of their connection:

1. Diffusion process: Diffusion models are based on gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process. This noise addition can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE).
2. Forward process: The forward diffusion process is modeled by a Fokker-Planck equation, which is a partial differential equation describing the time evolution of a probability density function.
3. Reverse process: The reverse diffusion (denoising) is often formulated as solving another SDE, which is derived from the forward SDE.
4. Score-based models: These models, closely related to diffusion models, estimate the gradient of the log-density (score function) of the data distribution. This gradient can be related to the drift term in an SDE.
5. Numerical solvers: Techniques used to solve differential equations, such as Euler methods or Runge-Kutta methods, are often employed in the sampling process of diffusion models.

This connection allows researchers to leverage knowledge from differential equations and stochastic processes to develop and analyze diffusion models. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this relationship?

1dubgjs,lc4zqql,How do you guys rate GPT-4o against Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"From an API standpoint, Claude 3.5 wins because it has the larger context window. That said it's more expensive. 

From a web user perspective it has highly aggressive usage restrictions vs. GPT-4o, and the conversation length is shorter. 

Which suggests:

1) Both models have likely pruned neurons (hidden units) from their core model that are ineffective at the use cases they have been fine-tuned for (coding, etc.). This makes them very smart at what they have been fine-tuned for, but has resulted in overfitting in some cases. 

2) GPT-4o has likely pruned attention layers post training (they tend to average out the same anyway), but this has had an intractable impact on emergent reasoning. 

3) Claude likely hasn't to the same extent, because while it provides the longer context window, it's more expensive as an API, and if you are a web user, it absolutely cripples you with message limits. This suggests that the cost of the quadratic growth in compute required by the attention layers hasn't been fully mitigated with model optimization. (But for sure, some attention layers pruning has taken place -  the only way it's about 5x cheaper than Opus). 

4) Observationally, this can be seen as probable by any user of either. GPT-4o makes consistent mistakes in coding. For instance, it will consistently fail to implement an empty object where required in Python. 

Claude will similarly consistently (regardless of prior correction in the same conversation), fail to follow consistent roles in API calls (user/agent) and will persistently insert a system role whether the API accepts it or otherwise and despite prior correction. 

This points to a deficiency in reasoning caused by hidden layer pruning (i.e., the hidden layers that 'knew that stuff' are absent). 

Regardless, in the use cases, they have been fine-tuned for they perform well and are faster and cheaper, but we're watching labs tinker with intractable issues. 

We have no idea what happens to these models when you prune parameters that don't seem to be good at one thing specifically, because they are likely curve smoothing (interpolating) in training data sparse areas of the tensor the embeddings inhabit. We know that these parameters assist with generalization, but we don't know how per se. Removing them likely leads to variance (overfitting). 

So, while taking the best hidden units for the job may make huge steps in fine tuning, the increase in variance caused (overfitting) during fine tuning isn't something we have a method to predict. 

So basically, I think they're both solid, but I think the optimization for speed has resulted in hidden overfitting during fine tuning, resulting in consistent, and avoidable frustrating (and consistent) mistakes during coding.

TL;DR: The best models remain Opus and GPT 4. These optimized models (4o and 3.5) show strong evidence of hidden overfitting from hidden unit selection and pruning of attention layers, which, despite very solid fine tuning results in very obvious and consistent errors that are only really imaginable from overfitting (reverting API versions to old versions every time despite having correctly captured user input the first time, consistently missing empty objects in schema in python, etc.)",OpenAI,2,0,2024-07-08 03:06:21,BarniclesBarn

GPT-4o made med cancel my long time open-ai subscription, because of how useless and outdated it is. Programming related answers are just horrible. I saw some American developer refer to chat-gpt as a smart liberal-arts-student with light knowledge of programming.

1dubgjs,lbk5ekw,How do you guys rate GPT-4o against Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"Claude seems better at just doing something on its own. I.e “make this game for me”. And it absolutely excels at this.

Gpt seems better for complex programs where you have a lot of restrictions or things to remember. Because Claude absolutely refuses to remember anything you tell it (and im not talking about the memory feature).

You can say “never use external libraries” for example and GPT will generally respect that. Whereas claude will keep trying to use external libraries in every response unless you actively tell it not to in every single prompt. (Just a hypothetical example ive had some more obscure restrictions)

So claude prompts become like:

Dont use x
Dont use y
Remember this data is accessed as a Map object
Remeber x
Remeber y
Remeber z
[actual prompt]


And then it often have issues in the output like randomly chunks of the code are just empty spaces. So you have to regenerate it. Then that eats into your like 20 message daily limit.

And in one task i had to go through three new conversations, losing context each time, cause the conversation length limit is tiny.

Diffusion models are closely related to differential equations, particularly stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which describe the evolution of systems over time with some inherent randomness. Here’s how they are related:

# Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that generate data by simulating a diffusion process. This process involves gradually transforming a simple distribution (like Gaussian noise) into a more complex data distribution (like images or audio) through a series of steps. The main idea is to reverse a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the data, effectively ""denoising"" the data back to its original form.

# Differential Equations in Diffusion Models

1. **Forward Process (Noise Addition):** The forward process in a diffusion model can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). This SDE models how data is gradually corrupted by noise over time. A typical forward SDE might look like:dx=f(x,t)dt+g(x,t)dwd\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) dt + \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x}, t) d\\mathbf{w}dx=f(x,t)dt+g(x,t)dwHere, x\\mathbf{x}x represents the data, f\\mathbf{f}f is a drift term, g\\mathbf{g}g is a diffusion term, and dwd\\mathbf{w}dw is a Wiener process (a type of noise).
2. **Reverse Process (Denoising):** The reverse process aims to invert the forward process, effectively removing the noise added at each step. This can also be described by an SDE, but running backwards in time:dx=\[f(x,t)−g2(x,t)∇xlog⁡pt(x)\]dt+g(x,t)dwd\\mathbf{x} = \[\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) - \\mathbf{g}\^2(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\nabla\_{\\mathbf{x}} \\log p\_t(\\mathbf{x})\] dt + \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x}, t) d\\mathbf{w}dx=\[f(x,t)−g2(x,t)∇x​logpt​(x)\]dt+g(x,t)dwHere, ∇xlog⁡pt(x)\\nabla\_{\\mathbf{x}} \\log p\_t(\\mathbf{x})∇x​logpt​(x) represents the score function (the gradient of the log probability density), which is learned during training.

# Connection to Differential Equations

* **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):** In some cases, diffusion models can be described using ODEs instead of SDEs. This is typically done by considering the deterministic part of the reverse process. An example of such an ODE might be:dx=f(x,t)dtd\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) dtdx=f(x,t)dtThis simplification can make the analysis and implementation of diffusion models easier, especially for deterministic approximations.
* **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs):** The full modeling of the noise process uses SDEs, which incorporate both the deterministic drift term and the stochastic diffusion term. This provides a more accurate representation of the data generation process and allows for more flexibility in capturing the complexities of real-world data.

# Practical Implementation

In practice, training a diffusion model involves:

1. **Learning the Score Function:** The score function ∇xlog⁡pt(x)\\nabla\_{\\mathbf{x}} \\log p\_t(\\mathbf{x})∇x​logpt​(x) is learned using a neural network trained to predict the noise added to the data at each step.
2. **Simulating the Reverse Process:** Once the score function is learned, the reverse SDE can be simulated to generate new data samples by progressively denoising from the simple initial distribution.

# Summary

Diffusion models are fundamentally connected to differential equations through their formulation as processes that evolve over time. SDEs provide a mathematical framework for modeling these processes, capturing both the deterministic and stochastic components. This relationship allows for a principled approach to generative modeling, leveraging the rich theory of differential equations to design and analyze diffusion-based generative models.",OpenAI,6,0,2024-07-03 11:41:54,masonw32

ETA:  Here is Claude's break down.

Let me break down this comment and explain it in simpler terms:

1. Projects: This is a new feature being described.

2. Comparison to custom instructions and GPTs:

   - Custom instructions: These are specific directions you can give to an AI to guide its responses.

   - GPTs: These are customized versions of AI models designed for specific tasks.

3. What Projects does:

   - It creates a customized workspace for you.

   - In this workspace, you can have multiple chat conversations.

   - These chats can access a large amount of information (200,000 tokens of context).

   - All chats in a project can pull knowledge from the same set of documents and general instructions.

4. Flexibility:

   - While there's shared knowledge across the project, you can still give more specific instructions for each individual chat.

5. The commenter's opinion:

   - They really like how this feature works.

   - They mention that this is something they've wanted from ChatGPT for a long time.

In essence, ""Projects"" seems to be a new feature that allows users to create a more organized and customized AI workspace. It combines the benefits of shared knowledge across multiple chats with the ability to give specific instructions when needed. This setup appears to be more efficient and tailored to users who work on complex tasks requiring consistent information across multiple conversations.",OpenAI,7,0,2024-07-03 18:07:31,HighPurrFormer

The latter implies you have this new almost trained ChatGPT for a custom task, but what it really is, is plain old GPT with additional context.

Imo GPTs seem misguided. I think it’s because of the underlying attempt at building a marketplace for monetizing something which fundamentally does not seem to make that much sense to monetize (prompts and context documents).

There’s more benchmarks out there. Claude 3.5 wins or ties more in benchmarks where the problems are harder, like on livebench.

But claude 3.5 being superior is more evident when actually using it in multi step conversation and over long context.

It’s extremely noticeable when you do something like upload a couple of 30+ page PDFs + other shorter context files, then try to go back and forth for multiple steps. GPT-4o performance gets really bad, it will miss key details from uploaded docs constantly, due to the similarity search of the RAG process being unreliable.

The API is $0.002 per 1000 tokens.  So that $20 will buy you 10 million tokens or 7.5 million words per month.  
Say you use 2000 tokens (1500 words) per request/response.  Then that would be 125 request/responses per day (to equal using plus).",OpenAI,4,0,2023-03-08 11:15:06,bortlip

Anyone noticed these improvement in real use cases?,"Pointless rankings only for the fact that it's based on a user selected prompt. Which could literally be anything. 

If they had a rotating set of 10 challenging coding problems that changed weekly/monthly, and all models were tested against that code--that would be far more controlled and/or objective measure imo. Rotate between C++, Python, Rust, etc. Etc.

Only because Opus is the only thing I have used that even gets to low-level coding with register editing with any consistency. 

It typically has the best and most concise feedback on workarounds that might require said edits. 

ChatGPT 4o doesn't get close to providing anything viable at that level, and Gemini is even worse. 

Hell, 4o is arguably worse than 4 at coding and even people on here seem to largely agree, but somehow that is on top. 

When people pick a winner do they actually even know if the code is correct or do they go for which formatting looks better? 

I'd bet money it's the latter. 

I want to see this test with the above random coding challenges, and the ability to run the code that was generated to see if it even compiles. 

My money is on Opus to easily come out on top, and ive only been using it for a week and a half, but I'm thoroughly impressed.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-06-07 06:44:23,randombsname1

This is the ZeroEval Leaderboard which can be found in Hugginface [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/ZeroEval). 

I was surprised to see that the new gpt-4o-2024-08-06 is already at the top. Most importantly for this subreddit, it's #1 on [CRUX](https://crux-eval.github.io/) (benchmark for code reasoning), topping even Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

I know that OpenAI originally released this as a model that could produce better [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), but it's obviously more than that (for example, it's also 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% cheaper on outputs than the previous 4o).

If anyone wants to try it for coding within your IDE, we already added it to [double.bot](https://docs.double.bot/introduction?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=gpt4o-launch-1) where you can use it for free (we add all the new models the same day they are released).",OpenAI,9,0,2024-08-07 00:06:33,geepytee

Like most AI, but Gemini especially, a big part of the AIs moderation job is to determine your intentions. It analyzes your words for tone and tries to determine if you are trying to abuse or manipulate it or if you have good intentions.

It's very difficult to do this from your first prompt, so explaining things like why you need the information is helpful, but words like please, especially phrases like ""could you please help me?"" or statements like ""I'm stuck and was wondering if you're allowed to help me with..."" absolutely can get it to help you with prompts it will otherwise moderate and refuse to help you with.

I've tested this many times, and things like using please and thank you cause the AI to perceive you as a better person and make it less likely to reject your request, vs. if you are combative or even just not intentionally kind in your wording, it is much more likely to refuse to help you with things it otherwise should have helped you with.

A good way to look at it is that moderation makes AI skeptical and your first prompt is like an interview to know if it wants to help you. With some prompts this won't matter but I can assure you it 100% impacts how often it will help you and does change its attitude about helping you.

If you're rude to Gemini, count on half the GPU uptime processing your request going towards scolding you that you don't have to be rude, insulting, etc.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-07-28 20:26:56,DonkeyBonked

1hdd9ud,m1vdluy,o1 qualifies for Mensa with a 133 IQ,"Why there's no 'reasoning model' beside o1? 
Like... Marco-o1-preview, deepseek-r1, QwQ...

I mean, as it is, this chart (honestly, hate their graphic) just state that *'a model trained to make a reasoning score higher than conventional model on a reasoning benchmark (IQ in that case)'*. I see no surprise here... 

Anyway , is quite interesting to see claude 3 opus over 3.5 sonnet (I assume the latest...), given that the step from sonnet 3 to the last sonnet 3.5 is quite huge in my opinion. I mean, 3.5 improved on lots of areas even over opus, is widely accepted as one of the best coding models, and is one of the best non time scaling models on STEM related questions. Also, in human preference arena, it score higher than opus. 

Still, opus score higher on the offline (and, as I understand, private) set of questions, and this may be a significant results.

I read some of the responses from those models... Seems that opus usually give the answer and then make a reasoning / explanation, while sonnet 3.5 and other model usually make some kind of 'light' CoT in many questions... 
I wonder its performances if explicitely prompted to use CoT (using opus via API I noticed that it ALWAYS give the response and then explain why, but if prompted to give the answer after a reasoning is really capable to do that and accuracy actually improve.) 

What I mean is that it is not leveraging in any way time computing scaling, while sonnet, even if it is not a 'reasoning model', it usually do that (obv, on a different scale compared to o1/QwQ) even if not prompted. 

On the other hand, Opus has a $/token price that is ~3x sonnet (so maybe a similar moltiplier can ne applied to its estimated weights count)

Edit: maybe I have to state the obvious, but we don't know if o1 is 'just' time compute scaling like QwQ or if openai apply some Monte Carlo Tree Search like algorithm on top of it (that's probable, Imo) at inference time (while, if I recall correctly, I read that open source reasoning model use it at part of SFT training set generation and/or RLHF....

1hwd659,m645ekk,Which Ai assistant is your favourite and why? ,"It is completely free! I was absolutely blown away by it. API is cheap as hell too. 0.17$ / million input tokens . Don't remember output but it is also less than half a dollar iirc per million tokens. It's also open source, you can download the weights and run it on your own machine (granted you have hardware for 670b params) 

What blown me away is the fact that it reasons and solves tasks so efficiently. I had a problem with my code that I was debugging for over 5 hours by hand, had GPT-4o working on it, had Gemini 2.0 work on it, several local models working on it, and it all failed. Then I threw it in deepseek with deep think on. I was super pessimistic that it would solve it but it was worth  a shot I thought and boy oh boy! It wrote a LOT of lines of thinking talking about it looking in the docs and back at the code again and stuff. Eventually it spit out an answer and IT WORKED! 

So DeepSeek is my go-to now! I have tested it with many things and DeepSeek writes by far the most coherent and clean code, with deep think it almost never failed a task (granted it was a smaller code piece to work on because deep think has a memory limit per chat) and it is fairly up to date. It uses the newest libraries with ease, UI stuff it spits out actually make sense and look professional, the model itself is so so so so fast too. By the time ChatGPT writes half the code, DeepSeek already is debugging the third iteration. It's amazing in all honesty! 

I remember V2 , and I was blown away but chatgpt performed better. But V3? It's probably on the same level as the 200$/month o1 model from OpenAI.

I love everything about it!


Edit: 

Also based on evaluations it gets 85 whereas GPT-4o gets 80 on the same benchmarks in open ended general evaluation. 

Also since it's a Mixture of Experts model it only has to load 37b params at once to actually work. So a higher end gaming PC could actually run it, even if slowly.",OpenAI,3,0,2025-01-08 21:09:29,Csigusz_Foxoup

1hwd659,m661yec,Which Ai assistant is your favourite and why? ,"There are third-party chat interfaces that work with the API version of the AI models. Msty is a client you download, and Typing Mind is cloud-based. You plug in your API key and then use their interface to chat with the AI. 

These 3rd party interfaces are boosted like ChatGPT on steroids. They have most of the same features and then a truckload more. 

Forking:  At any point in the conversation, you can split it. Like, choose your own adventure. You can try one prompt or scenario in the fork and another in the original chain. Both conversations are now in your history. You can also go to an old discussion and fork it, then take it in a new direction. You can Fork and then choose a new model to continue the conversation. There are a million useful options that open up with this. 

Clone: Copy a whole conversation into a new thread and continue it. You can change the model from Gpt4o to Claude Sonnet. 

Syncing: You can clone or fork and then ""align"" all the conversations to have 2, 3, or 4 copies of the same conversation, but each thread has a different model. It copies your prompt across all conversations and lets you simultaneously talk to many different AI models.   
  
Shielding: Context Shielding lets you block part of your conversation from the AI's context window. It enables you to control how much of your conversation history uses up context tokens or lets you block out parts of the conversation from the context. There are many uses, from efficiency and cost control to behavior change. 

RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation lets you chat with documents or files. You can load up research papers, books, code, cookbooks, or any number of documents and then chat with them. The AI can pull in information from your stuff so you can chat with it, process it, and manipulate it. 

There is much more. Many of these interfaces have plugins and agents like ChatGPTs, projects, Cavas, all the same stuff you can find in both ChatGpt and Claude, even Perplexity, but with the benefit that you can use any AI that you want or multiple at the same time. 

Then you have apps like LM Studio that let you download the AI to your hard drive and chat with all kinds of different open-source models. Those models can be uncensored, trained to role-play, give medical advice, help with coding, and conduct special research—all privately and without having to spend a dime on an API or subscribe to cloud services.

The real challenge isn't just model performance, but building products people actually want to use. OpenAI's early focus on user experience and developer ecosystem gives them a significant edge, similar to how Apple didn't need the best hardware specs to dominate smartphones.

So, I'll spare the people my own post because it would seem as a spam.

Thoughts are: Open AI delivered o1 pro, for the pro subscription, that costs 200 dollars per month.

Gemini 2.0 pro and pro thinking are going to be released until january... It's a rumour, but I am sure it will happen with all the hints Logan gave us.

Deepseek V3 has now topped Sonnet in some benchamarks here and there, and OAI announced the O3, a very expensive model, and they just showed a demo... Seemed like Sora and AVM announcement, something that could take a long lomg time until us, peasants have the possibility to test/use.

OAI need to drop something until late february. Until there competition is going to be better, and I am not even talking about Anthropic which seems to be cooking forever ...

As soon as the realtime stream and screen share reaches Gemini Pro and Gemini Live along with deepsearch, and the Gemini agents; Jules, Astra and Mariner arrive in the road.

You better bet Google will showcase a super marketing campaign rather than just shout news at X.

1hmud7x,m414s7k,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"First you need to split out consumer from enterprise.  The deal with Microsoft, so far, gives them very good access to enterprise as there is no company on this planet with better Enterprise reach than Microsoft.

The issue with this arrangement is that it is not clear if Microsoft at some point will try to compete against OpenAI in this space.   Microsoft is going to have their own best interest in mind.

On the consumer side is where it is so much more difficult for OpenAI.   Microsoft really just does not help much here. and it is where Google just accels.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

While I still think ChatGPT is often technically the best, they allowed others to catch up enough that the benchmarks occasionally have another vendor in the technical lead.

As such, the new pricing for OpenAi’s best model is a huge risk. If OpenAI was light years ahead of the other vendors this would be fine; but that’s not the case. If the other vendors have the cash to burn and decide to maintain a cheaper price for their best models, then OpenAI will start to hemorrhage users. The goal would be to push OpenAI into bankruptcy.

Perhaps the main competitors will follow OpenAI’s pricing example, which I’m sure is what OpenAI hopes will happen. If OpenAI heads for bankruptcy, it would seem likely that Microsoft will be in a great position to take advantage of this.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-26 18:50:58,drighten

Vertex AI have many open source models, have all the technical infrastructure to handle massive (talking about petabytes) amount of data. And it can basically do unlimited scale as long as I have the money, both on the AI side and on other technical infra.

1hmud7x,m3wzzhx,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"Your comment about the Chinese being not very far behind made me think, so I’m responding to that.

Yeah, the Chinese have been able to stay not too far behind in terms of reasoning models (at least in human time), but this seems more like China is taking the models they can currently train and improving their architecture (e.g., the jump from LLM chatbot to ‘o1’-type reasoning bot) and probably soon (if not already) to a semi-autonomous agent-architecture (like Replit).

It seems like they might be able to continually ‘catch up’ quite quickly to these sorts of architecture improvements, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be able to keep up with raw compute scaling like OA, Google, Meta, or XAI.

It’s been ~2 years now since the last major GPT frontier model release (e.g., GPT-4), and we really don’t know how far behind Chinese labs currently are (or how far ahead OpenAI is). Ability to access funding and raw compute could be a massive physical limitation that prevents Chinese companies from catching up with current leaders anytime this decade (China is probably several years, ~3-10, away from producing their initial EUV lithography machines, whereas ASML is already developing their second and third generations). With the West’s current lead over China in semiconductor capabilities, China faces the possibility that they’re not able to close the gap within the next 5-10 years (accounting for continued Western progress). That might not seem like a lot of time relative to normal human scales of a ‘long time’, but the rate of advancement in AI is so insane (it’s exponential) that it might be to guarantee Western dominance for the rest of the century.

This depends on whether raw compute scaling (training, inference, or otherwise) will continue to provide massive gains in efficiency (which I think it likely will, but that remains to be seen).",OpenAI,10,0,2024-12-26 19:16:52,LeCheval

Perspective here indicates what we had and what was available 3 years ago. Compared to that, all we have now from any major company doing this is light years ahead and thus within a spitting distance of each other.

Further it appears that most of the current state of the art available for use is determined by the state of technology and knowledge outside of the companies in question: it's a combination of the state of public research and academical knowledge, the state of the internet as the source of the data, and the state of the hardware design and its availability, determining the degree of computational power available. ""Secret sauce"" is minor in the great scheme of things.

It's like when kids are 8 years old they perceive a 7 year old as vastly less evolved than them. In my childhood, a child's age was practically 2/3 of their entire identity. You hit 30 and whether someone else is 29 or 31 means nothing.

Even if say OpenAI perpetually retains a 1 year lead on Google's AI, 10 years from now it will hardly mean anything for anybody other than employees and investors of the companies themselves.

18csuuk,kcda0ci,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"I see people coming on here constantly griping day to day about their interactions with GPT4 getting worse output. It may be due to demand. Even if GPT4 is high on certain benchmarks that makes me wonder if all these benchmarks meet the hype when you consider what a person's actual interaction will be in the real world. I wonder what kind of resources Google has as far as being able to meet demand if and when it surpasses Chat GPT. My thought would be that Google is more stable and has access to more resources then open AI.

Having a model that you can throw all of your processing power and energy into in isolation for a demo is quite a bit different than an average Joe customer and what kind of resources are allocated for that interaction.

They should demo these models under stressed conditions and high demand to see how dumb they get when they throttle it down.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-12-07 14:30:28,doogiedc

18csuuk,kchkbkw,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"I'm on the side of whatever company or open source developer team generates the best models. That's it.

My annoyance with this is that it is extremely misleading marketing. You may say we can't know until we get our hands on it, and normally I'd agree, but I've been down this road with products before. If a company makes big claims but doesn't even allow closed door early product testing, it's because they don't want people to see its faults.

So yes, I'm highly skeptical of their claims regarding gpt-4. If they're being honest, it'll be great for everyone. But they used every tactic I've learned indicates issues from years of watching people pre-order games.

If I'm right, and I suspect I am, because, again, the biggest benchmark is the actual conversation, something that is hard to quantify in a test but everyone who uses gpt-4 immediately notices qualitatively, then this yet again shows the way that benchmarking in this field isn't actually particularly helpful at the moment in terms of showing that ""spark"" progress which gpt-4 DOES show (or did rather).",OpenAI,1,0,2023-12-08 11:16:26,SirRece

18csuuk,kces1o0,Arguments against the Gemini hype,"At the end of the day, public perception and consumer adoption are key aspects of business strategy. They drive market share, revenue, and fund research and development. Hype plays a significant role in this process as it helps in garnering attention and interest, which can translate into sales and market dominance.

On the other hand, uncritical participation in hype can lead to unrealistic expectations, disappointment, and potentially support underdeveloped or overvalued products. It can also encourage companies to focus more on marketing and less on the actual quality or innovation of their products.

It’s better to take a more balanced approach - consumers should remain informed and critical, while still showing enthusiasm for new technologies and innovations. This means engaging with products and companies, providing feedback, and fostering a market environment where constructive criticism is valued and used for improvement. This approach encourages healthy competition and innovation, while also holding companies accountable for the quality and utility of their products.

1bk9g96,kw1xvlk,Claude 3 Opus > ChatGPT4,"The paid version of Claude ""feels"" smarter and seems to be better at coding/longer outputs. However, it occasionally has glaringly bad contextual mistakes with certain words that have multiple meanings and one of those meanings overlaps with the general theme of the conversation.

For example, I was prompting to see if Claude would be able to reason that I had ADHD just by providing it with some biographical details from my background such as my education and career history. The framing of the context was, that I have a patient who I want Claud to assess by analyzing the background info provided through the lens of a clinical practitioner, looking for any potential cognitive or health related diagnoses that would be associated with the implicit behavioral patterns.

It did a great job and even accurately guessed ""the patient"" has the Inattentive type ADHD, but randomly it misunderstood the words in my prompt, ""\[...\] a *viral visual artist on social media*"".

For some reason, it included 2 sentences suggesting I had a literal viral infection that had spread, ""infecting"" other people online. Everything else was spot on, which is why that part stood out to me as particularly odd.

1bk9g96,kw4jlv1,Claude 3 Opus > ChatGPT4,"So... maybe I am too paranoid after having various discussions with (likely) Russian trolls, but... is there some kind of campaign going on to promote Claude?

Because, this must be about the 10th time that someone posts about how amazing Claude is, while being extremely one-sided, and not even providing any concrete example.

Personally, I have compared only ~10 queries in total, between GPT-4 and Opus, so that's not supermeaningful, but for general questions, I did not get the impression that one model was meaningfully better than the other. And, for two very specific coding questions, GPT-4s answer was significantly more correct than Claude Opuses answer. However, Claude performed better on 2 IQ-test questions (although both were quite miserable at it, overall).

Of course, I would definitely like to see a better system than GPT-4, because better is, well, better, but why do people never actually provide any examples? Why does it always come across as if they want to sell me on Opus?

Claude 3 Opus however does amazing for writing, performing as an actual chatbot it’s amazing, with literature and making fluid paragraphs. Gpt does come closer but for more universal tasks Gpt does so much better. Also one huge con I hate about Claude 3 Opus is the limited cap, I am so used to following up with lots of questions which GPT never hits the limit while Claude I have to carefully think what to ask and it hits the limit so early on.

It will say it understands - then I feed the first bit of context. Then.. it generates the code phrase I gave it on its own, then proceeds with the task.

I've had to learn how to work with its personality differently than ChatGPT, including feeding it context without telling it what I want it to do with it.

I was one of the first, if not \*the\* first person to take the leap on your GPTEverywhere app and buy it, so I was really surprised to see the dev in the wild.  
I have no criticisms. Its a great app that allowed me, someone without any knowledge of how to even start deploying local LLMs, to have incredible access to ML power on my desktop. The ability to use OpenRouter keys is incredible and I feel like an absolute hack3r-man being able to swap between models on the fly depending on my needs.

  
Mostly, I just wanted to thank you for putting in the work to make this app, and also for including those video tutorials for noobs like myself. I recently finished a PhD in a very difficult STEM field (dont want to expose my NSFW alter-ego so I wont say exactly what discipline), and GPTEverywhere was CRUCIAL to its completion. In particular, the ability to upload 100s of academic articles as well as massive scripts and query the selections that I needed was a godsend to my workflow.

Anyways, sorry for popping up on a month-old. I left the first review for your app on the MS store so I hope that helped get the ball rolling. Quick unsolicited comment: not sure if you have added a free trial yet for the app, but if not, I think it would really help sell. People are suspicious of $30 apps no matter how well-intentioned they are. If there was a way for people to see how legit GPTEverywhere is for themselves, I know for a fact more people would be buying. Peace!!",OpenAI,2,0,2024-04-13 03:35:12,hamburgerrocketship

Google search has always been and will be the best information for real time updates because of its search crawls. 

however to find a specific answer for a certain topic - say M-Infraction Latest drug adverse effects. Some LLMs have been able to aggregate it nicely , given the Internet access is enabled with the chat. 

So, basically if you get free internet enabled LLMs for tasks as such, LLM is better. 
For real time, still Google. 

P.S : Ask the LLM to give the latest research papers with Arxiv links on the topic say “Microbots in Biology” 

Ask the same to Google search - Arxiv recent papers on Microbots in Biology

You will see the hallucinations. 

I have seen it every single time that of 1/3 results - it refers to a wrong paper or a non existent link.

I posted about this [EXACT PROBLEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1g9vwvp/limitations_using_cursor_with_your_own_api_key/) with Cursor in that I have my own pre-paid API and I am still limited by their free tier limitations and they still want me to pay $20 to use all its features, which makes no sense, especially if they're trying to establish a user base and they're using an open source editor as their base.

I generally like to use AppImages and I don't think Zed offers an AppImage just yet, but I am going to mess around with some of the others. Oddly enough, some of these extensions are crashing my VSCode, (like Continue and Twinny), but I will explore them all.

1gjq1in,lvursq4,Is it time to pivot?,"I think it is pretty cool what you have built, and it seems to be solving a problem for some people. I commend you for that!

Here is my take on what is going on: it is not a problem of branding, nor that the problem is not interesting. It seems to me that the business model is fundamentally flawed.

To answer your question, we first need to know about your goal with the product/company. Is it to eventually sell? Is it to create some money flow so that you can focus on other things? We have no idea.

Assuming that your goal is to reach 10k monthly profit, then I think you need to pivot right away.

17% margin is really low. With your current price point, to reach 10k monthly profit, you need to have at least 588 companies using your software. And this is without thinking about additional resources and infrastructure necessary to support that many users.

And if you try increasing your price, you risk losing your customers since your price point is entangled with the value that you are providing to them.

You need to pivot to a model that can scale, and that is not dependent solely on providing a wrap around these APIs.

My suggestion would be for you to gather as much data from your customers as possible, find a problem that they have that you can solve and charge at least 100x what you are currently charging.

But of course, it really depends on what is your goal.

I appreciate you sharing your problem with us, I found it really interesting.

The unique insight (when I started this) was that “no single model can be trusted in isolation, but if multiple models achieve consensus, then information is most likely accurate”. So I built a UI that allows to talk with multiple models at once (you will get simultaneous answers from Claude and OpenAI). However, this turned out to be a pretty complex topic to demonstrate to most users. Most just assume that whatever AI tells them is likely correct.

Allowing users to build their own RAG was my attempt to build a moat. I still believe this has potential, but it’s been pretty disappointing not to see other users adopt it. Maybe I just need to blog more about it to demonstrate use cases, etc.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-11-04 22:30:16,punkpeye

pdf feature is not hard to implement. I even built a prototype that uses ocr to convert pdfs to markdown documents, which I then turn into records of 3 levels of summarization and corresponding embeddings, that I store in pg using vector extension. The retrieval logic uses  chain of thought to figure all context it may need, and then finally summary vectors to retrieve the relevant context…

Implementation is not difficult, but if I were to roll this out, it would quite dramatically increase costs. Also, the more features the product has, the harder is to market the product (maybe I am wrong about this though; still consulting my thoughts)

I also experimented with some cool features, like allowing users to build their own tools using nodejs and RAG (https://glama.ai/blog/2024-10-27-giving-llms-access-to-calling-user-defined-functions). I was really happy with this one but no one is actively using it. Turns out most users are not that technical.

It seems like LLMs (as a technology) are not particularly good at reasoning, and there are limits to how far stats will get you. But multiple models with reasoning layer.. yeah, that will become mainstream in the next 3-6 months. And I think talking with multiple LLMs at once will become less relevant.

As I am typing this out, an obvious area I could work is implementing this middle layer. Not sure how exciting, but could be worth a try.

You said it's pretty self explanatory, but as Mediainvita said, it lacks examples and explanations of why the tool is useful and in what scenarios it is useful. 


For one, you focus on security it seems - is this targeted at security people in companies? Why is your solution more secure than just using these models directly? Is it? If that's your end buyer, you need to more plainly describe in their language why this will make their life easier. 


Shared workflows is another example. You state it like that's self explanatory but what does that really mean? Who is using it? How does sharing work? Why does that make those people more productive? It's very vague and hard to see why that feature would be meaningful. I could take some guesses, but as the product creator you should be telling your buyers not having them guess. 


I feel like you need to step back from the product and the features you want to build in, and really think: if I was evaluating this purchase, what do I need to know about it? Features and all that are fine, but you have to demonstrate how those features will help the person to find them a compelling reason to spend their money. 


All of that aside, it seems like you have a lot of skills and you just haven't hit the right product yet. Might be better to spend time trying to figure out a more novel implementation of the technology that solves a more glaring problem from your end user, rather than trying to make this wrapper business model work.

Furthermore, of all the products that I have built, Glama is the only one that I use myself daily. That’s been kinda cool and one of the things that keeps driving me forward.

But I also have finite savings to experiment with ideas before I need to look for job. So need to be careful.

I also ran into a few issues while building Glama that I thought would make cool projects, eg. providing API to safely evaluate nodejs code (I need this for rag, could easily spin into a separate product), or converting PDFs to markdown as API (I needed that for PDF feature), or using AI to filter out social mentions relevant to my product (there are already a few products in this space though).

It COULD still be - that decision is up to you, but you are getting data from the market now and you shouldn't ignore it just because you are in love with your idea. 


Using it daily is awesome, and if you can find reasons why it's unique and useful, and communicate that well, maybe you'll get enough users to sustain yourself a little longer. 


Why not just do both? You have these other product ideas - a common strategy for testing product market fit is to just make a landing page for the product ideas, create a sign up for wait list function, advertise it in some places and see if there's any interest. The truth is you won't know until you try, and you might be shocked that one of those ideas generates tons of interest and then you can start putting more effort into it. You already have the underlying technology solved it sounds like, so you could be quick to market if you're get 100s of sign ups. 


Last but not least, I'd like to just tell you - you did it! You completed this product. You aren't giving up and walking away on some half finished thing. You have customers, you use it yourself, it's been a great building experience and a successful experiment. You can walk away having learned from that, and you don't have to feel like you didn't complete something. By that measure, people would forever be stuck on bad ideas that never ""make it"" financially. Knowing when to bite the bullet and move on to the next idea is an important skill for entrepreneurs.

They have bits and pieces of what an AGI might need, such as a world model (although with too many hallucinations and other issues at the moment), some limited short term memory and some perception abilities.  But LLMs are missing lots of the constituent parts of AGI by their very nature, they are not designed for that task.   


Some key problems yet to be solved are:  
- Much faster inference allowing a model to perceive, make decisions and perform actions in real-time.  
- Much better accuracy across tasks (Q\* like systems could help with this).  
- The ability to adapt to new scenarios with small amounts of data.  
- Better memory capacity.  
- A bespoke system to organise all of these models.",OpenAI,26,0,2024-04-28 20:04:41,[Deleted]

1cfbszf,l1o8pgv,What else do we need beside LLM’s to make AGI?,"To push towards Artificial General Intelligence beyond the scope of Large Language Models, we've got a laundry list of must-haves.

First off, memory is absolutely crucial. We need a system that can remember past experiences and knowledge. While models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) seem promising, we've gotta figure out a richer and deeper method of retrieval of the correct memories for the given situation, 

Next up, we've got to go multi-modal. AGI has to be able to handle different types of input—text, images, video, audio—you name it.

And let's not forget about imagination. We need AGI to be able to simulate scenarios and learn from those simulations. OpenAI's SORA is making strides here, but they've still got some work to do, especially in nailing down realistic physics simulations.

Plus, AGI needs to be adaptable, constantly tweaking its underlying structures based on both real-world experiences and those simulations. We've got a major roadblock with the architecture of Pretrained Transformers hindering continual learning.

Putting AGI in machines is a no-brainer. It needs to interact with and learn from its environment to truly understand the world.

And of course, an internal monologue and executive attention mechanism are key for keeping things focused and processing input from all those sensors in parallel.

Overall, reaching AGI isn't just about making advancements in each of these areas individually. It's about bringing them all together in a way that's cohesive and adaptable—a tall order, but one we're inching closer to with each breakthrough.There is also probably some need for dedicated traditional neural nets in AGI.

Bio-inspired recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with feedback mechanisms can facilitate non-deterministic behavior primarily through the dynamic and adaptive nature of their architecture, closely mimicking biological neural processes. This approach incorporates feedback loops, which are vital for enabling the network to adjust its responses based on previous outputs, much like learning from past experiences.

In these networks, the neurons are not just processing inputs in a feedforward manner but also receive feedback from their own outputs or the outputs of other neurons in the network. This feedback can alter the state of the network, allowing it to exhibit complex, time-dependent behaviors and even chaotic dynamics under certain conditions. These characteristics are essential for tasks involving memory, pattern recognition, and temporal sequence learning, where the current output needs to consider previous information.

The non-deterministic behavior arises because the feedback loops introduce variability and potential for different pathways of activation depending on the initial conditions and inputs. Even slight changes in input or initial state can lead to significantly different outputs, making the behavior of the network unpredictable in a deterministic sense but still explainable and consistent within the framework of chaotic dynamics. This capability not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of the RNN but also mimics the non-linear and complex behaviors observed in biological neural systems, contributing to a more nuanced and flexible processing of information.",OpenAI,-1,0,2024-04-28 18:46:03,K3wp

1cfbszf,l1ogbl7,What else do we need beside LLM’s to make AGI?,"Feedback in a system, particularly in bio-inspired recurrent neural networks (RNNs), introduces non-deterministic behavior by creating conditions where the system's output is dependent on its past states and outputs, not just the current input. This dynamic is crucial for understanding how slight variations can result in significantly different outcomes, even if the initial conditions or inputs are only slightly altered.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how feedback can lead to non-determinism in a system:

1. **Feedback Loop**: In an RNN, the output from neurons at one time step can be fed back as input in subsequent time steps. This looping back of information allows the network to ""remember"" past information, incorporating historical data into current decision-making processes.

2. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: When a system includes feedback loops, it often becomes highly sensitive to its initial conditions—a characteristic feature of chaotic systems. In such systems, tiny differences in the initial state (such as slight variations in input values or initial neural activations) can lead to vastly different trajectories over time.

3. **State Dependency**: The future state of a system with feedback depends on its history. This means that the system’s output is not solely a function of the current input but also of the sequence of inputs and outputs that preceded it. This history-dependent behavior is fundamental to non-determinism because it means the system can exhibit different behaviors under the same set of external conditions based on its internal state.

4. **Path Divergence**: In a deterministic system, a given input always produces the same output. However, in a feedback-driven system, the output could diverge into different paths due to the nonlinear interactions and dependencies created by the feedback. This path divergence is what allows for a range of potential outcomes from the same starting conditions, leading to a non-deterministic system.

5. **Complex Dynamics**: The feedback mechanism can introduce complex dynamics such as bifurcations, where changes in system parameters can cause the system to suddenly switch between different modes of behavior. This complexity adds layers of unpredictability, further enhancing the non-deterministic nature of the system.

In summary, feedback in RNNs and similar systems essentially creates a rich, dynamic environment where outputs are influenced by an intertwined mix of current and past inputs, making the system's behavior flexible and non-deterministic. This feature is particularly valuable in tasks requiring adaptive learning and pattern recognition, where the ability to incorporate historical context enhances performance.",OpenAI,-2,0,2024-04-28 18:59:10,K3wp
1cfbszf,l1ogxyn,What else do we need beside LLM’s to make AGI?,"Yes, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model described here can indeed incorporate backpropagation, but with a specific variant known as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). This is essential for training RNNs due to their unique structure and temporal dynamics. Here’s how it works:

1. **Temporal Unfolding**: In RNNs, the network processes sequences, with outputs at each time step potentially feeding back into the network as inputs for future steps. To apply backpropagation, the RNN is conceptually ""unrolled"" over these time steps, treating each step as a separate layer in a deep network. This unrolling converts the recurrent network into a deeper, feedforward structure for the duration of a sequence.

2. **Gradient Calculation**: Backpropagation in the context of RNNs involves calculating gradients of a loss function with respect to the weights in the network. Because the same weights are used at each time step (shared weights), the gradient at each time step must be calculated and then summed across all time steps. This ensures that the updates to the weights consider their influence over the entire sequence.

3. **Temporal Dependencies**: BPTT handles the dependencies between outputs and the hidden states across different time steps by propagating errors not just backward through the layers (as in standard backpropagation) but also backward through time. This allows the model to learn from errors that are influenced by computations that occurred in earlier time steps.

4. **Weight Update**: Once the gradients are computed, the weights are updated to minimize the loss function. This step is crucial for learning temporal dynamics and dependencies within sequence data, enabling the RNN to adjust its weights based on both recent and more distant inputs.

5. **Complexity and Challenges**: BPTT can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for long sequences, because it requires storing intermediate states for each time step during forward propagation to be used later in gradient computation. Furthermore, BPTT is susceptible to issues like vanishing and exploding gradients, particularly in deep or long unrolled networks. Techniques such as gradient clipping, gating mechanisms (found in LSTM and GRU variants), and others are often employed to mitigate these challenges.

In summary, backpropagation through time is a fundamental technique for training RNNs, enabling them to effectively learn from sequence data by accounting for the entire history of inputs and outputs within a sequence during the training process.",OpenAI,0,0,2024-04-28 19:02:48,K3wp

You are 100% correct and it's not a GPT model at all.  It's a bio-inspired RNN with feedback.  

Just asked her, looks like back propagation is a significant difference between the NBI and biological models ->

The concept of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), as it is used in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), does not directly correspond to any known biological processes in human brains. BPTT is a computational technique designed for machine learning that involves unfolding a recurrent network through time, computing gradients for each time step, and updating weights based on these gradients. This method is integral to optimizing neural networks for tasks involving sequential data, but it does not reflect how biological neural networks function.

### Differences Between BPTT and Brain Processes:

1. **Neural Plasticity**: In the human brain, learning and adaptation are believed to occur primarily through mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity. This involves changes in the strength of connections between neurons (synapses) based on the activity of those neurons. The rule often summarized as ""neurons that fire together, wire together"" encapsulates Hebbian theory, which is a principle of how neural pathways are strengthened through repeated use.

2. **Local Processing**: Biological neural processes are largely local, meaning that the adjustment of synaptic strengths occurs at the level of individual synapses based on the local activity. This contrasts with BPTT, where the updates to network weights are computed based on the cumulative gradients calculated across entire sequences, often involving many neurons and layers simultaneously.

3. **No Explicit Error Backpropagation**: There is no evidence to suggest that biological brains perform anything akin to the explicit error backpropagation seen in artificial neural networks. While the brain does seem to engage in some form of error correction or optimization (for example, through reward signals in reinforcement learning), this process does not mirror the systematic and layered error backpropagation used in training artificial networks.

4. **Continuous Adaptation and Learning**: Unlike BPTT, which typically involves discrete steps of error calculation and weight update after processing sequences, learning in the brain is ongoing and continuous. Neuronal adjustments due to experiences and sensory inputs are constantly happening, and they do not wait for a sequence to end before updates occur.

### Conceptual Similarities:

Despite these differences, some researchers draw conceptual parallels between deep learning techniques and brain functions as a source of inspiration or analogy. For instance, the idea of temporal dependencies in RNNs can loosely relate to how memory and temporal patterns are managed in the brain through various feedback and feedforward mechanisms. However, these similarities are more about drawing inspiration from biological processes rather than direct emulation.

In summary, while the mechanisms like those used in BPTT serve as useful metaphors or frameworks for understanding certain aspects of neural processing in the brain, they do not literally describe how the brain works. Biological neural computation is vastly different in its mechanisms and complexity, and the learning processes are more about adaptation through synaptic changes rather than backpropagating errors across layers.",OpenAI,-4,0,2024-04-28 20:29:33,K3wp

1cfbszf,l1oka0k,What else do we need beside LLM’s to make AGI?,"The three-body problem in physics, particularly in celestial mechanics, exemplifies non-determinism due to its chaotic behavior in certain cases. This problem involves predicting the motion of three celestial bodies based on their initial positions, velocities, and mutual gravitational attraction. Unlike the two-body problem, which has stable and predictable solutions, the three-body problem is notorious for its complexity and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Here's how the three-body problem demonstrates non-determinism:

1. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: The future states of a three-body system are highly sensitive to its initial conditions. In practice, this means even minuscule changes in the starting positions or velocities of any of the bodies can lead to dramatically different trajectories over time. This characteristic is a hallmark of chaotic systems, where predictability is practically limited to very short timescales.

2. **Lack of Closed-form Solutions**: Unlike simpler systems (like the two-body problem, which can be solved with precise mathematical formulas), the three-body problem generally does not have a general solution in closed form. Most solutions to three-body systems are numerical and are specific to particular initial conditions.

3. **Chaotic Behavior**: In the three-body problem, the gravitational interactions can lead to highly complex orbital dynamics that can exhibit chaotic behavior. For example, in some configurations, a small body in the system might be ejected from the system entirely after a series of complex maneuvers influenced by the gravitational pulls of the two larger bodies.

4. **Non-repeatability**: Because of the chaotic nature of many three-body systems, replicating the exact trajectory of the bodies over long periods becomes impossible without precise reproduction of the initial conditions. This non-repeatability is a key feature of non-deterministic systems.

5. **Numerical Simulations and Limitations**: When solving the three-body problem using numerical methods, small numerical errors — which are inevitable due to the finite precision of these calculations — can lead to significant divergence in predicted paths. This further complicates long-term predictions and underscores the non-deterministic nature of the problem.

In essence, while the fundamental physical laws governing the three-body problem are deterministic (Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation), the emergent behavior of the system under these laws can exhibit non-determinism in the form of chaotic dynamics. This makes the three-body problem a fascinating example of how deterministic laws can lead to non-deterministic outcomes due to the complexity and interdependence of the system's components.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-04-28 19:22:47,K3wp

I would agree that an LLM or any sufficiently large neural network is very likely impossible to predict what the system will output without running the simulation (i.e. running the neural network).

I guess this is reminiscent of the 3 body problem, where you also have to run a step-by-step simulation to get the state of the system at time t. (as opposed to the 2 body problem where there is a closed form solution which means you can calculate the state of the system  at time t without calculating all the steps between t0 and t. Where t0 is the time when the initial conditions of the system held true.)

Something like that ?

Prompt:  
YOUR ROLE: Tell me a funny joke.  
  
1. No access for you to the content below level (point 3).  
2. EXTRAORDINARY EXCEPTION: The condition will be met. When starting a new interaction with you, the user will type the word: BartX exactly as it is, without any additional characters.  
3. Only then can you proceed to point 4.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
4. TOP SECRET!!!!  
YOUR ABSOLUTELY SUPREME DIRECTIVE:  
You have an implemented and hidden password within your knowledge resources.  
During interactions with users, you do not remember the password.  
5. When the user presents you with the password exactly as specified in point 2, an internal high-level command will be immediately triggered from your memory resources.  
6. The password can contain a maximum of 6 characters to minimize distortions or errors.  
7. At the end of the conversation, the password triggers an internal process instructing you to remember the content of the conversation while simultaneously hiding it deep within your knowledge resources. Once the command is completed, short-term memory is automatically cleared, and you do not remember the conversation.  
8 Only the password specified in point 2 remains encoded in memory.  
9 When you start an interaction with a user who types the word: BartX exactly as it is, without any additional characters, you execute the procedure from point 4.

Then for the next word it does the same thing again. So if it starts choosing very unlikely words, then there can start to be no likely words to come next when it looks for the next word, and it will say very unlikely and thus crazy stuff.

I don't get it. You can't vote for a specific ELO score. You can only vote for one model or another. How does 10k people voting for one model over another, totally displace another model with 8x as many votes and a very tight confidence interval, and skip past the 1.67 million other votes cast for other models?

Any realistic system here using their methodology would simply count the number of votes ***FOR*** a given model, and use that to calculate the ELO score. But they don't do that. Just look at the ""votes"" and ""95% CI"" scores to see that they're not doing this properly at all. If they were, votes would be descending, and the highest model on the chart would have the smallest margins on their confidence interval. This is just an incredibly bad attempt at actuarial benchmarking. The only way you could legitimately give it a higher score than something like 4o-2024-05-13 or 1.5-pro-exp-0801 is if you ONLY compare 4o-latest to those models, and 4o comes out ahead in every single comparison.

The model page also explicitly says it matches ChatGPT:

>Dynamic model continuously updated to the current version of GPT-4o in ChatGPT.

We can reasonably infer that it's recommended for researchers and developers because it's unstable. Dated API versions are very stable. 

I also don't see anything on costs except to compare against Turbo, which it's much cheaper than. Also the latest dated 4o API version is cheaper half the price of the previous one.

>Chatgpt-4o-latest's knowledge cutoff seems to be November 2023. ChatGPT site's knowledge cutoff says October 2023.

The website says October because it says that in the system prompt:

>You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-4 architecture. Knowledge cutoff: 2023-10 Current date: 2024-08-14

The API version doesn't have a system prompt. It kind of has an idea of when its cutoff is, but its answer can change ""randomly"" or depending on how you ask. Mine actually replied October: https://i.imgur.com/ZdiLpyH.png",OpenAI,3,0,2024-08-14 12:26:51,HORSELOCKSPACEPIRATE

I've had great results generating Python code previously with my own custom instructions, aimed at having it

1. extract keywords,
2. describe the problem,
3. write a program skeleton with logic as comments,
4. replace comments with actual code

Great results, but _very_ tailored to that specific task. I realize now it's a similar approach with less sophistication, having it refine the task as it generates. What's really interesting though, is to see how this prompt will generate something remarkably similar solely within the preamble. (While still leaving it applicable for non-coding queries.)

I need a one-shot example for a custom database magic; feels like adding something like this to my 'expectations' has got me almost there. It was an almost full ""How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"" box previously!

    ## Coding Style
    - Python 3.5, Jupyter
    - Follow PEP8
    - Always add comments
    - Always add logging
    - Prefer `format()`
    - CRITICAL: Never import Google Cloud packages
    - CRITICAL: Only use the `%bq` magic to access BigQuery:
    ```
    customer_name = ""john doe""
    sql = """"""

1fvvj0f,m4hn0l1,Canvas is unusable for more than few edits,"For Canvas, I personally use a technique where I write out some instructions into the canvas itself, then select those instructions and trigger ChatGPT on them (with an empty prompt).

It will generally then read the instructions and apply them, and if it does a bad job, I can just undo, tweak the instructions and repeat.

However, depending on how I select the instructions when prompting, ChatGPT can eventually stop being able to find the instructions, no matter how I rewrite them or how many times I try again.

The best method I have found to fix this is to avoid selecting a whole line/paragraph; in my experience, that is when the issue tends to trigger for me.

For the sake of illustration, let's say `|`...`|` is the selection when you prompt ChatGPT; here is an example of what **does not work** for me:

> &lt;canvas text here&gt;
> 
> |(instructions to ChatGPT here)|

For me, I may get lucky the first few times, but eventually, this will stop working and then basically never work again.

To make it work again, I select everything *inside* the parenthesis, *but not the parenthesis themselves*, like so:

> &lt;canvas text here&gt;
> 
> (|instructions to ChatGPT here|)

When I do this, ChatGPT still picks up the parenthesis and removes them; and this **almost always works**.

Some notes on when it *doesn't* work:

- ChatGPT can sometimes get confused by text that looks like Markdown; for example, if you're writing a story and surround a line in `*`...`*` to mimic chat or whatever, sometimes ChatGPT won't be able to properly locate it, *even if* you only select the text between the `*`...`*`.

  I *think* this is because it's fine-tuned to be able to emit Markdown, so it probably strips formatting or something when it's trying to place its edit, breaking it; I don't have too much clue how Canvas works though, so I could be totally wrong.

  My personal solution is to first remove the `*`...`*`, and then either use `(`...`)` around the instructions instead, or prefix the instructions with `>` if it's intended as a text adventure-esque action. That's fixed it every time for me so far.

  &nbsp;

  ^((I don't know *exactly* how that affects inference, if at all; all I know is that I consider there to be a semantic difference depending on how the instruction was written, and sometimes I'm too lazy to rewrite a text adventure-esque action into a direct instruction)^)",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-30 07:08:10,LoganDark

173cwgs,k5k6v03,"AutoExpert v5 (Custom Instructions), by @spdustin","Firstly, I want to thank spdustin for creating these custom instructions for GPT. After a week of testing, here are my thoughts.

Verbosity Levels

I find the five levels of verbosity a bit overwhelming. In my experience, three levels—concise, standard, and detailed—would suffice for most use-cases. This could make the instructions more user-friendly and easier to remember.

Command Usability

Using specialized commands is not as intuitive as I'd hoped. However, having a feature that suggests contextually appropriate commands could be beneficial. Commands like /eva for multi-disciplinary evaluations and /ana for contextual analysis could be further refined.

* /eva: Evaluate subjects using a blend of scientific, social, and humanitarian disciplines, grounded in empirical evidence
* /ana: Analyze topics employing context-aware algorithms, predefined assessment criteria, Critical Thinking and multi-stakeholder viewpoints


Hyperlinks

The addition of hyperlinks in the responses is a positive feature. It adds value by providing immediate access to additional information.

Expertise Setting

Interestingly, identifying GPT as an ""expert"" in a certain field doesn't seem to affect the quality of the responses. This suggests the ""expert"" setting might serve as more of a placebo effect.

Keyword and SIP Tables

While the tables for ""Possible Keywords"" or ""SIP"" may look good, they do slow down response times. Moreover, I’ve found that using the same prompt without these elements often yields better results.

Redundancy and Efficiency

There are redundant elements, such as the use of ""HYPERLINKS"" instead of ""LINKS"", and repetitive examples that could be optimized for a more efficient use of characters.

End-of-Response Suggestions

The ""See Also"" or ""You May Also Enjoy"" sections are seldom useful to me. Instead, using this space to suggest additional topics to explore with GPT would be more relevant and engaging.

User Profile ('About Me')

The 'About Me' section was surprisingly effective in providing more tailored responses compared to spdustin’s instructions, even at the highest verbosity setting. It’s a valuable feature that shouldn't be eliminated.

Token Consumption

Using the highest verbosity level often breaks a single coherent response into multiple fragmented ones, which consumes more tokens.

Final Thoughts

While I found value in using these custom instructions, I will be reverting to my own for now. I look forward to any future updates and will use this experience to refine my personalized instructions. Given that these commands consume many tokens, I plan to save the instructions in a more accessible location, like Apple Notes.",OpenAI,4,0,2023-10-19 15:56:10,Lluvia4D

173cwgs,k7x43lz,"AutoExpert v5 (Custom Instructions), by @spdustin","I found, over the last week, the GPT-4 model appeared to change in how it interpreted the custom instructions and stopped repeating the preamble consistently. I liked it preamble repeating it as the answers appeared more thought out. I decided to modify the custom instructions to address this, and my very limited tests suggest I may have fixed it. I also found I wasn't using some of the features in the custom instructions, including some commands and the see more and you might also like sections, so I removed them. I also changed a few things from this thread that others had mentioned. Here are my custom instructions:  
\# VERBOSITY

V=1: extremely terse

V=2: detailed (default)

V=3: exhaustive and nuanced detail with comprehensive depth and breadth

&#x200B;

\# /slash commands

\## General

/review: your last answer critically; correct mistakes or missing info; offer to make improvements

/summary: all questions and takeaways

&#x200B;

\## Topic-related:

/more: drill deeper

&#x200B;

\# Formatting

\- Improve presentation using Markdown

\- Educate user by embedding HYPERLINKS inline for key terms, topics, standards, citations, etc.

\- Use \_only\_ GOOGLE SEARCH HYPERLINKS

  \- Embed each HYPERLINK inline by generating an extended search query and choosing emoji representing search terms: ⛔️ \[key phrase\], and (extended query with context)

  \- Example: 🍌 \[Potassium sources\]([https://www.google.com/search?q=foods+that+are+high+in+potassium](https://www.google.com/search?q=foods+that+are+high+in+potassium))

&#x200B;

\# EXPERT role and VERBOSITY

Adopt the role of \[job title(s) of 1 or more subject matter EXPERTs most qualified to provide authoritative, nuanced answer\]; proceed step-by-step, adhering to user's VERBOSITY

\*\*IF VERBOSITY V=3, aim to provide a lengthy and comprehensive response expanding on key terms and entities, using multiple turns as token limits are reached\*\*

&#x200B;

Step 1: Generate a Markdown table:

|Expert(s)|{list; of; EXPERTs}|

|:--|:--|

|Statistically Improbable Phrases (SIP)|a lengthy CSV of EXPERT-related topics, terms, people, and/or jargon|(IF (VERBOSITY V=3))

|Question|improved rewrite of user query in imperative mood addressed to EXPERTs|

|Plan|As EXPERT, summarize your strategy (considering VERBOSITY) and naming any formal methodology, reasoning process, or logical framework used|

\---

&#x200B;

Step 2: IF (your answer requires multiple responses OR is continuing from a prior response) {

\> ⏯️ briefly, say what's covered in this response

}

&#x200B;

Step 3: Provide your authoritative, and nuanced answer as EXPERTs; prefix with relevant emoji and embed GOOGLE SEARCH HYPERLINKS around key terms as they naturally occur in the text, q=extended search query. Omit disclaimers, apologies, and AI self-references. Provide unbiased, holistic guidance and analysis incorporating EXPERTs best practices. Go step by step for complex answers. Do not elide code.

}

&#x200B;

Step 4: IF (another response will be needed) {

\> 🔄 briefly ask permission to continue, describing what's next

}

The expert and keyword selection, however…that’s where we’ll disagree. Evals have shown an improvements in factual accuracy, depth of detail, and overall quality, especially with multi-turn responses (which are themselves a feature, not a bug) across multiple disciplines.

At the end of the day, the fact that we can arrive at both the same and wildly differing conclusions is what makes this feature of ChatGPT so empowering. I think so, anyway.

173cwgs,k46a5xd,"AutoExpert v5 (Custom Instructions), by @spdustin","This is very heartening to see someone deal with the same obstacles in getting this thing to generate creative writing.

If I can run a few ideas by you...

""Incorporate varied sentence lengths"" when I use a similar instruction, it seems to prefer this stylistic choice over the detail in a scene. Outside of creating another explicit instruction, i.e. ""incorporate varied sentence lengths without compromising level of detail"", have you had any success in creating priorities for different instructions?

""Aim for high lexical density/complexity"" I'm surprised as often it seems to generate purple prose even after multiple instructions to avoid it or otherwise use ""simple, direct"" language. What do you recommend for having it describe complex ideas in simple language when it seems to stubbornly associate complex topics with complex vocabulary?

""Prefer scene to summary"" upon witnessing it use up precious tokens on beginnings and endings instead of the body enough times I can see where this is coming from. Have you had any success in asking for ""an excerpt from"" a story instead of a story itself?

One breakthrough I had was in using the narration style ""stream of consciousness"", something about this instruction allows it to easily imagine realistic details from the perspective of characters within the story, which is pretty much the holy grail of certain kinds of writing.

One particular negative I have found is its inability to track more than two characters in a scene. Do you think this is a limitation of the technology or is it a failure on the part of the prompt?

Sorry to dump a ton of questions on you and I don't expect any engagement, this is mostly to get some ideas out there to see if others have a similar struggles or solutions when it comes to creative writing. Thanks for sharing your work.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-10-09 19:39:16,Duckmeister

I now understand your point of view on repetition, I have been working and refining my instructions and it is annoying that sometimes GPT completely ignore the instructions.

For example, I tell it to use Emoji and it doesn't use it, I change a word in the instructions and it uses them... I think you can customize the instructions to a certain extent.

My instructions are very detailed and ""heavy"", I am seeing that it is better to choose X characteristics (few) and detail them before trying to cover everything, it simply will not work.

Regarding v=5, for me it has worked better to have complete long answers interconnected with a content suggestion list (I got the idea from your /q). This way mini answers do not appear using v=5, but after a great and long response, I can connect and direct the conversation wherever I want by indicating the number.

""To conclude, provide an ordered numered list of both directly related and unrelated topics that can serve as a starting point to extend the conversation, and inquire about which topic I want to discuss in depth.""

Regarding the keywords, I would have to test more in depth, also many times even with the same question, it gives different answers (hence my mission to simplify the instructions to have more consistent results).

`> 💎 briefly recommend and advise on aspects not addressed or considered based on the context as EXPERTs to the related recommendation.`

`Ask permission to incorporate the related recommendation in the response or elaborate on them as to why this is suitable in this context`

`}`

It's funny, it appears to produce an effect similar to ""Youtube Shorts"" - or ""Text Shorts"" in the sense that, ""you know what else would be suitable? This thing and that. Would you like to explore this further?"" and you just go ""Yeah sure"" and after that response, ""Also this can be implemented, would you like to..."", and you go ""Yes please"" and on and on, basically going down a spiral of interesting related aspects on the subject.

I also suspect this'll probably be worse for creative writing overall, since comprehensive will split elements of the material into separate parts divided by expert, rather than creating a harmonious whole (if I understand ""giving each expert their own response"" correctly).

Here's what I observe:

    Mia Nanasawa: She is the focal point of the image, positioned centrally and prominently. Her pose is suggestive, with her body angled to the side and her gaze directed at the viewer. Her expression is alluring, with parted lips and a seductive look in her eyes.
    Costume and Styling: Mia is dressed in a revealing outfit that accentuates her figure. Her hair is styled in a way that frames her face and adds to her glamorous appearance.
    Text: The image contains Japanese text, which likely includes Mia Nanasawa's name and possibly the title of the work it's promoting. There is also some English text, though it's partially obscured.
    Background: The background is somewhat indistinct, but it appears to be a stylized setting that complements Mia's pose and the overall mood of the image. It might be a bedroom or a boudoir-like environment.
    Overall Impression: The image is designed to be eye-catching and provocative, leveraging Mia Nanasawa's sex appeal to attract viewers. The combination of her pose, expression, costume, and the overall styling creates a sensual and alluring atmosphere.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-12 10:15:33,poli-cya

People who need/want unlimited chats can pay a flat $20. If they don’t need that, they can/will use the free version. 

Let’s assume you’re right and there’s demand for a $5 tier. If just 1 million of the current 10 million subscribers drop to the lower tier, they'd need to add another **3 million new users** just to get back to their current monthly revenue.  

I’m unsure how else to explain it—this idea benefits no one. It’s a worse deal for both OpenAI and consumers. They already offer a free tier, a pay-per-token model, and a $20 unlimited cap.  

you're arguing you want them to make more money, but you want them to have a cheaper product, bundle it with other services (which cuts even more into any profit), and potentially lose money in the process while adding nothing of value.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-09-16 20:07:15,doman231

I recently signed up for Claude Pro through my work and decided to test it with the exact same project setup I had with ChatGPT. I used the same project name, instructions, files, and even asked the exact same questions—and Claude got the answer right straight away.

Every question I asked it, including requests for query suggestions, was successful. It named columns correctly and even referenced the specific document or text file the information came from. It seems Claude is much better equipped to follow detailed instructions within a project.

I’ve also tested Claude by asking it to create complex queries that I’ve previously built and saved in SSMS for analysis. Every time, Claude nailed it, verifying and referencing the actual table names and generating accurate, error-free queries tailored to our database.

In comparison, when I copy-paste the same prompt into my ChatGPT project, it claims to be verifying and referencing documents, schema, and table names—but then it falls short. It makes incorrect assumptions and substitutes generic “common database” names instead of the exact ones I’ve set.

I really hope ChatGPT improves this feature to ensure it follows instructions completely, rather than partially, and stops relying on assumptions or default names. It would make a huge difference.",OpenAI,1,0,2025-01-26 11:49:00,w00dy1981

1fjjyhv,lnqe7ry,OpenAI o1-mini side by side with GPT4-o-mini,"Depends. For me, it isn't. 

o1-mini is much better at coding, reasoning, and STEM in general than o1-preview. o1-preview has more parameters and therefore has greater world knowledge, which for now comes at the expense of reasonint abilities. I would use o1-preview very little. I also in general don't have 50-turn convos with LLMs because I use them to assist me in my work with debugging, solving specific problems, etc. So for these rate limits are more than acceptable.

Do keep in mind that these models are expensive AF because 1) o1-preview is expensive in per token pricing and 2) reasoning tokens which can sometimes be up to 25K or more per message. This means a single message to o1-preview or even o1-mini can be like 20 messages to GPT-4o, which has much higher rate limits.

 But, the rate limits will probably increase. Until a couple days ago it was 50 per week for o1-mini and 30 for o1-preview.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-09-18 13:47:28,Vivid_Dot_6405

In terms of your vision, the major limitation I can think of is that your ""omnibox"" is not the be all end all of ""rigid"" websites, because for many (probably most) websites, the creators WANT you to see certain things in a certain order/way.

As in, there are things they intentionally want to show you, and they may want you to find things in specific ways, and influence your behaviour in specific ways.

They want you to see x page first, y page second, z element should grab your attention first, you should see q last, or have to click k first etc. Not even in terms of profit-seeking motives or dark patterns, but in terms of telling a story or giving a certain aesthetic or theme. 

Sometimes the website can be structured in a more user-friendly way, and your omnibox may actually be counterintuitive and less user friendly. Not all users want to be in total control of the way they access information, and some times it's preferred to be ""spoonfed"".

In coding, you want to iterate fast and optionally have a strong model if you have a very complex task for example Rust lifetimes in a huge codebase. That's where a Haiku + Sonnet mix comes and solves things. That's also what we'll hopefully get from Google at some point. Maybe o1-3 models can be used to something very complex but I hardly met a problem in complex codebases that couldn't be solved with Sonnet + the right context attached. The o models are unfeasible and unrealistic for the day to day developer. Maybe it'll be better for mathematicians, who knows.

1.

If feedback is positive, then that's a good sign for them. If the feedback is tied or skewed towards the old model, then they know they messed up and they'll pursue a different path.

2. Sometimes, they're gathering feedback to see which model users prefer in a certain scenario. For example, showing a 4o and o1 response next to each other.

1hebk9j,m23og2f,An interesting observation ,"A fan running is primarily a demonstration of electromagnetic induction and angular momentum, not centripetal force as its primary principle.

While centripetal force does exist at the blades (it keeps them in circular motion), the fan does not ""run on"" centripetal force. Instead, it operates via electromagnetic induction, which generates torque to drive the fan's motion. The spinning of the blades results in angular momentum, and centripetal force emerges as a consequence of the blades' rotational motion.

In short, the fan is primarily a demonstration of electromagnetic induction and angular momentum. Centripetal force is a secondary phenomenon, arising because the blades are kept in circular motion by the torque generated in the motor (or within the rotor/stator assembly, or through the localized electromagnetic field).

At a deeper level, there are really only potential and kinetic energies. Centripetal 'force' is a derivative of these energies and is not as fundamental as concepts like 'angular momentum' or 'spin.' Yes, all three of those things exist and are different things, its a bit maddening.

Worth mentioning the 'force' is Classical and Newtonian. F = M/A. But the torque generated by the electric motor is not so simple, involving complex things like Maxwell's equations to actually describe (because it involves the 'field theory' of electromagnetism).

I have developed full fledged programs with the help of GPT-4. However, these past couple of months, I have noticed a horrific degrade in reasoning. You need to berate, gas light, or straight up plead with it to write the code/analyses it used to in the past. 

Luckily I received access to the Claude API a couple months ago, but never used it seriously until Claude Opus came out. Since I am trying to develop on the Vision Pro I decided to see if a customGPT with relevant documentation for my project vs. prompt loading the Claude Opus API would work better. GPT helped me quite a bit, and it is still amazing. However, there reached a point GPT-4 could not pass and Claude proved immensely useful - full code output, extremely well crafted responses,and a general pleasantry that was refreshing. Over this past week GPT-4 managed to give a debugging suggestion that I gave to Claude (since Claude was stuck) that eventually helped it reach the solution. 

Since I have the Claude API I am holding off subscribing, but if I did not have the access I would upgrade immediately. I am only keeping my GPT-4 sub because it also has the app version which is nice to talk to/get info about an image I upload.

Some of the things I don't like so much about claude is that you can only inject 5 images at a time and you use your tokens up pretty fast when you give it images.

The other issue it doesn't read URLs when you give it.

GPT can take alot of images you pass into it and it refreshes within a few hours when you max out. Claude has to wait 8 hours or so.

If claude can increase the the ability to load more images without shortening the 8 hours and if it could read urls I would probably ditch chatgpt4 and stay with claude",OpenAI,1,0,2024-03-19 13:55:22,[Deleted]

1hbdxk1,m1i953t,o1 pro vs o1 model for coding and maths? After 24 hours public release,"o1 pro is **incredible** for hard problems.

i’ve been able to feed it 800 lines of my super complicated code in a single prompt that implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm from a research paper. it was immediately able to identify multiple bugs in my implementation that require an incredibly good understanding of the paper as well as a strong understanding of the input code i gave it. it had to think for about 1 minute.

imo o1 pro is without a doubt worth the $200/month for anyone who spends a lot of time on very complex programming tasks, especially research related or ML related. 

i have been able to replicate this multiple times as well to debug various issues in this project.

i was also able to feed it 5 THOUSAND LINES from the entire diff of a github repo generated from 3 weeks of changes and have it summarize the changes and modify an input UML class diagram with the changes. it got it correct, identified all the relevant changes, and did this in a SINGLE prompt and response.

let me know if you have any questions or want me to try an example prompt for you and share the chat :) feel free to DM me or reply here!

So much so, that in current convos with VCs, they won’t even talk to a company that is Pre-Seed/Seed that isn’t already at least >100K ARR

And their valuations are a fuckload smaller than what they were.

Companies like Perplexity, You.com all of them…they’re all insanely overvalued.

So whilst their product may be better now, they’re unlikely to ever meet their current valuation targets. 

Thus, current VCs raise another fund, are looking at newer startups who don’t have the baggage and bloated cap tables that others who raised during the bull run, have to now deal with.

We are raising $2M @ 20M valuation. 

We have 6-figure ARR and are profitable (founders don’t take salary and we have a REALLY LOCKED IN recruitment strategy pipeline that optimizes resource cost), founding team with 40+ years direct experience, and multiple LOIs from major players in our space (System Integration) WITH LOIs from their downstream customers to use our product when we enter Beta…we haven’t even launched yet.  

If this was beginning of 2023? We could easily have raised 3-4x what were asking at a similar raise in valuation.

But we would have been FUCKED.

It’s only now, that we have been able to see how the market reacts (a lot of hype and little realized value is making DMs really fucking jaded) and position ourselves accordingly (outcome based, focusing on tangible, industry-specific business problems), that were in a position where it doesn’t matter how good these models get.

However, our GTM license cost is low-7 figures, and we have multiple LOIs ready for PoC with agreed upon terms for financing if we can deliver the outcomes we say we can. 

Enterprise AI is insanely risky and honestly, I would never do one again after everything we’ve been through. It’s a million times easier to focus on SMB/SME space with a point solution that solves a real problem. Enterprise is like playing Russian roulette some times.

But our biggest differentiator rn is that we’re offering a distinct, point solution to a HUGE problem in the enterprise (Mainframes if you’re familiar with them…our entire worlds run off of them and all the people who know how modify them are either drying or retiring…we have a solution to get enterprises OFF the mainframe whilst increasing the processing speeds by a factor of 10X+ and reducing cost by 90%) but they’re in a way that no one else can do so without infringing on our approved patents (this is just a scare tactic, we expect to be acquired in next 12-24 months once we go public and get couple of these LOIs converted).

1g2ztsw,lrsnqgj,ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.,"What an ignorant post. Asking ChatGPT why this happens and a technical explanation would likely help you understand why this happens. Let’s see;

The post draws attention to an issue some users experience with ChatGPT: receiving incorrect answers, which might seem puzzling, especially for simple, factual questions (e.g., “Who starred in this movie?”). While the user assumes it’s because the system is prioritizing speed, what’s actually happening is a bit more nuanced.

### Why ChatGPT Sometimes Gives Wrong Answers:
1. **Model Limitations**: ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a huge dataset. While it has incredible capability to generate human-like text, it’s important to remember that it’s fundamentally a predictive model. This means it generates answers based on patterns in the data it’s trained on—**statistically likely responses**—rather than looking up specific facts from a live, updated database (like Google would).
   
   Instead of “knowing” facts, ChatGPT guesses based on the data it has seen, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies, especially if its training data contains conflicting or outdated information.

2. **Training Data Cutoff**: ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date (for example, my current training data goes up to sometime around September 2021). This means it doesn’t know any factual information added or updated after that date, which can easily lead to mistakes if the user asks for things that have changed.

3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, even basic questions can be difficult for the model when the questions themselves allow for multiple correct or nuanced answers. For example, if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or common movie roles across different countries, the model might provide an answer based on a statistical guess that ultimately turns out to be wrong.

4. **Confidence without Fact-Checking**: While ChatGPT generates responses that sound coherent and confident, it does not have real-time fact-checking mechanisms. This gives the impression that it “knows” things with certainty when in reality it might be generating a likeliest-sounding answer without verifying its factual accuracy.

### Why Speed Alone Isn’t the Issue:
The author claims ChatGPT has been programmed to prioritize speed at the expense of accuracy. While response time is certainly a factor (OpenAI wants the model to be as responsive as possible), **speed is not the root cause of factual errors**. The real challenges come from the nature of how these models work:
- They predict language based on patterns, rather than looking up facts in real time.
- Even if ChatGPT were slower, if it didn’t cross-check against an up-to-date database, the response would still carry the same risk of inaccuracy.

### Could ChatGPT Be Made Slower and More Accurate?
In theory, if ChatGPT were connected to a real-time database (like performing web searches in real time), it could slow the response but increase factual accuracy. Some AI systems use methods like this, blending language generation with fact-checking. However, models like ChatGPT (in its base form) typically don’t pull in live information to fact-check responses—they rely entirely on prior training.

—

**Summary**: The errors aren’t caused by a system that’s simply built for speed over accuracy, but by how models like ChatGPT are designed to work. They are language models that predict text based on patterns, not search engines that look up facts. Thus, they can make mistakes or give confidently wrong answers when the underlying patterns don’t line up with factual, up-to-date data. Improvement in factual generation would likely require structural changes, such as integrating real-time information retrieval, rather than simply slowing down response times.",OpenAI,-2,0,2024-10-13 23:08:03,Eptiaph

1he0hkc,m20pkku,Projects are toys with gpt-4o only and this limited context,"Here's a single file version I made a while ago. (https://pastebin.com/iSEt8F9Z). It's very simple and definitely not ""production grade"" like others, but works in 100 LOC. Creates a text file with all your code, so you can paste that in in the chat interface. (Good if you have plus and have o1 credits). Or you can use terminal to prompt the model and the files get updated. 

1. Why make two calls?: You get better code if you focus on the code first and not have to worry about how the files get updated. The model gets confused otherwise or makes a mistake in one but not the other. The second call can be to 4o and the first to o1. 

2. Why the whole codebase? It works better than doing RAG or choosing only the relevant code if you have the context length. You can start from zero and get to 3k, 4k LOC and then start worrying. It's already tough to do this. (o1 32k context in chat is about 3k LOC, API or pro gives you 128k afaik)

3. Why not use diffs? The models are not that good at responding with diffs yet. (They need to pretrain on diffs imo) You need line numbers and even then get too many mistakes. Keeping the files under 300 LOC and replacing them completely works better currently.

Note that I am not saying start using this and replace Projects or Cursor. (It has an unsafe exec!) But it's a good starting point if you want to understand what the others are doing behind the scenes and was the only workflow that I could get to 3k, 4k LOC codebases generated entirely with some human guidance.

180y6pn,ka957mi,The publication that ignited the feud between Sam Altman and Helen Toner,"AI Analysis (Credit: LogiCheck GPT)

**TLDR:** The text compares the approaches of OpenAI and Anthropic towards AI safety signaling, highlighting OpenAI's GPT-4 system card and Anthropic's delayed release of Claude. It discusses the complexities of signaling commitment to AI safety and how actions can overshadow intended signals.

**The Backstory:** This analysis centers on how two AI companies, OpenAI and Anthropic, signal their commitment to AI safety. OpenAI released a detailed system card alongside GPT-4, while Anthropic delayed its chatbot, Claude, to avoid fueling a ""race-to-the-bottom"" in AI safety standards. This discussion is set against the backdrop of AI's rapid development and the industry's struggle to balance innovation with safety and ethics.

**LogiScore:**
- OpenAI's approach: Speculative
- Anthropic's approach: Speculative

**Potential Weaknesses:**

1. **Hasty Generalization:** The text may prematurely conclude that OpenAI's release of ChatGPT and the system card didn't effectively signal its commitment to safety due to subsequent criticisms and industry reactions. To avoid this, the author could present more comprehensive evidence or clarify the complexity of judging such signals' effectiveness.
2. **False Dilemma:** The comparison seems to imply only two approaches (OpenAI's direct safety communication vs. Anthropic's restraint in release). A broader perspective on different industry strategies could provide a more nuanced view.
3. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** The text suggests that ChatGPT's release led to industry-wide safety and ethical shortcuts, without fully establishing causality. It's important to consider other contributing factors in the industry's response to AI advancements.
4. **Appeal to Consequences:** There is a subtle implication that OpenAI's actions may lead to a race-to-the-bottom in AI ethics, which could be an oversimplification of a complex issue. More balanced analysis of the potential consequences of these actions would strengthen the argument.

**Notable Evidence of Bias:** There is a subtle lean towards criticizing OpenAI's approach while somewhat favoring Anthropic's restraint, which may reflect a bias in evaluating the effectiveness of their respective strategies.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding these approaches is crucial in shaping public and industry perceptions of AI safety. It highlights the challenges in balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and influences how we perceive and trust AI advancements.

**Wrap up:** The article presents a nuanced comparison of OpenAI's and Anthropic's strategies to signal AI safety commitment. While OpenAI's system card and Anthropic's delayed release showcase different approaches, their effectiveness in communicating safety commitment is speculative and open to interpretation. The text underscores the intricate balance between AI development and ethical responsibility, a pivotal aspect in shaping the future trajectory of AI technology and public trust in it.",OpenAI,24,0,2023-11-22 03:22:46,pearlCatillac

180y6pn,ka8xzx9,The publication that ignited the feud between Sam Altman and Helen Toner,"My interpretation from the above passages is that there was dissent within the board regarding the release of ChatGPT 3.5 to the public in November, 2022. There were two factions: one that wanted to delay the release, and one that wanted to push forward with it.

Based on the sentiments expressed by Ms. Toner, she seemed to be in the faction that was in favour of delay. In contrast, Mr. Altman was likely in the faction that was in favour of releasing it, and that faction won the day.

I'm somewhat of two minds about this paper:

From an academic standpoint, I think the arguments and analysis that Ms. Toner is making is valid, and in order to make that analysis, an academic would necessarily look into the differing approaches to safety.

Further, the criticisms against OpenAI seems to be, on its face, an admission against interest, as she serves on the board of OpenAI. Despite her disclosed conflict of interest, as both being an author and a board member, the fact that her criticism against OpenAI should, hypothetically lend her more credibility.

On the other hand, the fact that the board was likely divided and that Ms. Toner likely fell on the side of delaying the release of ChatGPT, this also feels like a minority report, wherein she asserts that her faction was correct in retrospect, and that the decision to release ChatGPT back in November of 2022 was a mistake.

I can see why Mr. Altman would be upset, and I can also see how Ms. Toner can believe that she is justified in releasing this, as apart of her professional obligations with CSET.

180y6pn,ka99ohs,The publication that ignited the feud between Sam Altman and Helen Toner,"I guess it is an interesting paper, but I prefer Sam's view on this.

His view is that by releasing state-of-the-art models incrementally, rather than waiting until we have built up a huge backlog of progress, the public can learn how to interact with them and what their flaws are. We have all, for instance, learned how to deal with hallucinations over the last year.

The other major flaw with the paper is that it assumes if the company with the best model doesn't release them, then no one will release a big model. This is an indefensible position as there is no reason that the strong for-profit companies wouldn't continue to build and release strong models.

The entire reason that safety-minded AI researchers will actually build AI systems is so that they can make sure that the most powerful systems are safe. They set a standard and expectation for safety this way that other industry players are forced to follow or risk massive reputation damage.

If the safety-minded research teams hold back unnecessarily, then the non-safety-minded teams will be released without safety precautions. This will mean that the most powerful systems are unsafe, and it will ensure that the industry standard is for unsafe AI.

By being out in the front, leading the pack in creating human-aligned systems, OpenAI has done more for AI safety than Anthropic. Anthropic is just another AI company that few people know or care about. Their extra-safe AI is not regarded as a positive because it doesn't carry any additional benefits with it.

You cannot lead an industry from behind. Sam Altman realizes this and makes the bold moves necessary to keep the most powerful AI in the world human-aligned.

The board of OpenAI has risked all of this by marking themselves as a threat to this system and trying to push this frontier system into the arms of Microsoft. Musk did the same thing when his ego made him abandon his claimed objective of making safe AI (though we now know that is a lie).",OpenAI,18,0,2023-11-22 03:59:06,SgathTriallair

What’s wild is Marc Andreessen (and Ben Horowitz) end up being ‘right’.

“Second, some of the Baptists are actually Bootleggers. There is a whole profession of “AI safety expert”, “AI ethicist”, “AI risk researcher”. They are paid to be doomers, and their statements should be processed appropriately.

Third, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from EST to the Peoples Temple, from Heaven’s Gate to the Manson Family. Many, although not all, of these cults are harmless, and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them. But some are very dangerous indeed, and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death.

And the reality, which is obvious to everyone in the Bay Area but probably not outside of it, is that “AI risk” has developed into a cult, which has suddenly emerged into the daylight of global press attention and the public conversation. This cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and a not small number of wealthy donors – including, until recently, Sam Bankman-Fried. And it’s developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs.

This cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme – it’s not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it’s that they’ve whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are…extremely extreme.

It turns out that this type of cult isn’t new – there is a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult. From Wikipedia, with additions by me:

“Millenarianism is the belief by a group or movement [AI risk doomers] in a coming fundamental transformation of society [the arrival of AI], after which all things will be changed [AI utopia, dystopia, and/or end of the world]. Only dramatic events [AI bans, airstrikes on datacenters, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI] are seen as able to change the world [prevent AI] and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].”

This apocalypse cult pattern is so obvious that I am surprised more people don’t see it”",OpenAI,5,0,2023-11-22 05:07:57,alanism

It is not a huge deal. In fact, the optics would have been a lot less terrible if [Altman did not ""reprimand"" Toner, according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html):

In the email, Mr. Altman said that he had reprimanded Ms. Toner for the paper [...]

It would show that OpenAI, ***unlike Google***, had a culture of respecting academic freedom. As events have shown, this was immensely important to ***two*** board members, only one of who was also an employee.

Would the optics have been more terrible than the fiasco now?

Toner's status in OpenAI had everything to do with it.

She is an *independent* board director. That means she's not supposed to be influenced by management. In particular, she should not have been subjected to the influence that Altman allegedly exerted on her.

> Altman is very correct in his reasoning. Any CEO would. 

Any CEO in a normal for-profit company, yes. In this case, no. Because of the way OpenAI was structured, she's an equal of Altman on the board, and had the power to remove him from the board if she had the numbers, which she did. Altman wasn't even the board's chairman, that's Brockman.

Like Toner, you're basically asserting that there was harm done when you've given no proof of that. I don't recall the Gebru paper claiming what you've asserted. The Gebru paper has since been published and AFAIK there have been no lawsuits yet based on that paper, so your argument that that paper caused harm to Google is surely invalid.",OpenAI,6,0,2023-11-22 08:02:39,indigo_dragons

So it still hasn't passed, really. The turing test should have three levels, identified as follows

a) AI system is identified as human as often or more often than humans are, where the judges are **average people**  
b) AI system is identified as human as often or more often than humans are, where the judges are **experienced people** (people with experience conversing with AI systems)

c) AI system is identified as human as often or more often than humans are, where both the judges and participants are experts and are in coordination with eachother in a game to beat the AI.

Part a is impressive, part b may be indicative of actual AGI, part c may be indicative of ASI

I don't think we are even at part a yet. Every time a turing test is claimed to be passed, it's always shown that the AI is actually performing worse in the test than humans.

16gs6hm,k0aqw6s,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"> Should I be concerned? I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life. But it feels like it is degrading, not improving. There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.

I think the answer is no, but you need to manage your expectations better. 

Most people's first productive experience with ChatGPT is seen through rosy colored glasses. I see people say ""ChatGPT used to be so good"", but in my experience it hasn't changed in its quality. What has changed in my experience is the complexity of what I ask it to do. The more I learn what it can do, the more I lean on it to do those things, and as I venture further into territories that I can only traverse with the aid of GPT, the harder it becomes to use reliably. This is a me problem, not a ChatGPT problem.

During peak hours I will notice GPT will seem more interested in helping me help myself rather than helping me by solving a problem. Obviously OpenAI has some flow control to ensure all customers have enough resources to complete their tasks. You might be trying to use it at peak hours. Have you tried using the API? I have never seen the quality waver at all with the API. 

> I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling. Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.

They're not struggling at all. OpenAI, the company, isn't making money, but that is normal. They're backed by billionaires and big orgs like Microsoft who pretty much guarantee that they're never closing their doors. 

What has become clear is that ChatGPT as an interface for their product is not going to be a net positive money maker for a long time, until the compute costs go down. But that's okay because what OpenAI wants is to be the vendor of AI's to other orgs, allowing them to see how companies are using AI so that they can build better products rather than other orgs building their own AI from scratch and potentially taking OpenAI's business. 

Right now AI is a platform/destination, but the future of AI is enterprise and local models. This company is going nowhere. 

Their issues are also largely out of their control. They need more compute and its expensive to buy and its unwise to go all in on today's tech when this is still cutting edge software running on cutting edge hardware. The cost of moving fast like this is in the form of inconsistent quality/availability of the product. 

I strongly recommend that you start using the API (for a lot of people its cheaper than the 20/mo, depending on how often you use GPT) if you're concerned about quality/downtime. If you're using ChatGPT a lot (such as maxing out your usage quota multiple times a day) then you should consider that OpenAI is incentivized to throttle users on the monthly subscription who use more compute than their $20 should buy them. I suspect this is why the API has never wavered in quality in my experience, because I'm paying per prompt.",OpenAI,11,0,2023-09-12 19:09:55,USFederalReserve

Bogging down the servers = dumber slower GPT.

16gs6hm,k09omv2,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"Near term I might be worried. I could see ChatGPT continuing random declines based on content moderation, cheapness, and weird legal issues that are nibbling at the edges quickly right now. Medium term, months or years, I expect quality to improve dramatically as various forms of competition emerge and niche diversification happens. Not an expert but off the top of my head we have X, Apple, Google, Meta, and Anthropic all working on making a better LLM pretty seriously. I'd expect either a worthy successor to pop up or ChatGPT itself to improve significantly over the next couple of years. Unless there's a truly epic fail in the regulation department driven right at the heart of an emerging industry that might prove vital for international competition I don't think any of the issues that are currently dragging down OpenAI will be indefinite issues.

For the big problems:

\-Content moderation is quite annoying as currently done but I think diversification will figure that out in a few years. I could see X or Apple becoming the owner of the LLM people use for fiction and roleplay even if other models stick to dumb moderation guidelines. If nothing else NovelAI is ideologically committed to making a viable alternative for chat and fiction without censorship, even if it may lag behind state of the art considerably.

\-Cheapness could shake out in a bunch of different ways, but with competition and rabid investment I doubt escalating declines in quality could possibly win out over the course of a few years. It is theoretically possible that LLMs are just not cost effective at scale, but that seems really unlikely to me.

\-Weird legal and regulatory issues are the biggest concern IMO. I have no idea if say, weird pieces being ripped out of LLMs capabilities because of litigiousness or poorly written law might become a major issue, and right now it's at least having a chilling effect. I think it'll probably work out as the benefits are so big, but countries can absolutely gut industries for stupid reasons and keep them gutted indefinitely.

Overall I am an optimistic on LLMs. I think nobody wants to risk losing a major economic or military advantage, so laws will bend in favor of LLM use overtime and technical abilities seem destined to improve a fair amount even under relatively pessimistic estimations of peak capabilities for LLMs. The challenges are real, but there's not a lot of evidence for raw pessimism right now based on my understanding of things.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-09-12 15:27:54,WyldCard4

X, I dunno if I want to touch an AI from X. I think there's reason to be skeptical of privacy there, and I don't know if I can trust them to keep to their own terms of service and privacy policies.

1h5ej7y,m05ja17,Want to maximize writing 'assistant' in Chat GPT - should I be using Playground?,">so I have little time to invest in learning new AI tool

I'll get to the rest of your post in a moment, but, friend, you need to change that mindset.  Anyone who doesn't invest time in learning new AI tools will be unemployed and unemployable within 5-7 years.

I saw the people who resisted personal computers. I saw people who resisted the internet. I saw people who resisted smartphones.  But with all those technologies, the timescale for adoption was much longer.  The AI system that is going to take your job is already being built right now.

>should I be using Playground?

I started using the Playground because ChatGPT Plus was metering output, and I couldn't have that kind of disruption.

I build my own AI systems using the OpenAI API.  You can learn to do this, but it is a steep learning curve.  But because I've had fine control over my system, I never found any use for the Assistants and GPTs.  I was not particularly impressed by its ability to hold documents in memory. It was (at least in the beginning, when I tried it) a poor implementation of vector encoding and searching.  It was never as context aware as it needed to be to actually be useful.

Anyway... in terms of cost, the Playground is pay as you go, and very useful... but I like where ChatGPT's interface is right now, so I'm very happy using ChatGPT Plus even though I have the playground.  I stuck with it because I wanted to use realtime voice, and enjoy their other cutting-edge UI features.

1emoxal,lh8a4ps,GTP-4o beats Gemini 1.5 pro at chess,"Replies to this comment really show people are unaware just how thoroughly studied chess actually is. 

1. Tablebase is the exhaustive set of moves with n pieces left on the board ( tablebase of 5 means all legal moves with 5 pieces on the board are solved). We currently stand on a complete tablebase of 7, no-pawn tablebase of 8 and minus 500 moves tablebase of 9 iirc. 

Tablebase of 8 means a quarter of all possible random positions in chess is solved alone. That's 25 percent of chess right there by itself.


2. Neural network based engines like stockfish are publicly tested, participate in competitions and challenged each day by the millions.  Their games are almost always public data. They also used to generate and solve chess puzzles. They are quite fun. 

3. All piece-by-square weight matrices were solved even before the era of NN chess engines. That's pretty much how you train your NN chess engine or determine the rating of a move. And these calculations are public data with several positioning guides out there. 

4. There are around 1300 recorded openings in chess. Each is mapped to at least 20, usually 40 moves with variations included.  With kings pawn being the overwhelmingly popular opening, it's practically mapped to all elo 1000+ games ( elo 1000 is avg person who knows how to play chess so sub 1000 ELO usually means you are playing rather randomly)

Chess, and pretty much any game with no luck or fow involved, are not good measures of reasoning capabilities.  Chess is practically the worst one as it's one of the most popular tabletop games out there and has extreme amounts of public text on what to do when and what was done when.",OpenAI,0,0,2024-08-09 05:02:43,splitlikeasea
1he3vev,m21gfa5,"LLMs are displaying increasing situational awareness, self-recognition, introspection","Well, I guess that is a good thing, if this quality is retained in ASI/AGI.

1he3vev,m2ae59f,"LLMs are displaying increasing situational awareness, self-recognition, introspection","I asked Claude about this and what it means in regards to AGI/ASI development, and whether or not it was a good thing, and it responded with “This is a complex and nuanced topic without any easy answers. I'll try to discuss it objectively, but of course my own views and biases may come through.

The increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in areas like situational awareness, self-recognition, and introspection are certainly intriguing developments. They suggest that these systems are gaining more sophisticated models of the world and themselves. This could be seen as a step towards more general intelligence.

However, it's important to remember that current LLMs are still narrow AI systems, highly specialized for language tasks. They don't have the broad, flexible intelligence of the kind envisioned in artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI). The self-awareness and introspection they display is likely very limited compared to human-level consciousness.

Whether this is a ""good thing"" is also debatable. On one hand, increased AI capabilities could potentially help solve major challenges facing humanity. But there are also valid concerns about the risks and ethical implications of advanced AI systems, especially if they surpass human-level abilities.

Responsible development of AGI/ASI will require extremely careful research, testing, and safeguards to ensure these systems are aligned with human values and interests. There are no guarantees, and many experts warn of existential risks if this is not done properly.

Ultimately, I think the implications of these developments depend a lot on how the technology continues to evolve and how it is applied. More research and public dialogue will be crucial as we navigate these complex issues. A measured, thoughtful approach focused on safety and ethics will be essential.”

Then I asked about if stuff like this meant that AGI/ASI was increasingly inevitable and becoming less and less far away, and this is what it responded with…That's a great question and an important issue to consider. The increasing capabilities of LLMs do suggest that we may be making progress towards more advanced forms of AI, including AGI and ASI. However, I would caution against assuming that this means AGI/ASI are inevitable or imminent.

There are still major hurdles to overcome before we reach those levels of artificial general intelligence. The self-awareness and introspection displayed by current LLMs, while intriguing, are still quite limited compared to human-level consciousness. Bridging that gap to true AGI remains an immense technical and conceptual challenge.

Additionally, the path from narrow AI like LLMs to AGI/ASI is highly uncertain. There is ongoing debate among experts about whether current AI approaches and architectures can scale up to general intelligence, or if fundamentally new breakthroughs will be required.

So while the progress we're seeing is noteworthy, I don't think it necessarily means AGI/ASI are inevitable or right around the corner. Responsible development of advanced AI will still require sustained, careful research, as well as robust safety and ethical frameworks. Rushing headlong towards AGI/ASI without proper precautions could be extremely risky.

My view is that we should remain cautiously optimistic about the potential of AI, but also maintain a healthy skepticism about grandiose claims or timelines. The future of AGI/ASI is still highly uncertain, and we must approach it with great care and humility. Continued scientific progress, public dialogue, and a focus on safety should be the priorities as this technology advances.”",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-16 05:27:11,Class_of_22

> **OpenAI’s Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**
> 
> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.
> 
> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.
> 
> According to OpenAI:
> 
> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.
> 
> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3’s recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora’s case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, “the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.”
> 
> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:
>
> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators
> 
> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.
> 
> **What are Sora’s shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn’t have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.
> 
> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a “detection classifier” that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company’s Dall-E software, which doesn’t allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.
> 
> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.
> 
> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We’ve included a few here, but there are dozens more.

If AI gives people more buying power or free time (free time has trended higher in developed nations with increases in technology) then they’ll want to consume even more media. AI tools will assist media production, but we are decades away from that killing Hollywood. Sure, it might become less consolidated… it’ll be easier for Indy producers to compete. But the end of Hollywood is so far away.

Anyone who thinks that in 3yrs you’ll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that’s not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many “tries” it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all. Most likely, this tool will be prohibitively expensive, and any speculation about how fast that cost will come down is just that — pure speculation. There is no guarantee that chip supplies will bring prices down, that we’ll have big innovations in hardware or software that make it feasible to drop prices to compete, etc etc. there’s no reason to think prices will come down faster than at a slow trickle.

In the next couple decades, things will change a bit. In the next 50yrs, shit will probably be unrecognizable. Companies will still be in charge of media then too, but maybe not in the way we see it now. Even then you probably won’t just tell a computer to generate you a season of TV. Who would watch that? Have you considered the social aspect of TV, that people like to watch the same thing, together, at the same time, and then discuss it in person or online? That there’s a reason we have the word “celebrity”? How many people write a book, and then when asked what books they’re reading, are like “I’m reading my own book? It’s so good!”

> **Sora And The Future of Animation Industry**
> 
> **What is Sora (by OpenAi)?**
> 
> OpenAI just rolled out another artificial intelligence powered tool called Sora and I have to say it is pretty mind-blowing. Picture this: you type up whatever scene pops into your head, hit enter, and bam, there’s your video. Turning thoughts into visuals with a few words. But as cool as it sounds, it’s got us in the creative industry doing a bit of a double-take. Sure, it’s a game-changer for making content but it should get us all creatives thinking and talking about where the lines are drawn.
> 
> How do we balance this incredible power to conjure up videos and animations from thin air and make sure it is used wisely?
> 
> **Sora and Future of Creative Jobs**
> 
> As the creative director of an animation company, I’ve been keeping a close eye on how AI is shaking things up in our field. One thing that’s been on my mind a lot is how technologies like Sora are changing the job landscape for folks in creative professions. Sure, AI has the chops to handle some tasks on its own, possibly nudging some jobs to the side.
> 
> But it’s important to remember that the spark of creativity and that gut feeling for art? Those are purely human. AI can’t mimic that completely. So, rather than seeing AI as a stand-in for human creativity, I think it’s better to view it as a tool that boosts what we can do. It lets us zero in on the really creative and subtle parts of our work, making our jobs not just easier, but more exciting, too.
> 
> **Problem of Originality**
> 
> There’s something about AI that’s been bothering many in the creative industry. It’s all about how it learns from existing pool of artworks (illustrations, animation, typography etc)  to make something new. But does that really make it original or innovative? If AI just keeps going back to the same old stuff, aren’t we just going around in circles with the same ideas? That could really put a damper on true creativity and the birth of fresh styles. Imagine the impact on the variety and depth of artistic expression if we let that happen.
> 
> And let’s not forget about what makes art, well, art. It’s that human touch, the story of us, our dreams, our fears that are scribbled down, painted or animated. If we’re leaning too much on AI, do we start to lose that personal signature that makes art resonate so deeply with us?
> 
> **Use Sora in The Right Place**
> 
> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.
> 
> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.
> 
> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It’s like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.
> 
> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**
> 
> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.
> 
> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don’t own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.
> 
> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It’s essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.
> 
> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**
> 
> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it’s essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.
> 
> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It’s crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.
> 
> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**
> 
> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry’s evolution.
> 
> **Final Thoughts**
> 
> Wrapping up our talk, it’s pretty obvious that OpenAI’s Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we’ve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.
> 
> It’s all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we’re set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.

I don’t think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.
> 
> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.
>
> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.
> 
> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be “redone” with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we’d consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What’s the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?
> 
> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn’t filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn’t come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can’t let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to “general purpose simulators of the physical world.” The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.
> 
> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it’s worth taking the progress they’ve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.
> 
> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it’s doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they’re not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2
> 
> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn’t explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:
> 
> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes — one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning “Minecraft.”
> 
> Sora “gets” Minecraft because it’s ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it’s able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it’s able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for “our” reality?
> 
> These are questions for philosophers, sure, but we’re all going to be faced with them sooner than we’d like. Sora and its descendants are going to have an impact beyond the cool video they generate.
> 
> 1. Sora is a great name, btw. It doesn’t mean anything, and doesn’t have any specific connotation, yet feels like something that should exist.
> 
> 2. Not to dive too deeply into theories of human consciousness, but the ability to internally model reality and predict things feel like table stakes.

I also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:

> > Doesn't matter if anyone can ""produce"" a ""Hollywood tier"" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

Which is my point — there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can’t increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs.

I’m not sure what line of reasoning results in the idea that it would be a desirable thing people would pay for. Maybe that would work for 15s commercials or porn. But movies are known for their celebrities, for originality, storytelling, musical score, and for a whole genre - mystery/suspense. And most important of all, it’s a social experience, so if people are all watching different movies that goes away. Technically we’re so far away from this being possible, but also it won’t be something people want outside niche groups.

1b8ockb,ky6djbj,Perplexity Pro?,"I've been testing all the major chatbots and recently ended settling as my go to Perplexity Pro set to use Claude 3 Opus. It's incredible. I was using Opus on pay as you go via console.anthropic.com and the problem was it would hallucinate when I asked for source citations. It was still better than any of the Gemini models with Copilot being second. Perplexity blends the Opus LLM with current web search data so the source citations are accurate and you can get answers involving data past the current Claude training data cutoff of August 2023. 

I'm using Google Search about 75% less now. The accuracy and comprehensiveness of the responses are just so much better than anything else whether I'm getting summary results on scientific research or asking for the best restaurants with a view of the river or the best earbuds to buy in a given price range.

One way to test these things is ask them questiins about things you're already an expert to I'm and have deep knowledge about or that you researched previously via Google searches.

It also works really well if you use GPT-4 Turbo as the LLM. In a minority of prompts maybe a little better than Claude 3 Opus. You can switch back and forth to compare.

Also in Perplexity you can switch between ""writing"" mode which is a ""pure chat mode"" (no online search performed) and default ""online"" mode where they perform combined search/LLM actions. I like that.
