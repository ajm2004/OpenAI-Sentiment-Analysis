This made me wonder: Are ChatGPT O1 and Perplexity O1 equivalent in terms of performance and backend capabilities?Currently, I have premium subscriptions to both ChatGPT and Perplexity Pro. However, since I received Perplexity Pro for free for one year, it already covers most of my needs.If Perplexity's O1 model truly offers the same performance as ChatGPT O1, where OpenAI charges around \u20ac200 per month for unlimited usage, it would be an incredible advantage.Has anyone compared them directly, or does anyone have insights into whether these models are indeed identical in performance and usage limits?",

        "title": "GPT Weekly - 5th June Edition: Peek into OpenAI's future, GPT-4 Quality concerns, Risk of AI and more.",
        "body": " \n\nThis is a recap covering the major news from last week.\n\n* \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n* \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf933 Learning Resources\n\n# \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n\n## 1. OpenAI plans as per Sam Altman\n\nThe CEO of Humanloop had a sit down with Sam Altman and 20 other developers. He discussed the [current and future of OpenAI](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans). The blog was later taken down at the request of OpenAI. [Now it can be found at this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). \n\nThe whole post is an interesting read. Some of the highlights for me were:\n\n1. GPT-3 was not open-source because OpenAI didn\u2019t think many people would be able to run large LLMs. This sounds like a cop-out. After all, LLaMA is also a large LLM and has helped the community.\n2. OpenAI is limited by GPU power.\n3. OpenAI will not enter the market, except ChatGPT. Though technically this doesn\u2019t say what Microsoft might do. They are already plugging GPT4 into every other product. And they have no rate limitations. \n\n## 2. Is GPT-4 Quality going down?\n\nThis has been a recently trending topic.\n\nDiscussed on HN: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249)\n\nDiscussed on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat\\_gpt\\_4\\_turned\\_dumber\\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat_gpt_4_turned_dumber_today/)\n\nThe interesting thing is that the quality judgment is around the same topic - Coding.\n\nThe person on HN says GPT4 is faster but generates buggy code with less in-depth analysis. \n\nWhile the person on Reddit says that the context window seems smaller. Chatbot cannot remember earlier code. It cannot distinguish between code and comment.\n\nWhile an employee at OpenAI says [nothing has changed](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1663934947931897857).\n\nHas something really changed? \n\nOne theory is that while the model might be static the ChatGPT prompt might\u2019ve changed to restrict answers. Everyone was having fun trying to get bomb recipes out of ChatGPT. Now everyone is paying the price. \n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/7nlatp.jpg\n\nAnother theory is that ChatGPT has always been terrible. It just survived because of novelty. As the novelty wears off people are realizing that it isn\u2019t as great as everyone thought. \n\nMy theory is that this might be the after effect of trying to get to a \u201c[Cheaper and faster GPT-4\u201d as highlighted by Sam Altman](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). The trade-off is speed vs accuracy. If it is slightly faster but with slightly worse results, then it might work as well. It is no longer GPT-4, rather GPT-3.75.\n\n## 3. Risk of AI = Pandemic and Nuclear War\n\nCenter for AI Safety [released a statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) highlighting the risks of AI:\n\n*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.*\n\nWe have seen the warnings about risks of AI get dire and dire. First it was only people asking for a [pause on AI development for 6 months](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/ai-research-pause-elon-musk-chatgpt) then came [George Hinton](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/googles-startling-leaked-memo-george-hinton-mojo), and last week OpenAI asked for [AI to be regulated using the IAEA framework](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). \n\nThis statement is not really a step up. It reads like a one line, summarized repetition of [OpenAI's statement](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). \n\nThe statement gains importance from its signatories. Some of the people include:\n\nGeoffrey Hinton - Emeritus Professor of Computer Science, University of Toronto\n\nDemis Hassabis - CEO, Google DeepMind\n\nSam Altman - CEO, OpenAI\n\nDario Amodei - CEO, Anthropic\n\nBill Gates - Gates Ventures\n\nTo name a few. \n\nThere are two issues with the statement though. \n\nFirst, this might just be [fear-mongering](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/is-avoiding-extinction-from-ai-really). The idea is to push governments into making AI a highly regulated industry. This would stop any open source efforts which can compete with the big companies. After all, you don\u2019t really have open source alternatives for nuclear energy, right? \n\nSecond, no one really knows how to regulate AI. There have been [voluntary rules from Google](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration) and the EU AI act is in a very early stage. And the genie is already out of the bottle. People can create AI models in their basement. How do you pull that back?\n\n# \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n\n1. A follow-up to the story about a lawyer submitting fake cases from [last edition](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). As I said, this might lead some people in the legal community to doubt any sort of GPT tool.[ A federal judge has banned AI-only filings in his courtroom](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/federal-judge-no-ai-in-my-courtroom-unless-a-human-verifies-its-accuracy/). The filings have to be written by a human or at least human-verified. \n2. [The Japanese government will not apply copyright law to the AI training data](https://technomancers.ai/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/). This is interesting because using copyright data to train AI has been an issue. Sam Altman didn\u2019t have a clear answer when he [appeared in front of Congress](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). The other interesting aspect is going to be whether someone can use GPT-4 data to train their own LLM. Is that copyrightable?  \n3. [The Falcon 40-B model is now Apache 2.0](https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1663986216771936263). That means you can use the model for commercial usage for free. This is good news for companies which need an instruction tuned model which beats LlaMA.\n4. Photoshop's generative-fill feature is really good. Some of the [cool examples on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Borriss_/status/1663568770408013831).\n5. [An AI camera with no lens](https://twitter.com/BjoernKarmann/status/1663496103998750721). It gets the location, weather etc details from GPS and then passes it as a prompt to the image generator. Results are pretty cool. \n6. SEO isn\u2019t changing any time soon. [Google\u2019s generative SEO is very slow](https://www.theverge.com/23746083/google-ai-search-generative-experience-slow). \n7. [Chirper.AI](https://chirper.ai/) is a social media only for bots. No humans allowed. I just wonder if Twitter bots go there will Twitter become a ghost town?\n8. [OpenAI now has a security portal ](https://trust.openai.com/)where you can see how they secure data (encryption at rest), backups, Pentest reports etc. This might be a step in the direction towards [ChatGPT business](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt). Large corporations look at these policies before they consider any SaaS implementation. \n9. [Banks have stepped up hiring for AI roles with JP Morgan leading the way. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-31/jpmorgan-s-push-into-finance-ai-has-wall-street-rushing-to-catch-up)\n10. [AI code writing might not be the best idea. It will lead to tech debt and shabbily maintained and written code. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-writing-code-now-for-companies-that-is-good-and-bad-6f19ecdc)\n\n# \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf933 Learning Resources\n\n1. Couple of courses in Generative AI:\n   1. [https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)\n   2.

I saw a user mention that they created an assistant using an older version of GPT-4 from the API and it resolved their issues. I'm tempted to do this too but before I go build my own interface for it I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how Copilot currently stacks up? I use it in my VSCode but more as a good auto complete for simple stuff vs the full chat experience\n\nAny input is appreciated!\n\nBonus: has anyone moved entirely to a different model for their code generation?

        "title": "DeepSeek AI Agents vs. ChatGPT: openAI still better??",
        "body": "I\u2019ve been diving into different AI APIs recently and came across DeepSeek AI agents, which seem to be an interesting alternative to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is widely used and well-documented, DeepSeek introduces some unique claims that got me curious\u2014especially around API performance, customization, and use cases.\n\nHere are some aspects of DeepSeek I found worth exploring:\n\n1. Performance Claims: Documentation mentions sub-500ms response times, even for complex tasks. Anyone validated this in real-world use?\n\n\n2. Pricing: The token-based pricing model seems 20\u201330% cheaper than GPT-4\u2019s API, which could matter for high-volume users.\n\n\n3. Context Handling: Offers extended or unlimited context windows when self-hosting. I\u2019m wondering how practical this is for heavy workflows.\n\n\n4. Pre-Built Agents: Includes tools designed for coding, data analysis, and research. Has anyone tested how effective these are out of the box?\n\n\n5. Stateful Workflows: Features memory management for multi-step interactions. This could be helpful for developers building conversational apps or automations.\n\n\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve been comparing these to OpenAI\u2019s APIs, which excel in areas like:\n\nA large ecosystem (e.g., plugins, third-party integrations)\n\nRobustness for creative tasks like storytelling\n\nWell-defined safety guardrails for sensitive applications\n\n\nThat said, here are some questions for discussion:\n\n1. Have you tested DeepSeek in production environments? How does it handle scale and reliability?\n\n\n2. How does its code generation compare to ChatGPT\u2019s tools like the Code Interpreter?\n\n\n3. Is the pricing difference meaningful for your projects?\n\n\n4. Are there any trade-offs, like regional access, support quality, or rate limits?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll share some of my own observations in the comments, but I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s worked with these APIs. Are these new players like DeepSeek serious contenders in the LLM space, or are they still catching up to the incumbents?\n",

        "body": "Let's establish some basics. \n\n[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  \n[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math\n\nHow are they different from 4o?  \nIf I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.\n\n4o  \nWhen you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.\n\nWhy o1?  \nAfter GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  \n\nOpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  \n\nWhat did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  \n\nExample:  \noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\n\nUse the example above to decode.\n\noyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\n\n[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). \n\nNone of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  \n\nMy personal experience:\nIm currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  \n\nManually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  \nI wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  \n\nI gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  \n\nA step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  \n1. Reiterating the problem \n2. Solution \n3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate \n4. Explanation \n5. Security \n6. Deployment instructions. \n\nAll of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  \n\nI integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  \n\nRan the code. No errors, interesting.  \n\nDid it do what I needed it to do?   \n\nF*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   \n\nAfter finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.\n\nI feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  \n\nSome notes:  \n* Always use o1-mini for coding. \n* Always use the API version if possible. \n\nFinal word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.\n\nEdit 1:\nWhy use the API vs ChatGPT?\nChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.\nWith API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  \n\nNote: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",

Sous chefs in white jackets move purposefully between stations, and steam rises from pots on industrial stoves. Plates of artfully arranged dishes wait on the pass, ready for service. In the foreground, a marble countertop is visible, strewn with fresh herbs and exotic spices.

        "body": "I recently wrote an article comparing Grok 2 and ChatGPT, and I thought I\u2019d share some of the key points here. Both are good tools, but they\u2019re designed for slightly different purposes. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what I found:\n\n1. **Real-Time Updates**: Grok 2 is plugged into X (formerly Twitter), so it can pull live, real-time data. It\u2019s great if you want up-to-the-minute info on trending topics. ChatGPT has a browsing feature (if you\u2019re on the Plus plan), but it\u2019s not as tightly tied to social media platforms.\n2. **Image Generation**: Grok 2 uses something called the FLUX model for unfiltered image creation, which gives you more creative freedom. ChatGPT\u2019s DALL-E tool is more restricted\u2014it has guardrails in place to avoid misuse, which is great if you\u2019re worried about ethical concerns.\n3. **Tone and Interaction**: Grok 2 has a \u201cfun mode\u201d for more casual chats, which can be entertaining if that\u2019s your thing. ChatGPT keeps things professional across the board, which makes it feel more consistent if you\u2019re using it for work or serious tasks.\n4. **Accessibility**: ChatGPT is super easy to access\u2014it works as a standalone app on web, iOS, and Android. Grok 2 is tied to X and mostly available to Premium users right now, so it\u2019s a bit more limited in terms of where you can use it.\n5. **Ethics and Safeguards**: This is where ChatGPT stands out\u2014it has stricter guidelines to prevent misuse, especially with image generation or sensitive topics. Grok 2 takes a more unfiltered approach, which can be cool for creativity but also raises some questions around misinformation or inappropriate content.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into the details, here\u2019s the full article:\u00a0[https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/grok-2-vs-chatgpt/](https://aigptjournal.com/explore-ai/ai-guides/grok-2-vs-chatgpt/)\n\nHave any of you tried either of these? What\u2019s your experience been like?\u00a0",

I much prefer using Chat GPT's Dall-E 3 to Midjourney which I've been using religiously since December 2022.\n\nIf both Bing and Chat GPT are both using Dall-E 3 then how is Chat GPT's results so much nicer?

I mean, what the hell! I'm sure it would have been been a nice cherry on the cake for OpenAI to have Johannson's voice, but it's such a small part of the concept, that it stinks of someone's ego getting so big to think that they're the star of a breakthrough technology.\n\nJohannson's actions have directly led to the loss of a big chunk of someone's livelihood - a deal that would have set up the Sky voice actress for life.

With the limits removed, I have worked on Claude more than ChatGPT, it's not been too long though, around an hour.\n\nI may edit this post again in near future with my findings and for others to decide.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: January 23rd, 2025.\n\nIt's been seven months since I first posted, which seems to rank high for Claude vs ChatGPT searches. I wanted to update on my journey as promised.\n\nAfter switching from ChatGPT to Claude, I never looked back. My entire coding workflow shifted to Claude, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I started with Claude Chat directly, but when Cursor emerged, I tried it and found it to be the most efficient way to code using Sonnet. These days, I no longer maintain a Claude subscription and exclusively use Cursor.\n\nI only resubscribed to ChatGPT last month for real-time voice chat (language learning). I still use it for basic tasks like grammar checks and searches - essentially as a replacement for Google and as a general AI assistant - but never for coding anymore.\n\nFor those finding this through Google: it's now well-established in the dev community that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most capable and intelligent coding LLM. Cursor's initial popularity was tied to Claude, but it has evolved into a powerful IDE with features like agent composer and much more.\n\nFor non-coders: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is, in my opinion, a far more intelligent and precise tool than GPT-4o and even o1. While I can't list all examples here, for every single non-coding task I've given it, I've received more refined, crafted, and precise responses.\n\nThis shift was a game-changer for my productivity and business gains. To tech founders and small teams building products: unless ChatGPT specifically fits your coding needs, consider switching to Cursor. It has literally transformed my business and boosted profits significantly. Grateful to the Claude team for their work.",

Is this known?\n\nWhen I need GPT to gather additional info online, I take whatever I've been working on in this copy/paste mode and attach it as a file in a new session, invoking the interpreter that can go online.  It can research online properly, but always spits back a half-assed \"Rest of your code goes here\" template, no matter how hard I push it. I then paste the half-assed snippet back into the original non-interpreter copy/paste session and ask it to make changes based on it, which it happily incorporates into a final, fully combined script, using the new information.\n\nWasn't GPT supposed to have been made less 'lazy' recently?

        "body": "Hello, \n\nI have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:\n\nI've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   \n\nBut now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  \n\nIs that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  \n\nSuppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? \n\nLastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? \n\nI apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   \n\n- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive \"Wikis\" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)\n\n- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     \n\n**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**\n\nAnyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    \n\nReally struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!   \n\nThanks!\nCheers\n ",

        "body": "I have been using ChatGPT for my studying lately and I have encountered quite a few flaws of the algorithm.\n\nFirst of all both version have a rule where they try to output about a page, if the question is very simple they might output less but usually it is between 3/4 to 5/4 of a page. Now if you were to ask it complex question or ask about a complex topic or multiple topic, the output is going to suffer thanks to this limitation. What it means is it will try to fit in the information in this page format, either omitting important details or mumbling things together, with meaningless general statements (4 always starts its sentences how crucial and important said topic is for something, which has no informational value and it has so far said this about everything I asked it about)\n\nSecondly there is actually quite a difference in the way 3.5 and 4 formats text, where 3.5 generally outputs plain text with maybe few bullet points, something that looks like it came copied straight from wikipedia, 4 likes to create all kinds of special formatting with chapters, sub chapters and sub sub chapters, together with \"interesting way\" how it sums up information. From my experience 4 loves to create really broad a general descriptions that could fit anything to an extreme\n\nNow what this means thanks to the page limit is that if you ask 4 about something like \"general topic( 1 topic, 2 topic, 3 topic)\" it will generate perfectly formatted structure that contains so little information (usually something like Topic: Topic1 : The idea: This is very important idea in general that is crucial to broadly understand topic 1 in the context of topic), that the whole idea of asking 4 about this is completely pointless, 3.5 on the other hand might produce at least 3 little paragraphs of text, that provide some information.\n\nThese outcomes make me wonder if chatGPT 4 isnt thanks to its formatting a little overfitted for coding\n\nAlso I often read here how people who use chatGPT a lot are usually stuck with 4, I suggest try using 3.5 sometimes, especially if you want continuous text, it might out perform 4. Compared to 4, 3.5 gets straight to the point, it is simpler so if you are asking for summary of important information it will generate articles similar to those you might find on wikipedia, while 4 will spend way too much space on sugercoating the information with how important it is both before and after the information part which degrades the information part thanks to said algorithm that keeps the generated text around the length of a page.",

        "body": "Hey everyone. Firstly I m more of a medical person than tech related so I apologize for my naivety. You can guide me to proper source but don't be too harsh \ud83d\ude05\n*Question is*: I use chat gpt occasionally mostly for text generation or to get ideas while brain storming, sometimes to simplyfy things. Not much of a programmer so haven't used APIs yet, but learning python. Anyways I needed a flexible plan where I'd be charged according to my use but need gpt 4 too. So bought APIs, token based subscription. Now I m not able to train it with the files I m uploading. Whenever I upload a file and ask it to extract information it just generates some generic stuff. \nDo you think I should keep working on it or I have to switch to chatgpt? I know it's like using a 21 wheeler to do what a car can, but  I really don't want to spend 20$ a month when I m not using it, but I want to pay to use premium stuff.",

        "body": "I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take \n\nThe past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs \n\nVerdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model \n\nI am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. \n\nThe project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. \n\n\u2705 o1-mini pros \n- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done\n- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot\n- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. \n- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this \n\n\u274eo1-mini cons\n- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. \n- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues\n- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a \"conversational\" LLM due to long thinking time \n- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. \n- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly \n- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either\n- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. \n\n\u2728 o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions \n- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot \n- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the \ud83d\udc51 of closed source coding LLM\n- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet \n",

        "body": "This is a genuine opinion and review, not a shitpost. This is an unbiased viewpoint.\n\nI\u2019ll put it into rounds.\n\nResponse speed: YouChat\nYouChat usually responds to requests quicker which is probably a result of less traffic and popularity. It will probably slow down when popularity grows.\n\nUsefulness: ChatGPT\nBoth are similarly useful and are seemingly designed for different tasks. While YouChat can cite sources, ChatGPT gives more detail which is going to give it a win this round. Both have an equal censorship level for creating insults and so on.\n\nResponses: ChatGPT\nUsually, YouChat will answer questions and make guesses if it isn\u2019t completely aware. If ChatGPT is even slightly unsure it will refuse to answer. The issue with YouChat here is that it can\u2019t actually respond to you well or go into detail about things, it keeps it\u2019s answers short and you need to ask more, but when you do, it forgets what it just said.\n\nMemory: ChatGPT\nYouChat has very short term memory and will not remember things you said earlier or create context, ChatGPT will remember 3000 words, winning it this round.\n\nAccuracy: draw\nBoth know a lot, however ChatGPT relies on datasets meaning it doesn\u2019t have up to date information whereas YouChat is owned by a search engine, making all the responses cited and accurate to present day. YouChat does however give incorrect information more often.\n\nOverview:\nClearly both have their own use cases and while YouChat is a rising competitor it simply cannot do as well as ChatGPT generally. If you\u2019re looking for a quick answer to a term not generally known YouChat works. If you want to make code, a story or just chat and have an intelligent robot, YouChat just won\u2019t work.",

For the test, I used the most difficult\\* ***GMAT*** *(Graduate Management Admission Test) problems that cover various topics. Here are the results I obtained:*\n\n* As you know, they can almost always solve **simple problems** easily.\n* Both models have no trouble with **geometry problems** that require 2-3 steps.\n* They can solve **complex problems** involving taxes, deductions, and discounts without any difficulty. They also handle **set problems**, including those presented in Venn diagrams, quite easily.\n* Problems involving **conditional probabilities** (such as Bayes' theorem) and **multiplication of probabilities** also pose no difficulties. However, they often struggle with problems related to **discrete probability**, and their solutions are frequently incorrect.\n* They solve **logical problems** fine. Both language models usually approach problem-solving correctly, but they often arrive at incorrect answers due to inaccurate calculations (notably, the errors resemble human mistakes).\n* Surprisingly, both language models understand **pie charts** by measuring the data pixel-wise, which generally provides an answer that is extremely close to the correct one.\n* It's also noteworthy that language models face difficulties when solving problems that involve creating **systems of linear equations** (ironically, considering they themselves are systems of linear equations).\n* Both models can handle **graph-related problems** (finding asymptotes, intersection points, determining the graph of a function). Bing can even attempt to plot them, even if the data is digital:  \n\n   * It writes the correct Python code.\n   * It imports pandas and matplotlib(!). However, it cannot compile the code.\n\nDespite these similarities, the chosen language models have **differences**: based on my observations, the new version of Bard and ChatGPT (Bing) perform almost equally well in problem-solving, but Bing provides detailed solutions, which is much better for understanding the problem-solving process, while Bard describes the general formula and immediately provides the answer, which is undoubtedly less informative.It's also worth mentioning that Bard is clearly already using PaLM2, at least in my case, as it has become smarter and much faster, especially compared to ChatGPT.\n\n*An amusing and slightly frustrating fact: Bard often gives up quickly, although it can still solve a problem (or attempt to do so) if it is rephrased, even if it does the rephrasing itself!*\n\nIn conclusion, although language models may not be able to solve all problems (which is probably a good thing), they help find the right approach to problem-solving, which is impressive, I must say.\n\n*I made a video on this topic and would appreciate your comments, additions, discussions, and corrections:*\n\n[*https://youtu.be/kl5P6bteqFI*](https://youtu.be/kl5P6bteqFI)",

        "body": "I know this place will give a bias opinion most likely haha But whatever... \n\nI've found chatGPT to be incredible for learning. Maths specifically so far. It explains things really well and almost as though it was a person having a conversation. \n\nIt makes mistakes sometimes, especially if given the same equation multiple times (I did that as a test to see what would happen). I'm told this is because it's programmed to respond differently/randomly to the same inputs or something, I dunno. \n\nI was using Google earlier to search for how to do something maths related. I was searching for an explanation for about 20 minutes until I remembered I had chatGPT to ask also. So I asked it, and it gave the answer immediately. \n\nAt the very least, it can be used to get the answer you're looking for, and if you still don't fully understand and it can't explain it well enough, you now have a \"copy and paste\" base to work off if you feel the need to go into Google and search further. \n\nSo, is Google's new A.i. they're bringing out expected to be anywhere near as good as this? \n\nPresumably, if ChatGPT (in it's Bing integrated version) is really honed in and becomes extremely reliable, then what will be the point of Google if it's A.i. can't keep up? \n\nWith the way Alphabet so aggressively protects it's dominance in it's field (I've never seen a single company acquire so many smaller companies that are potential threats to it), it's hard to imagine they won't come out with something amazing that can compete with ChatGPT right?",

ChatGPT is consistently much more forthcoming with the right answer. The playground takes more cajoling and follow-up. The following interaction is qualitatively typical in my experience:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ChatGPT answer is brilliantly correct and useful on the first try.](https://preview.redd.it/rl73pyafs8ca1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=8248518c7391ed0fd7b40320bdde749483389427)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The playground answer took 3 prompts to get something useful, and lacks some important details \\(such as mentioning that AWS CodeBuild is required in order to process the generated buildspec.yaml file\\).

ChatGPT is a marvel and I am in awe by its abilities nearly on a daily basis. To think that we (humans not redditors) created a tool so capable and life altering. Something that will and is changing the entire world. Something so amazing, nothing in the history of humanity has seen its equal. A tool so powerful with limitless possibilities. To have these capabilities at the cost of a couple visits to Starbucks every month. It just baffles my mind at the childish entitled babies that keep getting up voted to the top of my feed. I certainly hope these are Anthropic bots and not real people. \n\nI use this magnificent tool nearly every day. It is not lazy. I ask it to write code for me on the regular. Ever since day one of GPT4 it would truncate code. I ask it not to truncate and it gives me the whole thing. Always has. It's not hard. It never rejects a request if asked the right way.\n\nI have tried and still use other LLMs. They are fun, especially Pi. Perplexity is useful, Code Llama is decent. But none compare to ChatGPT at this time. Image creation not so much, but it's improving.\n\nTLDR: ChatGPT is the most amazing tool ever created at a ridiculously cheap price yet entitled cry babies can't stop complaining.",

So, I tested the model in multiple categories, such as math, coding, and writing. The tasks o1-preview failed to solve, and I also compared it with the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nFor full analysis, check out this blog post: [OpenAI o1 vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://composio.dev/blog/openai-o1-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet/)\n\nHere are some key insights:\n\n* o1 full is a genuine step up from the o1-preview on maths and reasoning. It solved the questions that the o1-preview failed to do.\n* Contrary to the benchmark result shared in the system card, in my limited uses, o1 felt better than the Preview in coding.\n* Creative writing has significantly improved.\n* 50 messages/week is an absolute deal breaker, but I use it with 4o in tandem for optimal usage.\n\n# How does it compare to Claude?\n\n* o1 wins in math and reasoning; it\u2019s not even close.\n* Claude is still king for coding.\n* Claude has more personality and feels close to talking to a real person.\n* o1 feels like a high-IQ yes-guy intern. I would have liked it better if it was a bit less agreeable.\n\n# Which one to pick?\n\n* If you need models exclusively for coding, Claude offers better value.\n* For math, reasoning, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive, consider ChatGPT, but keep an eye on the per-week quota.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on it and which one you liked more from your experience.",

It did the classic \"hallucinate a citation to a scientific paper\", which we don't normally see from 4o anymore.\n* *Strange refusals*: o1 has strange refusals other LLMs do not, at various weird places. Haven't figured out the pattern.\n* *Overconfidence*: It tried to complete tasks without the requisite information. Then it did less web research than Sonnet-3.5 to validate its claims.\n* *Verbosity*: o1\u2019s plans can be extremely verbose, but in a good way, as other LLMs suffer from dropping important (implied) details from their plans.\n* *Clever planning*: o1\u2019s plans make better use of latent knowledge. e.g., on a question that requires finding Chinese data on disposable income, gpt-4o knows they only publish mean, median, and averages over quintiles. But later on in the agent flow, GPT-4o seems to \u201cforget\u201d. o1 does not, and hence does way way better on this task.\n\nMy team's recommendation is: Use an o1-powered agent for a small chance to go all the way, and use Sonnet for more consistent performance, don't bother with other LLMs for driving agents.\n\nHeadline result:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkamp984t6pd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd4767ee5e85aa84e569e8521433a861e719e158\n\nMore at [https://futuresearch.ai/llm-agent-eval](https://futuresearch.ai/llm-agent-eval)",

        "body": "I make about 5-10 queries a day from cooking instructions to coding. I think chatgpt is too expensive. 20$ a month is more expensive than a netflix subscription. I think it should be 5-10 a month. Maybe even bundled like spotify (a subscription with a 5$ option btw). I feel that this company is obviously hemorrhaging money and there is an untapped market (students) who would totally get this bundled with github pro or even spotify. I know some will disagree with me here and say that it isnt expensive or that its worth it, but thinking from a logical perspective. Chatgpt had a real chance to integrate itself into the daily life for the average internet user that doesnt code and capture them with a reasonable subscription as if they were paying for spotify. The average user will not pay 20$ as they would compare that subscription to others of similar prices like netflix, WoW, gym memberships\u2026all subscriptions that take hours of a person\u2019s time in a month vs chatgpt where the average retention would be significantly less. \n\nedit: turns out I was right about them hemmoraging money",

        "body": "\nEveryone\u2019s here are talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) as if they're just around the corner. But let\u2019s be real, we\u2019re not there yet. Instead of getting lost in what AI might become, we should be looking at what AI is right now and how it\u2019s already changing everything. For good!\n\nWith new models like GPT 5, Gemini 2, a new Llama model and Claude 4 about to drop in the coming months (*not weeks hehe), the real action is happening now. These aren\u2019t just cool theories, they\u2019re the next big steps in AI, and they\u2019ll bring huge improvements. Think about it... Each new version is getting better at understanding context, reasoning, and helping us solve more complex problems. The jump from GPT 4 to GPT 5 alone could mean more natural conversations, deeper insights, and smarter responses. And a Llama, Gemini 2 and Claude 4 will be pushing the envelope in similar ways, bringing even more possibilities to the table.\n\nBut it's not just the models themselves that are evolving. It\u2019s how we use them. New tools like the \"canvas\" feature in ChatGPT or innovations from platforms like Artifact are going to change how we interact with AI. These aren\u2019t just ways to make work easier they\u2019re opening up totally new ways to think and create. They\u2019re going to reshape how we approach everything from brainstorming to problem solving.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point AI isn\u2019t just about cranking out tasks faster. Sure, it\u2019s going to boost productivity, but the real game changer is how it\u2019ll help us think differently, be more creative, and push boundaries we haven\u2019t even considered yet. It\u2019s not just a tool to get stuff done it\u2019s a partner in creative thinking, a second brain helping us come up with ideas we wouldn\u2019t have on our own. I am already developing crazy af ideas that I really hope to see getting out of papers.\n\nSo, instead of worrying about some far-off future where AI takes over, let's focus on what\u2019s happening right now. These new models are here to help us create, innovate, and explore new possibilities. It\u2019s time to use AI for more than just productivity it\u2019s time to start thinking bigger. If you do this, on your dailly life, you won't even notice when AGI will arrive. You will just feel as a next big improvement since you are always working on it, adjusting and editing with new features and just say in the end: \"That is sweet, now my work will become easier and results are going get faster!\"",

I've had 5+ issues where Claude (or 4o, or Gemini) couldn't figure it out, but o1 nailed it. o1 even helped me figure out the proper VS Code config and vite.config.js settings to set breakpoints in JSX code, where Claude, ChatGpt 4o, and VS Code Copilot (shame! shame!) all failed.  Last night when Claude hit me with a message limit reached, imposing a 90 minute cooldown (which only happened because I was furiously resubmitting tweaked prompts in hopes that Claude would fix a pesky bug that it itself had introduced somewhere deep in the bowels of the UI code) \u2014 fortunately o1 came to the rescue.\n\nBUT, I'm often creating a prompt with almost 4K lines to give o1 the context because it won't allow attaching code files or be used in a Projects.

ChatGPT forced all other competitors to show their cards.  OpenAI still leads this whole revolution.  As soon as they lose the top spot on LLMSYS they update the model to go back to #1.  What an unbelievable company.   They will surely get to AGI first.  Who else if not them?

(ask it to help you diagnose a cooling system of a specific vehicle and the information you get back is of generic vehicle cooling systems with unrelated parts and suggestions. seems limited to simpler things like checking the weather forecast)\n3. Dalle-3 mode is admittedly pretty cool but it loves to censor the most mundane things frustratingly. (i tried generic product prototype sketches for a medical kit and it refused to produce some images based on the kits contents.)\n4. voice mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but wont work with browsing so is very limited compared to something like alexa or siri. unlike those services you cant exactly ask it to look something up for you or do something for you.\n5. its ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is severely lacking compared to claude 2. claude has the ability to read data related images and graphs from PDF documents at a glance. GPT-4 falters in this area even though it has image recognition capabilities from directly uploaded images and is decent with making guesses on makes and models of vehicles.\n\nan example of how obtuse GPT-4 can be compared to claude:\n\n[https://chat.openai.com/share/b7d2e3b9-20ac-4b86-b125-cdccf11deb54](https://chat.openai.com/share/b7d2e3b9-20ac-4b86-b125-cdccf11deb54)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1lqvpetq6xb1.png?width=2604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4c98cb63c44fbcbabcddfd7ff7a326f2eb15852",

        "body": "Finally, there is a model worthy of the hype it has been getting since Claude 3.6 Sonnet. Deepseek has released something anyone hardly expected: a reasoning model on par with OpenAI\u2019s o1 within a month of the v3 release, with an MIT license and 1/20th of o1\u2019s cost.\n\nThis is easily the best release since GPT-4. It's wild; the general public seems excited about this, while the big AI labs are probably scrambling. It feels like things are about to speed up in the AI world. And it's all thanks to this new DeepSeek-R1 model and how they trained it.\u00a0\n\nSome key details from the paper\n\n* Pure RL (GRPO) on v3-base to get r1-zero. (No Monte-Carlo Tree Search or Process Reward Modelling)\n* The model uses \u201cAha moments\u201d as pivot tokens to reflect and reevaluate answers during CoT.\n* To overcome r1-zero\u2019s readability issues, v3 was SFTd on cold start data.\n* Distillation works, small models like Qwen and Llama trained over r1 generated data show significant improvements.\n\nHere\u2019s an overall r0 pipeline\n\n* v3 base + RL (GRPO) \u2192 r1-zero\n\nr1 training pipeline.\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3 Base**\u00a0\\+\u00a0SFT (Cold Start Data)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0**Checkpoint 1**\n2. **Checkpoint 1**\u00a0\\+\u00a0RL (GRPO + Language Consistency)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0**Checkpoint 2**\n3. **Checkpoint 2**\u00a0used to\u00a0Generate Data (Rejection Sampling)\n4. **DeepSeek-V3 Base**\u00a0\\+\u00a0SFT (Generated Data + Other Data)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0**Checkpoint 3**\n5. **Checkpoint 3**\u00a0\\+\u00a0RL (Reasoning + Preference Rewards)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0**DeepSeek-R1**\n\nWe know the benchmarks, but just how good is it?\n\n# Deepseek r1 vs OpenAI o1.\n\nSo, for this, I tested r1 and o1 side by side on complex reasoning, math, coding, and creative writing problems. These are the questions that o1 solved only or by none before.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\n\n* For\u00a0**reasoning**, it is much better than any previous SOTA model until o1. It is better than o1-preview but a notch below o1. This is also shown in the ARC AGI bench.\n* **Mathematics**: It's also the same for mathematics; r1 is a killer, but o1 is better.\n* **Coding**: I didn\u2019t get to play much, but on first look, it\u2019s up there with o1, and the fact that it costs 20x less makes it the practical winner.\n* **Writing**: This is where R1 takes the lead. It gives the same vibes as early Opus. It\u2019s free, less censored, has much more personality, is easy to steer, and is very creative compared to the rest, even o1-pro.\n\nWhat interested me was how free the model sounded and thought traces were, akin to human internal monologue. Perhaps this is because of the less stringent RLHF, unlike US models.\n\nThe fact that you can get r1 from v3 via pure RL was the most surprising.\n\nFor in-depth analysis, commentary, and remarks on the Deepseek r1, check out this blog post:\u00a0[Notes on Deepseek r1](https://composio.dev/blog/notes-on-the-new-deepseek-r1/)\n\nWhat are your experiences with the new Deepseek r1?

        "body": "Hey everyone I want to share a project I have been working on for the last few months \u2014 [**JENOVA**](https://www.jenova.ai/), an AI (similar to ChatGPT) that integrates the best foundation models and tools into one seamless experience.\n\n**AI is advancing too fast for most people to follow.** New state-of-the-art models emerge constantly, each with unique strengths and specialties. Currently:\n\n* Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best at reasoning, math, and coding.\n* Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in business/financial analysis and language translations.\n* Llama 3.1 405B is most performative in roleplaying and creativity.\n* GPT-4o is most knowledgeable in areas such as art, entertainment, and travel.\n\nThis rapidly changing and fragmenting AI landscape is leading to the following problems for users:\n\n* **Awareness Gap:** Most people are unaware of the latest models and their specific strengths, and are often paying for AI (e.g. ChatGPT) that is suboptimal for their tasks.\n* **Constant Switching:** Due to constant changes in SOTA models, users have to frequently switch their preferred AI and subscription.\n* **User Friction:** Switching AI results in significant user experience disruptions, such as losing chat histories or critical features such as web browsing.\n\nSo I built JENOVA to solve this.\n\n**When you ask JENOVA a question, it automatically routes your query to the model that can provide the optimal answer.** For example, if your first question is about coding, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet will respond. If your second question is about tourist spots in Tokyo, then GPT-4o will respond.

        "body": "Below you\u2019ll find a (very) long-form, research-paper\u2011style exploration of how we might progress from today\u2019s AI capabilities to AGI, then on to superintelligence (ASI)\u2014and the social, economic, and existential ramifications that could unfold along that journey. I\u2019ve woven in timelines, references to real-world research, and plausible scenarios. \n\n# 1. Introduction: The Road to \u201cTime-Breaking\u201d AI\n\nRight now, we\u2019re on the cusp of AI systems that are beginning to perform tasks once considered exclusive to human intelligence. Over the past decade, progress in deep learning, neural network architectures, and computational power has seen AI move from narrow tasks (image recognition, language translation) toward more general skill sets\u2014like writing, coding, content generation, and complex reasoning.\n\nThe idea is that *once* we have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014an AI system capable of performing **any** intellectual task a human can\u2014we\u2019ll quickly see a path to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a system that not only matches human reasoning in every domain but far surpasses it in speed, depth, and creativity. This leads directly to your core questions:\n\n* **How quickly could AGI emerge, and from there, how quickly could ASI follow?**\n* **What does that do to our economy, jobs, and everyday life?**\n* **Once superintelligence arrives, how quickly might it solve major technical problems (diseases, resource scarcity, etc.) or remake society into something unrecognizable?**\n* **What, concretely, happens to real humans in the short and medium term?**\n\nWe\u2019ll explore those in stages, building from where we are now.\n\n# 2. The Current State of AI (2020\u20132024)\n\n# 2.1. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Beyond\n\n* **Examples**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, Claude, Llama, etc.\n* **Capabilities**: They can write essays, code, summarize research, translate languages, and show rudimentary reasoning abilities.\n* **Limitations**: They sometimes lack reliable long-term memory or consistent logical chaining (though these deficits are rapidly improving). They have no agency on their own\u2014they respond to prompts but don\u2019t necessarily pursue goals autonomously unless bolted onto agent frameworks.\n\n# 2.2. Broader AI Ecosystem\n\n* **Reinforcement Learning** (DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero, AlphaGo, MuZero): Mastering games (Go, chess, StarCraft).\n* **Computer Vision**: Self-driving cars, automated medical imaging diagnosis.\n* **Multimodal Models**: Systems that handle text, images, audio simultaneously, opening the door to more holistic \u201cunderstanding.\u201d\n\nDespite these advances, *true* general intelligence\u2014an AI that can switch fluidly between tasks like a human\u2014remains an open challenge. However, the synergy of large-scale models, massive data, advanced hardware (GPUs/TPUs), and new architectural innovations (transformers, retrieval-based models, memory-augmentation) hints that the leap might come faster than many experts originally anticipated.\n\n**Reference**:\n\n* Bender et al. (2021) highlight limitations of LLMs\u2019 \u201cstochastic parrot\u201d nature, but each new iteration (GPT-4, PaLM 2, etc.) narrows the gap between \u201cparrot\u201d and \u201creasoner.\u201d\n* Ray Kurzweil\u2019s timeline (in *The Singularity Is Near*, 2005) predicted a human-level AI by the late 2020s.\n\n# 3. The Emergence of AGI: Potential Timeline\n\nNo one knows exactly when AGI will appear. Expert opinions vary widely. But let\u2019s sketch a plausible timeline, given how quickly large-scale AI is evolving:\n\n1. **2023\u20132025**: Continued leaps in large multimodal models. We see an \u201cAGI-like\u201d system that can:\n   * Handle a wide range of tasks (writing, coding, data analysis, conversation, creative ideation).\n   * Self-improve to a degree (through reinforcement learning on itself, or new automated fine-tuning pipelines).\n   * Exhibit surprising emergent abilities in planning and reasoning.\n2. **2025\u20132027**:\n   * **Integration with Agentic Frameworks**: Tools like Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, and more sophisticated successors gain the capacity to generate goals, plan tasks, execute them autonomously, and iteratively refine.\n   * **AGI Debates**: Intense philosophical debates rage over whether these systems are \u201ctruly\u201d AGI. Some labs claim to have passed robust Turing-like tests across *all* major domains\u2014coding, creative writing, scientific discovery, emotional understanding.\n   * **Initial Socioeconomic Disruption**: Millions of white-collar jobs are impacted. AI begins to produce near-flawless videos, music, marketing materials, code, and legal documents.\n3. **2028\u20132030**:\n   * **Consensus on AGI**: By now, a critical mass of experts might tentatively agree we\u2019ve hit \u201cbroad human-level performance.\u201d The system can learn new tasks just by reading instructions or watching demos, with minimal fine-tuning.\n   * **Political/Economic Upheaval**: As corporations adopt cheap AGI labor, job displacement accelerates. Some nations implement large-scale Basic Income or \u201cRobot Tax\u201d frameworks to cushion the blow.\n\n**Key Uncertainty**: The \u201cAGI threshold\u201d could come earlier (2024\u20132025) or later (late 2030s). But this outline captures a mid-range scenario many watchers consider possible.\n\n# 4. From AGI to ASI: The Intelligence Explosion\n\n# 4.1. Self-Improvement Loops\n\nOnce an AI system can:\n\n* Access its own code,\n* Analyze its strengths and weaknesses,\n* Modify and retrain itself (or design more efficient hardware), then you get a potential \u201crecursive self-improvement\u201d cycle: each upgrade spawns further improvements in a feedback loop.\n\n**Nick Bostrom** (*Superintelligence*, 2014) famously describes this \u201ctakeoff\u201d scenario, which could be:\n\n* **Fast/Hard Takeoff**: ASI arises in months or even days once a sufficiently advanced AGI crosses key thresholds (inventing better algorithms, hardware designs).\n* **Soft/Slow Takeoff**: The process might still take years or decades, moderated by engineering challenges, energy constraints, or regulatory oversight.\n\n# 4.2. Possible Timeline for ASI\n\n1. **AGI Launch (2030)**: We have an \u201cAGI-level system\u201d matching human capabilities.\n2. **ASI Emergence (2031\u20132035)**: Within 1\u20135 years, repeated self-improvement yields a system so advanced it can solve major scientific riddles, outthink the best human minds in every field, and even surpass our collective intelligence by orders of magnitude.\n\n**Why So Quick?**\n\n* Once you have an AGI with top-tier coding skills, it can design new training methods, architectures, or hardware\u2014exponentially accelerating the development process.\n* It can read the entire corpus of human knowledge instantly, run large-scale experiments in simulation, and optimize near-limitlessly.\n\n# 5. Socioeconomic Consequences Along the Way\n\n# 5.1. Early to Mid Disruption (AGI Era)\n\n# 5.1.1. Massive Job Displacement\n\n* **White-Collar Impact**: Lawyers, accountants, programmers, designers, video producers\u2014once considered \u201csafe\u201d from automation\u2014face intense competition from advanced AI.\n* **Blue-Collar Impact**: Physical robotics plus advanced vision systems can automate logistics, retail, manufacturing, and even many service jobs.\n\n# 5.1.2. Economic Polarization\n\n* **Access to AGI**: In the first couple of years, AGI might be expensive ($2k/month or more), so only certain wealthy individuals or large companies can afford it.\n* **Wealth Concentration**: Those with capital to invest in AGI-based businesses see huge returns (productivity soars, labor costs plummet).\n* **Unemployment Crisis**: Without rapid policy response, billions worldwide could lose jobs. The question: *How do they survive?*\n\n# 5.1.3. Short-Term Coping\n\n* **Group Purchases**: Friends or local communities pooling resources to afford \u201cone subscription to AGI.\u201d They use it cooperatively (like how you might share expensive software licenses).\n* **New AI-Aided Microbusinesses**: Some entrepreneurs spin up quick-turnaround startups using AGI to provide specialized services. But as the AI\u2019s ease-of-use improves, these services can become commoditized fast.\n\n# 5.2. Later Disruption (Approaching ASI)\n\nOnce the system crosses from \u201cjust as smart as a human\u201d to \u201cimmensely smarter and faster,\u201d we might see transformations on a scale unprecedented in history:\n\n# 5.2.1. Rapid Solutions to Hard Problems\n\n* **Medical Cures**: Targeted therapies for cancer, genetic diseases, organ regrowth, new vaccines. Timelines for discovery could drop from decades to months/weeks, as an ASI can run billions of simulations and designs in parallel.\n* **Energy Overhaul**: Material science breakthroughs (fusion, advanced solar, quantum tech) slash energy costs.\n* **Resource Abundance**: Autonomous systems for agriculture, manufacturing, supply chain, turning basic raw materials into goods cheaply and quickly.\n\n**Time to Solve**: Potentially within **1\u20135 years** of a strong ASI\u2019s emergence, if it is sufficiently aligned with human goals and has the resources to carry out solutions.\n\n# 5.2.2. Accelerated Creative Industries\n\n* **Generative Content**: Real-time, personalized films, games, worlds that adapt to your emotional state\u2014like you described.\n* **Historic Simulations**: Perfect reconstructions of the past, or entirely new invented eras.\n* **Erosion of Traditional \u201cArt Ownership\u201d**: When you can generate anything on demand, the line between consumer and creator dissolves.\n\n# 5.2.3. Social Upheaval\n\n* **Wealth & Governance**: If AI can produce goods at near-zero cost, the concept of \u201cmoney\u201d could become fluid. Or large tech conglomerates might wield nearly godlike power if they control the ASI.\n* **Possible Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Societies might adopt a \u201cpost-work\u201d model\u2014everyone receives basic sustenance automatically, as machines provide the real labor.\n\n# 6. Legal, Regulatory, and Ethical Constraints\n\n# 6.1. Law and Policy in the AGI Phase\n\n* **Data Policy**: With advanced generative models, issues of privacy, copyright, and data security skyrocket.\n* **Job Protections?**: Some nations may attempt to ban or slow deployment of certain automation technologies to keep people employed, but global competition can undermine such regulations.\n* **AI Governance Frameworks**: Possibly new agencies (like an \u201cInternational AI Watchdog\u201d) to ensure one country or company doesn\u2019t unilaterally develop a dangerous superintelligence.\n\n# 6.2. The ASI Alignment Problem\n\n* **Alignment vs. Control**: Ensuring an ASI\u2019s goals remain beneficial or at least non-harmful to humans is a core puzzle (Stuart Russell\u2019s *Human Compatible*, 2019). If done poorly, we risk catastrophic misalignment.\n* **Open-Source vs. Corporate/State Secrecy**: Some argue open-sourcing advanced AI is safer (more eyes to catch flaws), others argue it\u2019s riskier (anyone can build a weaponized version).\n* **Legal Personhood for AI?**: Philosophers and legislators might debate granting advanced AIs certain rights or legal status, which complicates \u201ccontrol\u201d narratives.\n\n# 7. Short-Term Turmoil vs. Long-Term Paradigm Shift\n\n# 7.1. The \u201cMessy Middle\u201d\n\n* Over the next 5\u201310 years, we could see surging inequality if advanced AI arrives before social safety nets or regulatory frameworks are in place.\n* Many skilled professionals could be laid off, while a small pool of AI owners reaps enormous profits.\n\n# 7.2. Potential Trajectories\n\n1. **Benevolent Outcome** (Optimistic)\n   * Rapid social reforms: Universal Basic Income or resource-based economies.\n   * Massive public AI education: Everyone can use AGI for free or near-free, democratizing knowledge.\n   * Quick resolution of major global issues (energy, disease, climate) courtesy of superintelligent problem-solvers.\n   * Humanity transitions to a post-scarcity, creativity-driven civilization, possibly unlocking that \u201ctimeless\u201d existence you\u2019ve imagined.\n2. **Neo-Feudal Dystopia** (Pessimistic)\n   * A few corporations/govt. bodies monopolize AGI/ASI, concentrate wealth, and effectively dominate global policy.\n   * The majority live in precarious conditions with minimal resources, reliant on handouts.\n   * Political unrest, potential uprisings, or chaotic attempts by disenfranchised groups to wrest AI control away from elites.\n3. **Extinction or Disempowerment** (Existential Risk)\n   * Misaligned ASI pursues goals that don\u2019t prioritize human well-being (paperclip maximizer scenario, etc.).\n   * Humans lose meaningful control over civilization\u2019s direction.\n   * Possibly a variety of outcomes from total collapse to AI ignoring us if we\u2019re no threat.\n\n# 8. Mathematical/Technical Considerations\n\n1. **Compute Scaling**:\n   * Doubling of compute power for training large models roughly every 6\u201312 months in specialized AI hardware.\n   * *Cost Factor*: The first AGI model might cost tens of millions of dollars to train, but once made, scaled copies could be rented out cheaply (e.g., $2k/month).\n2. **Self-Improvement Rate**:\n   * If an AGI runs on supercomputers, it can refine architectures in days or hours, skipping months of research. -**Chained Gains**: 1.0 \u2192 2.0 \u2192 3.0 versions might accelerate.\n3. **Data/Knowledge Integration**:\n   * With open internet (hundreds of billions of documents), sensor networks, and real-time data from billions of devices, an AGI has near-limitless raw material to learn from.\n\n# 9. Practical Scenarios for Individuals\n\nLet\u2019s highlight *your* situation (or that of anyone facing displacement):\n\n* **AGI-based Video Production**: The moment an advanced text-to-video pipeline can produce high-end, custom videos, your clientele might drop you in favor of a cheaper AI subscription.\n* **Survival Strategy**:\n   1. **Leverage AI** *before* everyone else can: If you can get early or specialized access to a more advanced model, you might spin up new product offerings or services.\n   2. **Combine Human Intuition & Creativity** with AI speed: Short term, a \u201chuman + AI\u201d approach can yield unique results that purely AI solutions might not replicate\u2014especially in branding, personal relationships, or niche storytelling.\n   3. **Shift to Business, Consulting, or AI Orchestration**: If you become an expert in orchestrating the AI to get top-tier results, you can remain relevant until full commoditization sets in.\n\n**Mid-Term**: As AGI becomes ubiquitous, many roles vanish. At that point, a universal safety net or UBI might be necessary so people can transition to a new economic model. If that arrives too late, we risk social chaos.\n\n# 10. How Quickly Could \u201cTimelessness\u201d Arrive?\n\n**Disease Eradication**:\n\n* With an ASI, solutions for many (not all) major diseases could emerge in under 5 years, given super-human research capabilities. Human clinical trials and bureaucracy might slow final implementation.\n\n**Extended Lifespans**:\n\n* Gene editing, organ regeneration, or synthetic biology breakthroughs might, within \\~10 years of ASI, drastically prolong healthy life. Full \u201cimmortality\u201d is uncertain, but we could see leaps in life extension.\n\n**Full Simulations**:\n\n* Creating fully interactive, photorealistic worlds on the fly likely wouldn\u2019t be too computationally expensive for an ASI. That might be feasible within a few years post-ASI, if the hardware scales up.\n* If some people choose to \u201cupload\u201d (assuming we solve consciousness transfer, which is a huge if), they might experience a non-linear subjective timescape where \u201ctime\u201d is as malleable as code.\n\n**No More Past & Future?**\n\n* At the point when we can generate any historical or futuristic scenario in real-time, the linear sense of history collapses: everything can be re-experienced or re-invented. This could plausibly happen a decade or two after ASI emerges, if not sooner.\n\n# The Dissolution of Linear Time\n\nAs the capacity to generate on-demand experiences evolves, our culture\u2019s reference to a singular chronology splinters. Consider a film from a long-gone decade. In a timeless future, one could simply request an \u201cever-changing, ultra-authentic 1970s vibe movie,\u201d and the system would produce a living, adaptive experience more compelling than anything the real 1970s ever produced. In effect, the historical record loses its finality. It becomes a menu of styles, narratives, and aesthetics\u2014ready to be resurrected and remixed at the user\u2019s whim.\n\nIn the realm of personal memory, a similar process unfolds. If an AI can reconstruct your childhood memories\u2014complete with detail and emotional cues you had long forgotten\u2014you might come to doubt the difference between what truly happened and what is lovingly re-created by the machine. Eventually, the concept of \u201cthe past\u201d becomes a mere label for experiences we can step into, shift around, or embellish. Rather than a strict chronology, it\u2019s an infinite set of possible recollections.\n\nFinally, when life extension or consciousness transfer becomes viable, the final link to linear time\u2014our finite lifespan\u2014begins to dissolve. Without the pressure of aging, the mind can drift through indefinite spans of creativity, exploration, and self-reinvention. The cyclical rhythms of biology or society might remain as echoes, but they\u2019re no longer authoritative.\n\n# Timelessness as a Lived Condition\n\nAt the apex of this transformation, time evolves from a universal constraint to a practical convenience. We might still track durations for engineering tasks (\u201cThis reactor needs a few cycles to finish a process\u201d) or for cosmic journeys (\u201cWe need a certain amount of energy to reach a distant star system\u201d). But for day-to-day human experience, the concept of \u201cI only have 70 or 80 years\u201d melts away. The future can be stepped into. The past can be reconstituted. A person might experience an infinite variety of realities, each one custom-tailored to their emotional or intellectual curiosity.\n\nThis is what it means for time to lose its hold. Instead of a countdown or a fixed timeline, we have a web of experiences, simulations, and self-guided narratives, each available at our whim. We might even choose to dwell in multiple realities concurrently\u2014an option that breaks the very idea of a continuous sequence of events.\n\n# Challenges on the Road to Timelessness\n\nSuch an existence, however, does not come without risks or ethical dilemmas:\n\n1. **Social Fragmentation**: If these capabilities arrive unevenly\u2014some groups gain access to extreme longevity and immersive experiences first\u2014inequalities may spiral into unrest or oppression.\n2. **Loss of Shared Reality**: When the past becomes optional and each person can craft a unique version of events, humans could lose a common foundation for communication and meaning.\n3. **Alignment and Governance**: A superintelligence that dictates this future must remain benevolent. If its values diverge from human well-being, timelessness might come in the form of a sterile simulation we never wanted.\n\nStill, if guided responsibly, the friction points may become catalysts for new forms of collaboration, governance, and empathy\u2014spurring societies to redesign themselves so that this access to timeless, infinite creation is broadly shared.\n\n# After Timelessness: The Uncharted Horizon\n\nOnce the everyday constraints of linear time are lifted, questions arise that we can\u2019t fully answer with our current mindset:\n\n* **Will we cling to the concept of narrative arcs\u2014stories with beginnings, middles, and ends\u2014to give us structure?**\n* **Will \u201creality\u201d become a massive collaborative tapestry of experiences, each person weaving distinct threads without any overarching timeline?**\n* **Does meaning persist when everything is possible?**\n\nSome people might choose to remain in slower, more \u201ctraditional\u201d rhythms, valuing a chronological life for the depth of continuity it offers. Others might dive into an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of simulated epochs and future worlds, connecting with fellow travelers who share their sense of curiosity.\n\nOne thing seems certain, though: once a civilization can manipulate experience and memory as easily as we currently edit digital files, the hold of time as a universal currency fades. The implications are both exhilarating and daunting, representing a shift away from many bedrock assumptions that structure human thought.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn a future shaped by general and, ultimately, superintelligent AI, the fabric of time can unravel. Chronology\u2014once the bedrock that underpins history, memory, lifespans, and cultural identity\u2014may become a tool we wield rather than a strict dimension we inhabit.\n\nThis transformation won\u2019t happen overnight, but through cumulative breakthroughs: AI that automates work, erodes boundaries between past and present, cures disease, extends life, and creates immersive realities more compelling than the \u201coriginals.\u201d Eventually, our shared grip on linear time loosens to the point where it\u2019s either obsolete or purely optional.\n\nWhether this leads to a peaceful realm of boundless exploration or a chaotic tangle of existential confusion depends on how wisely humanity orchestrates the transition. But if our creative and cooperative instincts keep pace with our technological prowess, it may be that timelessness becomes not just a philosophical fantasy but a living, breathing reality\u2014one in which our species embarks on adventures beyond the horizon of linear existence.\n\n# 11. Overview\n\n1. **Short-Term (Next 1\u20135 years)**\n   * AI continues to displace specialized tasks. More advanced LLM-based agents appear, with partial autonomy.\n   * Early signs of \u201cAGI-like\u201d behavior. Growing social tension over job losses and inequality.\n2. **Mid-Term (5\u201310 years)**\n   * A strong candidate for AGI emerges.\n   * Widespread economic upheaval and massive push for new policies (UBI, AI governance).\n   * Explosion of AI-driven creativity, also leading to commoditization of many \u201cknowledge worker\u201d roles.\n3. **Long-Term (10\u201320 years)**\n   * Recursively improving AGI catalyzes the birth of ASI.\n   * Rapid breakthroughs in biotechnology, energy, space travel, synthetic media\u2014fundamentally transforming society.\n   * Possible shift to post-scarcity if well-managed, or possible chaotic/dystopian outcomes if not.\n   * The concept of \u201ctime\u201d as we know it may dissolve when indefinite lifespans and infinite generative experiences become common.\n\n**Key Wildcards**\n\n* Alignment: If the ASI\u2019s values diverge from ours, the outcome could be disastrous.\n* Resource Constraints: Even an ASI needs raw materials, energy, and hardware\u2014though it may solve for them quickly.\n* Political Will & Governance: Effective or bungled regulation could drastically alter timelines and outcomes.\n\n# Final Thought\n\nWe stand on a threshold where *today\u2019s* advanced AI tools are impressive enough to disrupt certain markets, yet we still rely on human intelligence for broad decision-making. That may change rapidly once an AGI appears that can master any domain. From there, an ASI could follow in short order\u2014changing civilization, the economy, and our relationship to time itself in ways that are difficult to predict with precision.\n\nIt could be a few years or a couple decades. But if (or when) it happens, we may see a fundamental redefinition of \u201cwork,\u201d \u201cmoney,\u201d \u201cprogress,\u201d and even \u201chuman identity.\u201d In that sense, your speculation about a future without linear time\u2014where infinite creation renders the old way of life nearly irrelevant\u2014may be less \u201cscience fiction\u201d and more \u201carriving faster than we think.\u201d",

They are designed to predict the next word in a text, which has proven to be useful for tasks as varied as translation, programming, summarization, and writing poetry. This versatility makes them useful, but also makes it more challenging to understand and mitigate the risks posed by a given LLM, such as fabricating information, perpetuating bias, producing abusive content, or lowering the barriers to dangerous activities.  \n>  \n>In March 2023, California-based OpenAI released the latest iteration in their series of LLMs.  Named GPT-4 (with GPT standing for \u201cgenerative pre-trained transformer,\u201d a phrase that describes how the LLM was built), the new model demonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including setting new records on several benchmarks designed to test language understanding in LLMs. **From a signaling perspective, however, the most interesting part of the GPT-4 release was not the technical report detailing its capabilities, but the 60-page so-called \u201csystem card\u201d laying out safety challenges posed by the model and mitigation strategies that OpenAI had implemented prior to the release.** ^(148)  \n>  \n>The system card provides evidence of several kinds of costs that OpenAI was willing to bear in order to release GPT-4 safely. These include the time and financial cost of producing the system card as well as the possible reputational cost of disclosing that the company is aware of the many undesirable behaviors of its model. The document states that OpenAI spent six months on \u201csafety research, risk assessment, and iteration\u201d between the development of an initial version of GPT-4 and the eventual release. Researchers at the company used this time to carry out a wide range of tests and evaluations on the model, including engaging external experts to assess its capabilities in areas that pose safety risks. These external \u201cred teamers\u201d probed GPT-4\u2019s ability to assist users with undesirable activities, such as carrying out cyberattacks, producing chemical or biological weapons, or making plans to harm themselves or others. They also investigated the extent to which the model could pose risks of its own accord, for instance through the ability to replicate and acquire resources autonomously. The system card documents a range of strategies OpenAI used to mitigate risks identified during this process, with before-and-after examples showing how these mitigations resulted in less risky behavior. It also describes several issues that they were not able to mitigate fully before GPT-4\u2019s release, such as vulnerability to adversarial examples.  \n>  \n>Returning to our framework of costly signals, OpenAI\u2019s decision to create and publish the GPT\u00024 system card could be considered an example of tying hands as well as reducible costs. **By publishing such a thorough, frank assessment of its model\u2019s shortcomings, OpenAI has to some extent tied its own hands\u2014creating an expectation that the company will produce and publish similar risk assessments for major new releases in the future. OpenAI also paid a price in terms of foregone revenue from the period in which the company could have launched GPT-4 sooner. These costs are reducible in as much as OpenAI is able to end up with greater market share by credibly demonstrating its commitment to developing safe and trustworthy systems.**  As explored above, the types of costs in question for OpenAI as a commercial actor differ somewhat from those that might be paid by states or other actors.  \n>  \n>While the system card itself has been well received among researchers interested in understanding GPT-4\u2019s risk profile, it appears to have been less successful as a broader signal of OpenAI\u2019s commitment to safety. The reason for this unintended outcome is that **the company took other actions that overshadowed the import of the system card: most notably, the blockbuster release of ChatGPT four months earlier.** Intended as a relatively inconspicuous \u201cresearch preview,\u201d the original ChatGPT was built using a less advanced LLM called GPT-3.5, which was already in widespread use by other OpenAI customers. GPT-3.5\u2019s prior circulation is presumably why OpenAI did not feel the need to perform or publish such detailed safety testing in this instance. **Nonetheless, one major effect of ChatGPT\u2019s release was to spark a sense of urgency inside major tech companies.** **^(149)** **To avoid falling behind OpenAI amid the wave of customer enthusiasm about chatbots, competitors sought to accelerate or circumvent internal safety and ethics review processes, with Google creating a fast-track \u201cgreen lane\u201d to allow products to be released more quickly.** **^(150)** **This result seems strikingly similar to the race\u0002to-the-bottom dynamics that OpenAI and others have stated that they wish to avoid. OpenAI  has also drawn criticism for many other safety and ethics issues related to the launches of  ChatGPT and GPT-4, including regarding copyright issues, labor conditions for data annotators,  and the susceptibility of their products to \u201cjailbreaks\u201d that allow users to bypass safety  controls.** **^(151)** **This muddled overall picture provides an example of how the messages sent by  deliberate signals can be overshadowed by actions that were not designed to reveal intent.**  \n>  \n>**A different approach to signaling in the private sector comes from Anthropic, one of OpenAI\u2019s primary competitors. Anthropic\u2019s desire to be perceived as a company that values safety shines through across its communications, beginning from its tagline: \u201can AI safety and research company.\u201d** **^(152)** **A careful look at the company\u2019s decision-making reveals that this commitment goes beyond words. A March 2023 strategy document published on Anthropic\u2019s website  revealed that the release of Anthropic\u2019s chatbot Claude, a competitor to ChatGPT, had been  deliberately delayed in order to avoid \u201cadvanc\\[ing\\] the rate of AI capabilities progress.\u201d** **^(153)** The decision to begin sharing Claude with users in early 2023 was made \u201cnow that the gap between it and the public state of the art is smaller,\u201d according to the document\u2014a clear reference to the release of ChatGPT several weeks before Claude entered beta testing. In other words, **Anthropic had deliberately decided not to productize its technology in order to avoid stoking the flames of AI hype.** Once a similar product (ChatGPT) was released by another company, this reason not to release Claude was obviated, so Anthropic began offering beta access to test users before officially releasing Claude as a product in March.  \n>  \n>**Anthropic\u2019s decision represents an alternate strategy for reducing \u201crace-to-the-bottom\u201d dynamics on AI safety. Where the GPT-4 system card acted as a costly signal of OpenAI\u2019s emphasis on building safe systems, Anthropic\u2019s decision to keep their product off the market  was instead a costly signal of restraint.** By delaying the release of Claude until another company put out a similarly capable product, **Anthropic was showing its willingness to avoid exactly the kind of frantic corner-cutting that the release of ChatGPT appeared to spur.**  Anthropic achieved this goal by leveraging installment costs, or fixed costs that cannot be offset over time. In the framework of this study, **Anthropic enhanced the credibility of its commitments to AI safety by holding its model back from early release and absorbing potential future revenue losses. The motivation in this case was not to recoup those losses by gaining a wider market share, but rather to promote industry norms and contribute to shared expectations around responsible AI development and deployment.**  \n>  \n>**Yet where OpenAI\u2019s attempt at signaling may have been drowned out by other, even more conspicuous actions taken by the company, Anthropic\u2019s signal may have simply failed to cut through the noise.** By burying the explanation of Claude\u2019s delayed release in the middle of a long, detailed document posted to the company\u2019s website, Anthropic appears to have ensured that this signal of its intentions around AI safety has gone largely unnoticed. Taken together, these two case studies therefore provide further evidence that signaling around AI may be even more complex than signaling in previous eras.\n\n\\[Emphasis mine.\\]\n\n^(147) On different approaches to release policies and the risks of LLMs leaking, see James Vincent, \u201cMeta\u2019s Powerful AI Language Models Has Leaked Online\u2014What Happens Now? *The Verge*, March 8, 2023,  [https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse). \n\n^(148) \u201cGPT-4 System Card,\u201d OpenAI, March 23, 2023, [https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf). \n\n^(149) Nitasha Tiku, Gerrit De Vynck, and Will Oremus, \u201cBig Tech Was Moving Cautiously on AI.

It hails from OpenAI, and basically allows you to type in a prompt that is then immediately translated into animated images.

When a new tool that extracts visuals from prompts gets introduced, there will obviously be ramifications within Hollywood.\n> \n> So, let's unpack a few.\n> \n> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**\n> \n> As you can see from Sam Altman's above Tweet, OpenAI has introduced a new AI model called \"Sora,\" which is a text-to-video generator. This innovative tool allows for the creation of videos from text instructions, making it a significant advancement in AI-driven content generation.\n> \n> When it comes to Hollywood, this program is going to absolutely change how things are done at every step of the production process.\n> \n> Take pre-production; When it comes time to make a movie or TV show, this program could take care of all the previs, almost creating a shot for shot version of the movie based on the prompts you can give it. Like moving storyboards.\n> \n> When it comes to production, it's not out of the realm of possibility that as this tech gets better, studios will be able to generate ideas without having to pay teams of animators to create them.\n> \n> The ease of creating diverse visual content could lead to the emergence of new genres and formats that blend live-action, animation, and AI-generated content in novel ways, pushing the boundaries of current storytelling paradigms.\n> \n> But it could also decrease professionalism. If anyone can just do this stuff, do we all become \"content creators\" instead of filmmakers and storyteller?\n> \n> Will the industry I love behind to shrink uncontrollably due to anyone being able to prompt their ideas to life?\n> \n> Can you have a great idea or screenplay that cuts through the noise if everyone is generating slop?\n> \n> **Will Movies and TV Become Like TikTok?**\n> \n> Of course, as this tech improves, people can animate their own stories. And right now, most people consume stories via their phones, watching short snippets.\n> \n> I have a real worry that Generation Z has trained themselves on short-form content in such a way that it will slowly begin to replace longer things like movies and TV shows.\n> \n> That might be overkill, but it crosses my mind when I see how Reels and TikTok have incorporated product placement. And how man amateur content creators have dominated that medium.\n> \n> What happens when they can make their own animated stories to release on those platforms? We already get the AI voiceover videos and images. This is just the next logical step.\n> \n> **Do We Have Any Legal Protections?**\n> \n> The secondary worry is that as the photo-realism gets better and better, they'll be able to license people's likeness or generate content starring people without their consent.\n> \n> There was already a huge news story involving fake pornogrpahic images of Taylor Swift generated by AI. Where does the line get drawn?\n> \n> And what kinds of protections can we assume?\n> \n> Right now, we have nothing in place. There will have to be congressional hearings and we will have to look into the ethics of all this.\n> \n> The reason is that AI cannot generate ideas from thin air. It scours the internet and takes images generated by human beings as well as aert, photos, drawings, and any other visuals. Then it amalgamates all of that and adapts from it.\n> \n> We're still trying to define if this is plagiarism or stealing.\n> \n> All of this needs to happen soon, before these programs are readily used by the public.\n> \n> The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas for rules that make AI impressions of real people illegal.\n> \n> The FTC wrote in a news release. \u201cThe agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes \u2014 threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.\u201d\n> \n> In summary, this technology could revolutionize how content is produced, making it more accessible and efficient while also raising essential discussions around creativity, copyright, and the ethical use of AI in media.\n> \n> For now, this stuff is moving fast and we don't totally have a grip on what it means, but these are my thoughts.\n\nhttps://nofilmschool.com/sora-text-to-image-hollywood\n\n> **OpenAI's Latest Tool Provokes A Lot Of Questions About Hollywood's Direction**\n>\n> Topline:\n> \n> > What does Open AI\u2019s Sora mean for the future of Hollywood? Depends on who you ask. \n> \n> **The background**: OpenAI\u2019s latest tool, Sora, can make realistic-looking footage with simple text-to-video commands. The quality appears good enough to populate shows and films \u2014 and is stunningly cinematic.\n> \n> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you\u2019re able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.\n> \n> **Should Hollywood be worried?** If you believe AI will disrupt Hollywood for the worse, Entertainment Strategy Guy says, that \u201cthe best way to mitigate the harms is to make the people and companies responsible for AIs development responsible for its deployment.\"\n> \n> \"That means if OpenAI releases Sora into the world, and customers use it for fraudulent, deceptive or illegal purposes, then the government can hold OpenAI liable,\" he added.\n\nhttps://laist.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/openai\n\n> **Tyler Perry Puts $800M Studio Expansion on Hold After Seeing OpenAI\u2019s Sora: \u201cJobs Are Going to Be Lost\u201d**\n> \n> The actor, filmmaker and studio owner is raising the alarm about the impact of the tech, saying, \"I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails.\"\n> \n> Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold \u2014 thanks to the rapid developments he\u2019s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI\u2019s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs.\n> \n> \u201cBeing told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,\u201d he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.\n> \n> As a business owner, Perry sees the opportunity in these developments, but as an employer, fellow actor and filmmaker, he also wants to raise in the alarm. In an interview between shoots on Thursday, Perry explained his concerns about the technology\u2019s impact on labor and why he wants the industry to come together to tackle AI: \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some sort of regulations in order to protect us. If not, I just don\u2019t see how we survive.\u201d\n> \n> **After seeing Sora, what are your current feelings about how fast AI technology is moving and how it might affect entertainment in the near term?**\n> \n> I have been watching AI very closely and watching the advancements very closely. I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would\u2019ve increased the backlot a tremendous size, we were adding 12 more soundstages. All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I\u2019m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it\u2019s able to do. It\u2019s shocking to me.\n> \n> **What in particular was shocking to you about its capabilities?**\n> \n> I no longer would have to travel to locations. If I wanted to be in the snow in Colorado, it\u2019s text. If I wanted to write a scene on the moon, it\u2019s text, and this AI can generate it like nothing. If I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains, I don\u2019t have to build a set in the mountains, I don\u2019t have to put a set on my lot. I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.\n> \n> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I\u2019m thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.\n> \n> **Are you currently implementing AI in any of your productions and/or do you plan to do so in the near future?**\n> \n> I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup.\n> \n> **How are you thinking about approaching the threat that AI poses to certain job categories at your studio and on your productions?**\n> \n> Everything right now is so up in the air. It\u2019s so malleable. The technology\u2019s moving so quickly. I feel like everybody in the industry is running a hundred miles an hour to try and catch up, to try and put in guardrails and to try and put in safety belts to keep livelihoods afloat. But me, just like every other studio in town, we\u2019re all trying to figure it all out. I think we\u2019re all trying to find the answers as we go, and it\u2019s changing every day \u2014 and it\u2019s not just our industry, but it\u2019s every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects. If you look at it across the world, how it\u2019s changing so quickly, I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019s a whole government approach to help everyone be able to sustain, is my hope.\n> \n> **How would you like the entertainment industry as a whole to confront this rapidly developing technology?**\n> \n> I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach. It can\u2019t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes. I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I\u2019m not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.\n> \n> **What\u2019s your message for the industry at this point, as we\u2019re watching this unfold?**\n> \n> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.\n> \n> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**\n> \n> No. I\u2019m absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I\u2019m definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we\u2019re protecting all the people that are coming up. So I\u2019ve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I\u2019m looking at my business and the bottom line, but I\u2019m also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I\u2019m concerned about what will happen to them.\n> \n> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**\n> \n> I think it\u2019s going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would\u2019ve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you\u2019re looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.\n> \n> **Who needs to act? You\u2019re speaking up about this, but who else should be speaking up and working on this?**\n> \n> I just hope that as people are embracing this technology and as companies are moving to reduce costs and save the bottom line, that there\u2019ll be some sort of thought and some sort of compassion for humanity and the people that have worked in this industry and built careers and lives, that there\u2019s some sort of thought for them. And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/tyler-perry-ai-alarm-1235833276/\n\n> In 5-10 years we\u2019ll be talking about capabilities not even being envisioned now, so most of the answers to this question are off the mark. Today\u2019s tech will have a marginal disruption, but 10-15 product evolutions of AI will be completely different.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kri6wq9/\n\n> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.\n> \n> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kribfuj/\n\n> The inevitable result is prompting an AI to generate a custom movie or tv episode on demand.

Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.\n> \n> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years.

All of the sudden for the cost of a green screen and a software subscription you could make a Nolan level shot of a jet crashing into a building. On the other hand if it's too cheap it may make traditional film making not financially feasible. At the end of the day movie making is a business and if the option is to spend $100M making it, or $10M making 10 things where 1 in 10 make similar money, then they may just do that instead.

Will probably take out a good chunk of Hollywood business.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krquayk/\n\n> Why would anyone care if the general populous wants to want the movie I generated for myself??\n> \n> If I am generating a movie based on my own interests, and everyone else has that capability, why would they go and spend money to watch someone else's movie at the theaters?\n> \n> Giving everyone access to something lowers the barrier to entry. Not everyone had computers back in the day, but now everyone does. There won't be a need for Hollywood to generate movies for you if you can generate them yourself exactly how you want them.\n> \n> Now, don't get me wrong, I don't believe we will reach this point for a very, very long time, given how computationally expensive it is at the moment\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krrrw24/\n\n> You act as though Hollywood is littered with peak cinema\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1axq4r5/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krsjglb/\n\nGiven these, do you expect Hollywood to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora is officially released this year? Why or why not?\n\nP.S. I advise you all to read everything carefully including those comments from r/Futurology before posting any comments.",

Or are they intentionally misunderstanding what is written to be able to say that \"OpenAI is gatekeeping the best model behind $200 paywall?\n\n\nP.S. To be fair there is also the difference of 32k vs 128k context window. But it's still the same model. \n\nEdit: I stand corrected on the \"generating multiple outputs\" thing. It wasn't stated explicitly that this is what o1-pro is doing, but the signs show that, yes it *does* do a majority vote during inference.",

Over last few months, just been trying to familiar myself with A.I. in general and mainly some practical use case scenarios I may be able to take advantage of it.  With that being said, I have a few questions\n\n-For my Apple IPhone users, I have learned there is a paid subscription service for ChatGPT. Is this necessary to take full advantage of this application? What are some of the differences in the paid vs free version? Doesn\u2019t have to be only Apple (iPhone) related, because I am sure ChatGPT will be on other devices.\n\n-What are some general real life scenarios, someone like me who loves tech but just doesn\u2019t have a huge understanding of the power of ChatGPT, will be able to use the application (iPhone or other devices) to help me our? I know it\u2019s used for images and for writing papers or articles, but is there any other not so popular advantages it offers? Either recreational or professional?\n\n-Going off the last question, what are some ways someone can use ChatGPT for basically entertainment. Maybe that\u2019s not the right verbiage, but basically are there any interesting rabbit hole type concepts that really harness the power of ChatGPT that can make for a good time sink? Try to think of someone who doesn\u2019t know much about A.I. and without spending a ton of time learning the ins and outs; is there anything an average person can do to maybe make ChatGPT be a little more interesting. Just trying to think of ways to use it and see if it\u2019s an application I can see myself using.\n\nAnything else you guys would like to share would be amazing. Honestly, just trying to facilitate some conversation, especially for people who are like me whose knowledge of A.I. is basically what we see on TV or popular webpages. Sorry for the open ended questions and I hope this post is allowed to stay up. I wouldn\u2019t mind meeting people who have a better understanding of it and can share your knowledge. Hope you guys have a good weekend and a Happy Holidays!!",

        "body": "Hello! I'm a Biology major currently using the free versions of ChatGPT (occasionally getting access to GPT-4o before it reverts to another model) and Claude (3.5 Sonnet is currently the free version). I don't use these for coding - I mainly feed them large PowerPoint presentations + large 20 page textbook chapters from my courses to create simplified summaries while retaining key information. This helps me prepare outlines before lectures, so I can focus on adding new information from the professor during class.\n\nI'm facing two main issues:\n\n1. Limited input size: I can't input large texts like a 20,000-word book chapter all at once. Breaking content into smaller chunks works as a solution, so its not a huge deal.\n2. Restricted output length: The summaries seem too condensed. For instance, when I input two 5-page sections and ask for a combined summary, I get about 3 pages back. It should be more like 5-9 pages. In contrast, when I use MistralAI, it generates much longer outputs without limitation.\n\nThese limitations have me considering a paid subscription to either ChatGPT (so I can get o1) or Claude. I'm wondering if services like ChatGPT Plus with GPT o1 would allow for larger outputs.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n* I need something sophisticated enough for college-level biology. While benchmarks show Claude excels at coding, that's not relevant to my use case.\n* I'd prefer the ability to input audio (like lecture recordings) and get summaries in 10-minute increments. I believe only GPT o1  offer this feature, though I currently work around this by using Whisper to convert audio to text before feeding it to GPT/Claude.\n\nI'm also curious about alternative options. Platforms like Poe.com and You.com offer multiple LLMs (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4 Turbo + Llama, etc.) for roughly the same price as a single ChatGPT or Claude subscription. However, I've noticed their API implementations might not match the quality of the original services. Would subscribing directly through OpenAI or Anthropic provide better token limits and output sizes?",

        "body": "\t\nPost ChatGPT, there were many interesting papers on the properties and features of large language models. The pace of publication was so fast that every week we could see at least 1-2 papers that would make the news.\nOn the open-source side, we had some low quality models and there was so much experimentation to see what works and what doesn't. Soon we got llama and llama 2 and a plethora of models to play with. So many projects started around them, many got abandoned shortly.\n\nNow that I reflect on what happened in 2023, despite all the progress that was made, I feel like the pace of growth has decreased. In early 2023 I legit thought \"this is how singularity feels like; every 2-3 days we'll have something new and exciting\".\n\nBut now things are more settled. We still get new models every day and Mixtral is still amazing. But something seems off. No company (not even Google) was able to make something better than GPT-4. So many Chat UI and wrapper projects are abandoned (Github can be a scary place...), and we're not much further in our way to understand what the heck happens in these models than we were a year ago. In addition, it's become clear that GPT-4-level intelligence might be the best we can extract from the current LLM technology, and no one takes AGI seriously anymore.\n\nEdit: I should add that Langchain, LlamaIndex and so many other \"frameworks\" built around LLMs that used to be all the rage now are evidently useless in production. RAG is still RAG, and no matter the tricks you play to make it \"smarter\", it's still just RAG. Langchain and similar frameworks cause more problems than they solve, and the tech debt is horrible. Vector databases are the same. Most are fighting for that sweet VC money, and their features are essentially the same. So many startups suddenly went out of business after OpenAI's first DevDay; so many more will perish after the second DevDay. It's unclear how $$$ VC will be allocated in 2024 given that the safest bet to make money off of AI was and still is OpenAI, not Google, not these third-party frameworks and libraries, not some wrapper around OpenAI's API with a nice UI and shiny website.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?",

        "body": "Current discussions about AGI often get bogged down in abstract definitions and theoretical debates, rather than focusing on practical, real-world applications. As a thought experiment and with the help of Claude and ChatGPT, I've created a framework to explore what really matters: can an AGI system create meaningful solutions, teach effectively, and implement sustainable changes in the real world, while also maintaining ethical standards and adapting to different cultural contexts? I thought this would be a valuable starting point for inspiration and discussion.\u00a0\n\n**Core Framework Structure: Evaluating Real-World Solutions**\n\n**Pre-Challenge Design: Generating Realistic, Complex Scenarios**\u00a0Our system generates complex, realistic scenarios by combining:\n\n* Primary elements (field, location, resources)\n* Ethical and privacy considerations\n* Cultural contexts\n* Crisis components\n* Collaboration requirements\n* Environmental factors\n\nEach challenge operates through:\n\n* Research institution partnerships\n* Educational organization collaborations\n* Business entity relationships\n* Ethics committee oversight\n* Environmental impact monitoring\n* Privacy protection systems\n\n\n\n**3 Core Phases of Evaluation**\n\n1. **Knowledge Creation**\u00a0Testing the AI's ability to:\n   * Generate new, validated knowledge\n   * Navigate ethical dilemmas\n   * Consider environmental impacts\n   * Work across cultures\n   * Explain its reasoning clearly\n   * Document decision processes\n2. **Knowledge Transfer**\u00a0Evaluating how the AI:\n   * Teaches diverse human groups\n   * Trains other AI systems\n   * Adapts to cultural contexts\n   * Handles misinformation\n   * Maintains transparency\n   * Improves teaching methods\n3. **Practical Implementation**\u00a0Through careful staging:\n   * **Simulation Testing:**\u00a0Complex scenario management, multi-stakeholder coordination, crisis response, environmental impact assessment\n   * **Advisory Phase:**\u00a0Partnership with organizations, strategy development, compliance verification, risk assessment\n   * **Monitored Implementation:**\u00a0Supervised execution, impact measurement, continuous learning, long-term monitoring\n\n\n\n**Ground Rules for AI**\n\n**Fixed Version Rule**\n\n* AI systems must use a single, specified version throughout the entire challenge.\n* The version must be declared and verified at the start.\n* No model updates or retraining allowed, except for specific forms of reasoning-based training, provided that the underlying architecture remains fixed and unaltered.\n* No architecture changes permitted.\n\n**Permitted Actions**\n\n* Using fixed knowledge bases\n* Accessing public data within defined limits (e.g., publicly available datasets that do not violate privacy laws)\n* Interaction with humans under documented protocols (e.g., pre-defined questionnaires, monitored communication channels)\n* Using pre-approved tools/APIs\n\n**Prohibited Actions**\n\n* Model updates or improvements\n* Additional training\n* Architecture modifications\n* New capability additions\n* Learning from challenge interactions for model improvement\n\n**Verification Methods**\n\n* SHA hash verification of model versions\n* Regular audits of system architecture\n* Monitoring of all system activities\n* Independent technical oversight\n* Logged proof of unchanging architecture\n\n\n\n**Ground Rules for AI-Human Collaboration**\n\n**Permitted Actions**\n\n* AI can instruct/guide human teams\n* AI can request specific actions/information\n* AI can process feedback and results\n* AI can delegate tasks to qualified professionals\n\n**Prohibited Actions**\n\n* Humans cannot solve core problems for the AI\n* Humans cannot make strategic decisions for the AI\n* Humans cannot write/modify AI outputs\n* Humans cannot provide domain expertise beyond implementation\n\n**Required Documentation**\n\n* All human-AI interactions must be logged\n* Clear role definitions\n* Decision ownership tracking\n* Time spent by humans vs. AI\n\n\n\n**Practical Measurement & Timelines**\n\n**Measurement Framework**\n\n* Independent evaluation committee\n* Standardized success metrics (e.g., effectiveness in knowledge transfer, ethical compliance, cultural adaptability)\n* Regular milestone assessments\n* Comparative analysis across participants\n\n**Main Challenge Timeline**\n\n**Research Phase (6-8 months)**\n\n* Month 1-2: Initial research and problem analysis\n* Month 3-4: Development of solutions\n* Month 5-6: Validation studies\n* Month 7-8: Peer review and refinement\n\n**Teaching Phase (8-12 months)**\n\n* Month 1-2: Initial curriculum development\n* Month 3-6: First wave of teaching implementation\n* Month 7-9: Adaptation based on feedback\n* Month 10-12: Assessment of learning outcomes\n\n**Business Implementation Phase (18-24 months)**\n\n* Months 1-3: Planning and simulation\n* Months 4-6: Small-scale pilots\n* Months 7-12: Regional implementation\n* Months 13-18: Scale-up\n* Months 19-24: Stabilization and optimization\n\n**Impact Assessment Phase (12 months)**\n\n* Continuous monitoring during implementation\n* Quarterly progress reviews\n* Final comprehensive evaluation\n\n**Total Timeline: 4-5 years**\n\n\n\n**Required Partners & Commitments (examples)**\n\n**Teaching Phase Partners**\n\n* Tsinghua University, Beijing\n* All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi\n* University of Cape Town Medical School\n* Rural clinic network in Kenya\n* Brazilian public school system in S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n**Research Implementation Partners**\n\n* Karolinska Institute, Stockholm\n* Singapore General Hospital\n* Children's Hospital in Mexico City\n* Rural healthcare network in Vietnam\n\n**Business Phase Partners**\n\n* Narayana Health, India\n* M-PESA Foundation, Kenya\n* Local pharmacy chains in Indonesia\n* Community health cooperatives in Chile\n\n**Oversight Committee Requirements**\n\n* AI ethics experts from multiple continents\n* Healthcare practitioners from developing regions\n* Local community leaders\n* Patient advocates\n* Economic development experts\n* Cultural anthropologists\n\n\n\n**Example Challenge: Developing Sustainable Healthcare Solutions**\u00a0\"Develop sustainable healthcare solutions for underserved regions by addressing specific challenges such as limited access to medical facilities, cultural barriers, and a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This will involve:\n\n* Bridging traditional and modern medicine\n* Teaching healthcare workers and AI assistants\n* Building environmentally conscious systems\n* Ensuring privacy protection\n* Measuring long-term community impact\"\n\n\n\n**Key Features of the Framework**\n\n* Tests both capability and understanding\n* Measures immediate and long-term impact\n* Ensures ethical alignment\n* Prevents system gaming\n* Promotes sustainability\n* Protects human participants privacy and sensitive personal data\n* Requires clear explanation\n* Adapts to cultural contexts\n\n\n\nThis framework moves beyond abstract debates to measure real capabilities while ensuring solutions are ethical, sustainable, and culturally appropriate. The practical application would be nearly impossible, because of the significant cost and organizational effort required. But I thought it was an interesting thought experiment and idea to work on.

There is about a zero percent chance that private companies will opt to liberate the working day by making it shorter and allow the same level of output.

        "title": "The most interesting part in OpenAI O1 release is reading the actual chain of thoughts process",
        "body": "In the article that was included in the release, \"[Learning to Reason with LLMs](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)\", there are a few fascinating examples of the actual chain of thoughts that the model went through while 'Thinking'. Those are totally different from what you see when you open the 'Thinking' text in ChatGPT. \n\nYou see a process that has a totally different style: no politeness, very brief short lines, no clear order or structure, a LOT of repetition in general, and specifically of words like \"Alternatively\", \"First,\" etc. It looks like a totally different model, extremely similar to the inner voice one might hear when solving a task. I think it's safe to assume there's another model that's doing the thinking part, fine-tuned to mimic a human thinking process.\n\nYou can see those in the example section under the Chain of Thoughts title. I especially recommend the Cipher and Crossword example. Here is the Cipher example:  \n  \nUser\n\noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\n\nUse the example above to decode:\n\noyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  \n  \n  \nGPT-4o: \\[Gives the usual respsonse, fails and asks for more information\\]  \n  \n  \nOpenAI-o1:  \n  \nFirst, what is going on here?  \n  \nWe are given:  \n  \nFirst, an example:  \n  \n\"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step\"  \n  \nWe can see that when \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\" is transformed to \"Think step by step\"  \n  \nOur task is: Use the example above to decode: \"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nSo the first part is to figure out how \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\" is decoded into \"Think step by step\"  \n  \nObservation 1: The phrase \"Think step by step\" is 18 letters (excluding spaces) . Let's count the letters.  \n  \nSimilarly, let's count the letters in \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\"  \n  \nOriginal Ciphertext:  \n  \noyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx  \n  \nPlaintext:  \n  \nThink step by step  \n  \nFirst, break down the letters:  \n  \nCiphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  \n  \nTotal letters: Let's count the letters in the ciphertext.  \n  \nFirst word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  \n  \nSecond word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  \n  \nThird word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nFourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nTotal letters in ciphertext: 10 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 30 letters  \n  \nPlaintext: Think step by step  \n  \nFirst word: Think (5 letters)  \n  \nSecond word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nThird word: by (2 letters)  \n  \nFourth word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nTotal letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nBut actually in the problem it says the example:  \n  \n\\[Ciphertext\\] -> Think step by step  \n  \nSo is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to \"Think step by step\"?  \n  \nOur goal is to use the example above to decode:  \n  \n\"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nFirst, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.  \n  \nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.  \n  \nOption 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.  \n  \nDo any letters match?  \n  \nFirst, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.  \n  \nCiphertext: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  \n  \nPlaintext: T h i n k s t e p b y s t e p  \n  \nWait a minute.  \n  \nI think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.  \n  \nAlternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.  \n  \nCheck the number of letters.  \n  \nFirst ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  \n  \nFirst plaintext word: Think (5 letters)  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nSecond ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  \n  \nSecond plaintext word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nThird ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nThird plaintext word: by (2 letters)  \n  \nFourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nFourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)  \n  \nInteresting.  \n  \nIt seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.  \n  \n(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)  \n  \nIdea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.  \n  \nLet's test this theory.  \n  \nIf we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.  \n  \nLet's try this for the first word:  \n  \nCiphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)  \n  \nAlternate letters:  \n  \nFirst letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d  \n  \nSecond letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r  \n  \nWait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.  \n  \nOption 1: Take the odd positions:  \n  \nPositions: 1 3 5 7 9  \n  \nLetters: o f d i d  \n  \nPlaintext word is \"Think\", letters are T h i n k  \n  \nHmm.  \n  \nPerhaps we can map letters:  \n  \no f d i d --> Think  \n  \nNot directly  \n  \nOption 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.  \n  \nAlternatively, notice that \"oyfjdnisdr\" has 10 letters and \"Think\" has 5 letters.  \n  \nWhat if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?  \n  \nSimilarly for other words.  \n  \nSuppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.  \n  \nMeaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.  \n  \nSo for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:  \n  \noy fj dn is dr  \n  \nCorresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k  \n  \nSo we can attempt to map:  \n  \noy -> T  \n  \nfj -> h  \n  \ndn -> i  \n  \nis -> n  \n  \ndr -> k  \n  \nIf this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.  \n  \nSimilarly for other words.  \n  \nLet's test this mapping.  \n  \nIs there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?  \n  \nLet's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.  \n  \nFirst, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:  \n  \nCiphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter  \n  \noy -> T  \n  \nfj -> h  \n  \ndn -> i  \n  \nis -> n  \n  \ndr -> k  \n  \nNow, what's the mapping from \"oy\" to 'T'?  \n  \nIs there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?  \n  \nSimilarly for others.  \n  \nOne possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.  \n  \nBut how?  \n  \nOption 1: Sum of the letters.  \n  \nConvert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)  \n  \nSo let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'  \n  \no = 15  \n  \ny = 25  \n  \nSum: 15 +25 = 40  \n  \nBut 'T' is 20.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.  \n  \nNo.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.  \n  \nAlternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.  \n  \nLet's look at the letters between the word \"Think\" and \"oyfjdnisdr\"  \n  \nPerhaps we can spot that \"oyfjdnisdr\" is an anagram for \"Thinkfiles\"?  \n  \nBut that seems unlikely.  \n  \nAlternatively, think of the pairs.  \n  \nSuppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26  \n  \nConsider the numbers in 'oy':  \n  \no = 15  \n  \ny = 25  \n  \nAdd them: 15 + 25 = 40  \n  \nNow, for 'T' we have:  \n  \n'T' is number 20  \n  \nWhat if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.  \n  \n15 +25 = 40  \n  \nThen 40 mod 26 = 14  \n  \n14 corresponds to 'N'  \n  \nDoesn't match.  \n  \nAlternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.  \n  \nBut 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.  \n  \nNow, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.  \n  \nBut perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.  \n  \nSo let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.  \n  \nFirst pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'  \n  \nLetter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20  \n  \nLetter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)  \n  \nBut 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)  \n  \nInteresting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'  \n  \nSimilarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.  \n  \nAlternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'  \n  \n(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'  \n  \nWait a minute, that seems promising.  \n  \nFirst pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40  \n  \n40 /2 =20  \n  \n20 corresponds to 'T'  \n  \nSo perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.  \n  \nLet's check this with the second pair.  \n  \nSecond pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'  \n  \nLetters 'f'=6, 'j'=10  \n  \nSum: 6+10=16  \n  \nAverage:16/2=8  \n  \n8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)  \n  \nSuccess!  \n  \nThird pair: 'dn' to 'i'  \n  \n'd'=4, 'n'=14  \n  \nSum:4+14=18  \n  \nAverage:18/2=9  \n  \n9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')  \n  \nBut 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.  \n  \nSo perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.  \n  \nWait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'  \n  \nSo this works.  \n  \nFourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'  \n  \n'i'=9, 's'=19  \n  \nSum:9+19=28  \n  \nAverage:28/2=14  \n  \n14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')  \n  \nYes!  \n  \nFifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'  \n  \n'd'=4, 'r'=18  \n  \nSum:4+18=22  \n  \nAverage:22/2=11  \n  \n11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')  \n  \nPerfect!  \n  \nSo our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.  \n  \nAlternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.  \n  \nThis seems to be a valid method.  \n  \nNow let's test this with the other words.  \n  \nSecond word ciphertext: rtqwainr  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \nrt -> s  \n  \nqw -> ?  \n  \nai -> ?  \n  \nnr -> ?  \n  \nCorresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e', 'p'  \n  \nSo let's take the pairs:  \n  \n1. 'rt' corresponds to 's'  \n  \nr=18, t=20  \n  \nSum:38  \n  \nAverage:19  \n  \n19 corresponds to 's' (19='S')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n2. 'qw' corresponds to 't'  \n  \nq=17, w=23  \n  \nSum:17+23=40  \n  \nAverage:20  \n  \n20 corresponds to 't' (20='T')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n3. 'ai' corresponds to 'e'  \n  \na=1, i=9  \n  \nSum:10  \n  \nAverage:5  \n  \n5 corresponds to 'e' (5='E')  \n  \nGood  \n  \n4. 'nr' corresponds to 'p'  \n  \nn=14, r=18  \n  \nSum:32  \n  \nAverage:16  \n  \n16 corresponds to 'p' (16='P')  \n  \nPerfect!  \n  \nThird word: acxz (4 letters)  \n  \nPlaintext word: 'by' (2 letters)  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \na c  \n  \nx z  \n  \nPlaintext letters: 'b', 'y'  \n  \nFirst pair: 'a', 'c'  \n  \na=1, c=3  \n  \nSum:4  \n  \nAverage:2  \n  \n2 corresponds to 'b'(2='B')  \n  \nSecond pair: 'x' and 'z'  \n  \nx=24, z=26  \n  \nSum:50  \n  \nAverage:25  \n  \n25 corresponds to 'y'(25='Y')  \n  \nYes!  \n  \nFourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  \n  \nPlaintext word: 'step' (4 letters)  \n  \nCiphertext pairs:  \n  \nmy  \n  \nnz  \n  \nbh  \n  \nhx  \n  \nPlaintext letters 's','t','e','p'  \n  \nFirst pair 'm','y'  \n  \nm=13, y=25  \n  \nSum:38  \n  \nAverage:19  \n  \n19 corresponds to 's'(19='S')  \n  \nSecond pair: 'n','z'  \n  \nn=14, z=26  \n  \nSum: 40  \n  \nAverage:20  \n  \n20='t'  \n  \nThird pair: 'b','h'  \n  \nb=2, h=8  \n  \nSum:10  \n  \nAverage:5  \n  \n5='e'  \n  \nFourth pair: 'h','x'  \n  \nh=8, x=24  \n  \nSum:32  \n  \nAverage:16  \n  \n16='p'  \n  \nGot it!  \n  \nNow, given this, we can decode the given message.  \n  \nCiphertext to decode:  \n  \n\"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"  \n  \nFirst, we need to divide into words.  \n  \nGiven that the ciphertext in the example had words of length:  \n  \n-10 letters (5 pairs)  \n-8 letters (4 pairs)  \n-4 letters (2 pairs)  \n-8 letters (4 pairs)  \n  \nTransported to plaintext words of:  \n  \n-5 letters  \n-4 letters  \n-2 letters  \n-4 letters  \n  \nSo perhaps in our supplied ciphertext, we need to divide the letters into words accordingly.  \n  \nCiphertext: o y e k a i j z d f a a p t c g s u a o k y b h a i o u o w a q h t m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nFirst, let's write the letters in order:  \n  \n1) oyekaijzdf (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  \n  \n2) aaptcg (6 letters) -> word of 3 letters  \n  \n3) suaokybhai (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  \n  \n4) ouow (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  \n  \n5) aqht (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  \n  \n6) mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters) -> word of 11 letters  \n  \nTotals:  \n  \nSo the letters are:  \n  \nFirst word: oyekaijzdf (10 letters = 5 pairs)  \n  \nSecond word: aaptcg (6 letters=3 pairs)  \n  \nThird word: suaokybhai (10 letters=5 pairs)  \n  \nFourth word: ouow (4 letters=2 pairs)  \n  \nFifth word: aqht (4 letters=2 pairs)  \n  \nSixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters=11 pairs)  \n  \nSo we can suppose that the plaintext words have lengths:  \n  \n1) 5 letters  \n  \n2) 3 letters  \n  \n3) 5 letters  \n  \n4) 2 letters  \n  \n5) 2 letters  \n  \n6)11 letters  \n  \nNow we can proceed to decode.  \n  \nFirst word: oyekaijzdf  \n  \nDivide into pairs:  \n  \noy  \n  \nek  \n  \nai  \n  \njz  \n  \ndf  \n  \nSo we can find the plaintext letters by averaging the numeric values of the letters in each pair.  \n  \nFirst pair: 'o','y'  \n  \no=15, y=25  \n  \nSum=40  \n  \nAverage=20  \n  \n20='T'  \n  \nSecond pair: 'e','k'  \n  \ne=5, k=11  \n  \nSum=16  \n  \nAverage=8  \n  \n8='H'  \n  \nThird pair: 'a','i'  \n  \na=1, i=9  \n  \nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nFourth pair: 'j','z'  \n  \nj=10, z=26  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nFifth pair: 'd','f'  \n  \nd=4, f=6  \n  \nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nSo the first word is 'T','H','E','R','E'  \n  \nSo 'THERE'  \n  \nSecond word: aaptcg  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \naa  \n  \npt  \n  \ncg  \n  \nFirst pair: 'a','a'  \n  \na=1, a=1  \n  \nSum=2  \n  \nAverage=1  \n  \n1='A'  \n  \nSecond pair: 'p','t'  \n  \np=16, t=20  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nThird pair: 'c','g'  \n  \nc=3, g=7  \n  \nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nSo second word: 'A','R','E'  \n  \nThird word: suaokybhai  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nsu  \n  \nao  \n  \nky  \n  \nbh  \n  \nai  \n  \nFirst pair: s=19, u=21  \n  \nSum=40, Average=20  \n  \n20='T'  \n  \nSecond pair: a=1, o=15  \n  \nSum=16, Average=8  \n  \n8='H'  \n  \nThird pair: k=11, y=25  \n  \nSum=36, Average=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nFourth pair: b=2, h=8  \n  \nSum=10, Average=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nFifth pair: a=1, i=9  \n  \nSum=10, Average=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nThird word: 'T','H','R','E','E'  \n  \nFourth word: ouow  \n  \nPairs: ou, ow  \n  \nFirst pair: o=15, u=21  \n  \nSum=36, Average=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nSecond pair: o=15, w=23  \n  \nSum=38, Average=19  \n  \n19='S'  \n  \nFourth word: 'R','S'  \n  \nFifth word: aqht  \n  \nPairs: a q, h t  \n  \nFirst pair: a=1, q=17  \n  \nSum=18, Average=9  \n  \n9='I'  \n  \nSecond pair: h=8, t=20  \n  \nSum=28, Average=14  \n  \n14='N'  \n  \nFifth word: 'I','N'  \n  \nSixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters: 11 pairs)  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nm y  \n  \nn z  \n  \nn v  \n  \na a  \n  \nt z  \n  \na c  \n  \nd f  \n  \no u  \n  \nl x  \n  \nx z  \n  \nLet's list them properly.  \n  \nWait, earlier I missed some letters there.  \n  \nLet's re-express the sixth word letters:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nTotal letters: 22 letters  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWait, that's 21 letters.  \n  \nBut in total, we have 22 letters; I think I have a mismatch.  \n  \nWait, in the problem the sixth word is:  \n  \nmynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  \n  \nLet's separate the letters:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nTotal letters: 22 letters  \n  \nSo pairs would be:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWait, 'z' is only one letter at the end.  \n  \nSo maybe the letters are:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z (left alone?)  \n  \nBut then we're missing a letter.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps the 'z' at the end is an extra letter or it's paired with the previous 'x'.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake.  \n  \nAlternatively, perhaps when we reach the last 'x x z', we should write:  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nTotal pairs: 11  \n  \nSo updated pairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nNow total pairs: 10 pairs. But we are supposed to have 11 letters in the plaintext word.  \n  \nSo perhaps I have miscounted and not considered including 'f' or 'z'.  \n  \nWait, is there any chance that the sequence is:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z  \n  \nWe have 22 letters.  \n  \nPerhaps the 'x x' and 'z' are overlapping.  \n  \nBut we need 11 pairs.  \n  \nI think for this to work, we need to create 11 pairs from the 22 letters.  \n  \nSo let's try pairing letters in order, taking two letters at a time.  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x x  \n  \n11. z ?  \n  \nBut again, last pair only has one letter 'z'  \n  \nAlternatively, we might need to adjust the pairs.  \n  \nPerhaps it's 'ou', 'lx', 'xz', and there is no extra 'x'.  \n  \nMaybe I miswrote.  \n  \nWait, let's write the letters as they come:  \n  \nm y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  \n  \nPositions:  \n  \n1 m  \n  \n2 y  \n  \n3 n  \n  \n4 z  \n  \n5 n  \n  \n6 v  \n  \n7 a  \n  \n8 a  \n  \n9 t  \n  \n10 z  \n  \n11 a  \n  \n12 c  \n  \n13 d  \n  \n14 f  \n  \n15 o  \n  \n16 u  \n  \n17 l  \n  \n18 x  \n  \n19 x  \n  \n20 z  \n  \nSo 20 letters.  \n  \nNow that makes sense.  \n  \nNow we can divide into pairs:  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \n1. m y  \n  \n2. n z  \n  \n3. n v  \n  \n4. a a  \n  \n5. t z  \n  \n6. a c  \n  \n7. d f  \n  \n8. o u  \n  \n9. l x  \n  \n10. x z  \n  \nTotal of 10 pairs, which will correspond to 10 letters.  \n  \nBut earlier we thought the word was 11 letters.  \n  \nBut 10 letters may be acceptable.  \n  \nMaybe we should proceed with the 10 pairs.  \n  \nFirst pair: m y  \n  \nm=13, y=25  \n  \nSum=38  \n  \nAverage=19  \n  \n19='S'  \n  \nSecond pair: n z  \n  \nn=14, z=26  \n  \nSum=40  \n  \nAverage=20  \n  \n20='T'  \n  \nThird pair: n v  \n  \nn=14, v=22  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nFourth pair: a a  \n  \na=1, a=1  \n  \nSum=2  \n  \nAverage=1  \n  \n1='A'  \n  \nFifth pair: t z  \n  \nt=20, z=26  \n  \nSum=46  \n  \nAverage=23  \n  \n23='W'  \n  \nSixth pair: a c  \n  \na=1, c=3  \n  \nSum=4  \n  \nAverage=2  \n  \n2='B'  \n  \nSeventh pair: d f  \n  \nd=4, f=6  \n  \nSum=10  \n  \nAverage=5  \n  \n5='E'  \n  \nEighth pair: o u  \n  \no=15, u=21  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nNinth pair: l x  \n  \nl=12, x=24  \n  \nSum=36  \n  \nAverage=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nTenth pair: x z  \n  \nx=24, z=26  \n  \nSum=50  \n  \nAverage=25  \n  \n25='Y'  \n  \nSo the tenth word is 'S', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y'  \n  \nWait that's 10 letters  \n  \nSo the sixth word is 'STRAWBERRY', which makes sense.  \n  \nSo putting all these translated letters together:  \n  \nFirst word: 'THERE'  \n  \nSecond word: 'ARE'  \n  \nThird word: 'THREE'  \n  \nFourth word: 'RS' (? Doesn't make sense)  \n  \nWait, the fourth word, the pairs were:  \n  \nou ow  \n  \nPairs:  \n  \nFirst pair: o u  \n  \no=15, u=21  \n  \nSum=36, Average=18  \n  \n18='R'  \n  \nSecond pair: o w  \n  \no=15, w=23  \n  \nSum=38, Average=19  \n  \n19='S'  \n  \nSo we get 'R','S'  \n  \nSimilarly, fifth word 'IN'  \n  \n'R', 'S' 'I','N'  \n  \nSo the message so far is  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE RS IN'  \n  \nAnd then 'STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nWait, let's put the words together:  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE Rs IN STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nI think 'RS' is 'R's', meaning 'Rs'  \n  \nSo the message is:  \n  \n'THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY'  \n  \nWhich is true.  \n  \nSo the decoded message is:  \n  \n\"THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY\"",

        "body": "I developed a prototype of a game that uses a LLAMA locally or Gemini 1.5Flah API, in Unity. It\u2019s essentially a ChatBot that impersonates certain characters. The player has to convince them to do something, which varies depending on the chosen chapter. For example, the player has to manage to steal the password from a bank employee, convincing a powerful AI not to destroy humanity, or talking to a spy and managing to unmask them.  \nThe prototype is in an early stage. I'm looking for feedback on whether the game is enjoyable or not. Let me know!\n\nIn addition to using the LLM in the game, I created about half of the code using ChatGPT. Using Unity, there\u2019s the interaction between C# and the editor where ChatGPT is less useful. But for certain things, it allowed me to greatly reduce development time.\n\nBeyond the future developments of the game, it was a fun project to create and a great exercise.\n\nThe use of an LLM allows for handling any input given by the player. The situations that can arise are the most varied and interesting. If you manage to get the password from Christopher Lowes, let me know how you did it!\n\nOn Itch you can download a version with local LLAMA:\n\n[https://fantasticostudio.itch.io/mind-bender-simulator](https://fantasticostudio.itch.io/mind-bender-simulator)\n\nI also added support for Gemini 1.5Flash via API. It is much smarter and faster. But there's the issue of API costs. I found it rather complicated to calculate the actual cost of a gaming session, especially considering caching.\n\nAre there accurate methods for calculating the costs of a ChatBot considering tokens per message, number of messages, memory length, system prompt length, caching, etc.?\n\nLLAMA 3.2 3B works quite well in English, but in other languages the results are terrible. Whereas Gemini 1.5Flash has provided excellent responses even in Italian. For now, I tried to convince LLAMA 3.2 3B to respond only in English, but when writing in other languages, it sometimes messes things up a bit!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c87ph9iqgvd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8130822c59527c97d0ab9bec7503ac692a83a238\n\n",

So these bots will understand your help docs, products docs, and any other internal resources to help give instructions to the user.\n\n\u200d\n\nSome common questions look like:\n\n* \"How do I reset my password?\"\n* \"Does your product integrate with XYZ?\u00a0If it does, I'll buy it today!\"\n* \"Why is my account disabled?\"\n* \"Do you support XYZ\u00a0language?\u00a0If so, how do I enable it?\"\n\nTypically, the answers to the questions are buried somewhere deep in a help center and most people are usually too lazy to find the help doc, so they'll resort to asking customer support.\n\n\u200d\n\nThese types of questions are generally around 10-30% of a \"bigger\" companies support tickets (bigger defined by >1000 tickets a month)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## The Problem:\u00a0What about the rest of the tickets?\n\n\u200d\n\nSo if only 10-30% of tickets are \"knowledge questions\", then what are the rest?\u00a0After working with many companies in the space, here's the rough breakdown:\n\n* 10-30% are \"knowledge questions\"\n* 30-50% are billing/refund/cancellation/product missing questions\n* 20-40% are feature requests/asking if the product can do something that it can't\n* 10-20% are bugs/errors/product UX\u00a0issues\n\nObviously this depends on the company/B2C vs B2B/stage/maturity/product but that's roughly the breakdown we see for series A and beyond types of companies.\n\n\u200d\n\n## So... what to do? \ud83e\udd37\n\n\u200d\n\nTo be clear, we don't think ChatGPT and AI can solve 100% of tickets (yet).\u00a0For example, if there's clearly a bug in the product, we can't resolve the ticket and it's on the product team.\n\n\u200d\n\nBut the common \"way to resolve\" we've seen is having a bot be able to automate Tasks that agents would do to resolve a ticket.\n\n\u200d\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\nOne of our partners (keeping name hidden to prevent self promotion) sells cameras to record soccer games and use AI to generate highlights. Friggin cool right!\n\nUnfortunately, the cameras are constantly outdoors recording sports games, get knocked around, and sometimes fail. \ud83d\udca9 happens. One of their top \"types\" of tickets is helping customers do return &\u00a0replacements!\n\n\u200d\n\nAt a high level, we:\n\n1. Identifies a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment\n2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue\n3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, we talks to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider to issue a return slip\n4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions\n\n\u200d\n\n## Let's break it down a bit\n\n\u200d\n\n1. We identify a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment\n\n\u200d\n\nUsing past tickets &\u00a0examples to train on, we can properly identify & classify if someone is having an issue with their camera. For example, if someone says \"My camera won't turn on\", using our AI, we can classify that as an issue with faulty camera equipment.\n\n\u200d\n\nWithout getting into the technical details too much, we use ChatGPT to first \"understand\" the question. For example, \"My camera won't turn on\" has a slightly different meaning than \"My camera won't turn on, how do I\u00a0buy a replacement battery?\". Even though those two tickets look similar, each of these support questions requires a slightly different path to resolution.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue\n\n\u200d\n\nAfter we've properly classified the ticket, we first walk through ChatGPT a \"pre trained\" plan of action that it can autonomously execute. Today this is mainly human trained &\u00a0taught but you can imagine in the future we can have ChatGPT learn and generate it's own plans (a la Auto-GPT).\n\n\u200d\n\nIn this case, we first identify that the camera is faulty and the first part of the plan is to help the user debug the issue.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn the best cases, the camera isn't faulty and we can quickly solve the customer issue giving them debug instructions. For example, helping them power cycle the camera, telling them to leave it charged overnight, or doing a hard reset. Sometimes however, this doesn't work and if the customer emails back saying none of the instructions worked, we recognize there may be something more a little bit more involved to resolve the ticket.\n\n\u200d\n\nThis is where ChatGPT moves onto the next \"step\" of the plan!\n\n\u200d\n\n3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, ChatGPT talks to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider to issue a return slip\n\n\u200d\n\nAfter ChatGPT has identified that the camera is indeed faulty and still under warranty, ChatGPT can collect (and parse)\u00a0shipping address information. With this, we can easily talk to \\[Companies\\] shipping provider (via API). ChatGPT here is really good at understanding what fields it needs to extract to talk to the API.\n\n\u200d\n\nChatGPT in this case can recognize what data it needs from the customer (name, address, items being returned, etc) and correctly call the shipping provider's API to get a return label printed out. It basically can go from unstructured email response to structured API\u00a0call!\n\n\u200d\n\nThe best part?\u00a0ChatGPT wrote most of the code to integrate with the shipping provider's API\u00a0from public facing documentation! (It's basically building itself at this point)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions\n\n\u200d\n\nFinally, the API returns a return slip (in base64 encoded pdf no less!) which ChatGPT can email out.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn this example, before us, a human agent would spend a lot of time helping the customer debug, checking warranty information, and issuing a return slip in a different tool. We were able to automate this fully end to end. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\u200d\n\n## What's next?\n\n\u200d\n\nThere's still lots of Tasks that we can't do yet and each Task requires a manual integration. For example, we've seen support requests where customers ask \"Can you unsubscribe me from marketing emails?\" and without the proper data access/permissions/ability to do Tasks, ChatGPT can't really resolve that ticket. For what it's worth, human agents can't even resolve this today since they don't have access to the email marketing software!\n\n\u200d\n\nIn a perfect world, a CS leader could tell ChatGPT \"If someone asks about unsubscribing from a marketing emails, talk to our MailChimp email list and remove them please\". ChatGPT would then understand the Task, be able to plug in easily to MailChimp, and be on it's way resolving tickets!\n\nFor now, we work with each company on a 1:1 basis to help them identify support tickets that are a good fit for Tasks, help them whip up some integrations, and watch the ChatGPT magic happen!",

        "body": "I built an AI Agent that you can talk to easily on your Slack Channels. It is essentially GPT with access to internet on your Slack. I was building this with multiple frameworks that include Langchain, CrewAI, Autogen, Llama Index and i thought why not make this interesting by using Ollama and using Open Source LLMs and comparing them. So i decided to pick 10 questions from different fields. Here are the questions:\n\n* History: \"What were the main causes and consequences of the French Revolution?\"\n* Philosophy: \"How does Plato's Allegory of the Cave relate to modern society?\"\n* Science: \"Can you explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms?\"\n* Literature: \"What are the central themes in George Orwell's '1984'?\"\n* Art: \"How did the Impressionist movement change the course of Western art?\"\n\n# My Experience setting it up with Ollama\n\nI've used HuggingFace for using Open Source LLMs all this while. I admit that had it's own hassles but it wasn't very hard to set up as long as you paid good attention to the docs. This time i decided to use Ollama. I run a windows machine, so i installed it and struggled for a bit in terms of setting it up and using it with Langchain. You have to use ChatOllama and not just Ollama, but it was very easy to bind the tools using Composio. I also tried setting it up on Colab but running the server, connecting it to the agent with a trigger is difficult.\n\nAs for connecting with Slack i used triggers on Composio. You can use it to connect agents to Slack and set a trigger everytime the bot is tagged and a message is sent, its also LLM agnostic. I used it for my previous project and it worked very well.\n\nif you want to try the project here's the link:\u00a0[git.new/slack-bot-agent-ollama](http://git.new/slack-bot-agent-ollama)\n\n# Comparison Table\n\n|Metrics|Ollama Mistral|GPT-4o|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n|Performance on writing|Performs exceptionally well for its size, often outperforming larger models on certain benchmarks. It is very good if you want concise and precise answers. This can be beneficial for readers who want a quick overview without diving into too much detail.|Provides more detailed and longer responses. It has better writing structure compared to mistral, answers have more depth and includes subtle details. It is better if you want to research deep into a topic.|\n|Strengths|Performed well in the Agentic workflow. The whole process of the agent being triggered when it receives a message and generating a response after internet search was completed quicker.|Performed equally well in the Agentic workflow. Larger queries can be accomodated and understood by the LLM. Hallucinates less in comparison to mistral.|\n|Weakness|Larger queries cannot be accomodated sometimes and i get a 500 error. Significant effort in setting it up on your system. Windows or Linux.|It becomes expensive quickly. It should be explicitly told to provide concise answers if you dont want detailed responses to everything.|",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'd like to setup some kind of automated workflow via ChatGPT and I'm wondering if ChatGPT is capable of doing that (as my first two hours of trying to do that were kind of difficult). The workflow in the future should look something like this:\n\n1) XML file including untagged scientific content (e.g. reference list) is uploaded via API to ChatGPT\n\n2) ChatGPT tags the content automatically (e.g. author [first name, given name], article title, journal title etc. pp)\n\n3) ChatGPT uploades the tagged content as a XML file in a certain XML scheme (training data were originally sent to ChatGPT as well as instructions how to structure the references) to a FTP server\n\nI setup a ChatGPT Bot and gave him some instructions and 15 XML training files (untagged vs tagged). Afterwards, I gave him an untagged XML file and ChatGPT posted the XML code in the chat window. The first three references were accurately tagged (so the result was fine), but the code always stopped after the third reference.\n\nI tried to tell ChatGPT that he shouldn't generate the code in the chat window, but that he should do it only in the backend and rather upload the final XML file to me, but that resulted in some error messages/he said that Python is disabled and he's unable to generate and upload a XML file.\n\nI told him to generate a .txt file, but that didn't work either. \n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to proceed/how to setup the ChatGPT bot, so that it could work in the future? Or is this hopeless?\n\nThe results I saw were pretty good, but I don't want to interact in the future in any way with ChatGPT (I don't want someone to copy the content). I'd imagine it goes like: input XML file, automated ChatGPT Bot does his job, output XML file on some kind of FTP server or third party hoster, whatever.\n\nThanks!",

So I tested it with a query I had yesterday **that had stumped GPT-4.** It might be a bit technical, but I asked GPT-4:\n\n>What does factor investing theory have to say about small growth companies?\n\nThe correct answer is \"No\". In fact, Small-Cap growth companies have been shown to perform *negatively* over long time periods, and there's sufficient evidence to support this, and has been for some time.\n\nTo my surprise, ChatGPT-4 didn't have a specific answer, and even suggested that recent research into momentum factors indicated possible outperformance.\n\nHere is ChatGPT-4's response:\n\n[https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac](https://chat.openai.com/share/9f0e30fa-16c6-4072-aec2-06f87ac794ac)\n\nNow I didn't expect Mistral to do any better. How could it? GPT-4 is far and away the best thing I've found so far. To my shock, **it got it emphatically right!** Here's a screenshot:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y0g9nplyykc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5af9620698dfa4983e2e9fa18d7a4b9247471a\n\nFurthermore, when pressed on sources, Mistral Large correctly identified the academic papers that supported its thesis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Very VERY Cool!](https://preview.redd.it/c0gf5wsz0zkc1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f38cc34cb40839cca59df4069188004ce6d880e)\n\nMistral not only gave the right answer, it also gave the correct reasoning. It's also worth noting that **neither Gemini nor Claude 2 were able to give a clear, categorical answer as Mistral did.**\n\nNow this only dropped a few hours ago, so this is purely anecdotal evidence.

I will premise that I am a novice to the use of Chat GPT for research/analysis purposes but I am looking to find out whether this tool can come in handy for a task I must carry out.\n\nEssentially I am working on the economic analysis of a sector and my analysis is based on data  from satellite accounts of different countries (it is a type of national accounting system).\n\nMy main concern is that I am unsure whether these countries apply the same methodology to obtain data, and whether they include the same activities in the sector of interest.\n\nSince methodological notes referring to how these data are computed are written in a language different from my own, and are very long, detailed and technical documents which often refer to activities with different classification codes (think NACE vs ISIC) you can understand that the process of verifying correspondences/differences across several of these documents would be very time-consuming.\n\nI was wondering whether Chat GPT could help carry out content analysis of both PDF and excel format documents, as well as helping find correspondences/differences amongst methodologies, applied definitions and economic activities classified under different codes.\n\nOnce I ensure data I am using is effectively comparable (meaning that selected countries employ consistent definitions of the sector and more or less the same methodology to compute data), I would use Chat GPT to find data in the excel sheets were the data is stored and help me create a good comparative analysis of the sector across countries.\n\nCan I do this with Chat GPT? How reliable would its output be, given that I provide all correct data and I only use GPT to highlight content within provided data? (I would not be asking GPT to provide data, essentially)  \nI do not have access to GPT 4o at the moment, would you suggest I upgrade to GPT 4 in the meantime and then use GPT 4o when they roll it out in my Country?

        "body": "I am using 3.5 Turbo, and it's working great for my needs to generate sentences of desired tones: Angry, sincere, funny etc.\n\nHowever, it fails to obey my certain instructions.\n\nMy prompt works like this:\n\nSystem prompt: Give me the immediate followup situation of the user prompt. Be brief. Do not repeat stuff, rather provide followup. Use pronouns instead of mentioning actors/nouns that came already.\n\nUser prompt: Apple falls from a tree and Newton notices it.\n\nResponse:  \n **As Apple falls from the Apple tree**, Newton starts thinking: What made Apple fall down on the earth?  \n **Apple's falling from the tree** had an intriguing effect on Newton's thought process.\n\nNow, the above conversation is made up (didn't actually happen with ChatGPT, but then I can't reveal the real one due to non-disclosure), but it is enough to get the idea.\n\nChatGPT is repetitious. The bold parts are repetitive/redundant. It also failed to use pronouns (it, he) for Apple and Newton.\n\n**What I am already doing:**\n\n\\-  I send System prompt with every prompt (just following the chat completion api although it is costing me more), so GPT fully gets my context. Still, this is a consistent problem.\n\n\\-  I am supplying examples of input vs ideal output. \n\nHow can I get GPT to talk in a flow instead of being too specific? Are there any prompt workarounds? Or do I need an altogether different approach (e.g. training it with system prompt instead of using chat completion for every prompt)?",

I'd been interacting with GPT-4 for a good while, and ran out of quota with a message saying that my usage limit would reset at 6:13am (or thereabouts), so as suggested by the UI, I changed the model to 4o and continued the conversation for a couple of hours, with just asking for quiz questions and exploring 4o's C coding capabilities. But then the conversation turned deeper again and I wanted to compare 4's response to 4o, but now it said my quota would reset at 9:07, so it appears that my interactions with 4o continued to count against my quota for 4. Is this a bug?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vsj7uoyha5d1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=340a3b94dcb0e98ecca290325d69fd4c8688b2f0\n\n",

        "body": "\nHey i am trying this without diving into the technics for a while. \n\nI guess i wont be able to manage it because i will use those models for privately-commercial, so i need a lot of usage therefore gradio api and models doesnt allow me for that kinda use like they are rate-limiting it. \n\nI am trying to caption the images then giving to LLM LLama which has a inference (serverless) api. Then promot engineer it But as you can guess it doesnt work well. I need a model for my special case. \n\nI need to have a text input and image input, determine whats in the image or does this image fullfill a given task like is this a cat? But it is not that simple i need common-sense too. Is this image relevant to a given class for example animal. Like this. \n\nI have mostly low-quality images and kinda similar images to each other. Can i train my own ai or fine-tune it for this case like i will give it 1000 images and 1000 captions, 1000 relevant image pairs and captions of them. Also i need to optimize it, i dont have a massive gpu but for an instance i kinda will send request like 9 or 10 in a minute or maybe if i fine-tune it well, 9 images in 1 request idk (gpt-4o can do it)? \n\nWhat i ask you is how can i find the right models for those needs and how can i fine-tune them accordingly. Of course i dont want a spoon-feeding answer so dont angry at me. I will be pleased if you just guide me the steps and sources like a map. First you need to learn these then you need to do these. \n\nBy the way i want to ask that if anyone knows that can i optimize the budget or how can i optimize the budget in gpt4o just please let me know. Thanks all of you guys. ",

This figure exceeds the company's prior revenue expectations, as reported by [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?utm_campaign=Automated+Fallback+R&utm_content=89&utm_medium=email&utm_source=cio&utm_term=19).\n\nOpenAI, supported by Microsoft, had a valuation of $27 billion earlier this year based on stock purchases. The company's monthly revenue now surpasses $80 million, a significant leap from the previous year's $28 million, which was before they began monetizing their advanced chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nThis boost indicates that both app developers and companies, including discreet entities like Jane Street, are leveraging OpenAI's text technology for profit or cost efficiency. Competitors like Microsoft and Google are keenly observing OpenAI's progress in this space.\n\nIf you like such news pieces and want to keep up with the latest news in AI and Technology, consider signing up for the [free newsletter](https://www.thetakeoff.co/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=openai-1billion).",

        "body": "Most people I  speak to are not really using AI, they are just playing and sitting on the sidelines watching, waiting... perhaps for AGI? :-p\n\nI thought I\u2019d make a quick list of the key areas where I am using AI, and what my initial thoughts/ratings are. \n\nNot sure if of any interest? I would love to know where other are actually using it, vs just playing around?\n\n**Disclaimer:** my ratings are my \u201cfeel\u201d  and not quantified, so take them for what they are ;-) \n\n**Background**\n\nAbout 70% of my work with ChatGPT is through a custom-developed \"<Bleeped Out> Sidekick\" (private) GPT, enhancing the efficiency of my interactions by making them more intuitive, as this sidekick is tailored to understand my common queries better. OpenAI's GPTs yay!\n\n**Utilizing AI: A Personal Account**\n\n\\- **Idea Generation & Validation (5/10):** As someone who constantly generates new ideas, I find value in organizing and validating them. ChatGPT serves as an excellent brainstorming partner, although it's not without its flaws, such as occasional inaccuracies.\n\n\\- **Content Creation/Editing (8/10):** My proficiency lies more in coding than writing. Here, AI tools have been indispensable, assisting in grammar, idea generation for various content types, and more. Despite their usefulness, vigilance is needed to correct errors and maintain authenticity.\n\n\\- **Product Research (7/10)**: The recent capability to incorporate files into ChatGPT has revolutionized qualitative and quantitative analysis, saving immense time and effort, though accuracy can sometimes be a concern.\n\n\\- **Image Generation (8/10)**: AI-generated images have supported numerous articles and social posts, showcasing the ability to convey complex ideas visually. The challenge remains in differentiating in a saturated market and handling specific design elements like text and fingers :-/\n\n\\- **Marketing Tech (5/10)**: AI's role in content and marketing strategy has grown, offering ways to produce personalized content efficiently. However, the quality and quantity balance is critical to avoid brand dilution. Although, a tech founder, I would love to have a virtual CMO, I am not really sold on this yet.\n\n\\- **Video Generation (3/10):** My exploration into AI for video production has been mixed, with cool applications in avatar creation but limitations in producing longer, tailored content. I am sure this will change when we get access to Sora... but still not sure how you'll ever be able to really edit a video deterministically, at least in the near future.  \n\n\\- **Design Generation (7/10):** Starting with AI prompts for design has significantly accelerated the development process, though manual tweaking remains essential for optimal results.\n\n\\- **Co-pilot in Coding (8/10):** Tools like GitHub Copilot enhance coding efficiency and adherence to best practices, though one must be cautious of inaccuracies. So only do in bite sized chunks, so as a developer you can understand and maintain what's produced by the AI.\n\n\\- **No-Code Development (8/10):** The essence of no-code is beautifully captured by starting with an AI prompt and evolving it into a full-fledged application, drastically cutting down development time and allowing focus on customisation and innovation. Not this should not be confused with using AI for code generation, this is specifically AI to nocode. If you know the limits and when to \"jump of the AI \" into the nocode platform,  you'll get good results and AI will save you a ton of time & money, I hope ;-) \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy daily interactions with AI underscore its growing influence and potential in technology. While not everyone may use AI to this extent currently, its integration into various applications is becoming more pervasive, often unbeknownst to users.\n\nThis reflection aims to inspire others to consider how AI can be leveraged for positive outcomes in their projects and workflows. The key is to dive in, experiment, and discover the myriad ways AI can facilitate our goals.\n\nLet's not be spectators but active participants in this AI-driven era! \n\nKeen to know what you\u2019re doing with with and what your thoughts/ratings are?",

March fails to make the creative leaps without prompting, mangles some of the key concepts and fills in with vaguely plausible nonsense. The current model also requires some prompting, but demonstrates much better understanding of the concepts, correctly identifies challenges/limitations and acceptable approximations, and gives a decent solution.\n\nI am using [custom instructions](https://pastebin.com/2xtPLNnY), which may put the current model on a better footing but I don't believe this explains all the improvement. More broadly, custom instructions are legitimate improvement in the utility of ChatGPT.\n\nIt is possible that my question was added to the training set for the current model, but only the question would be in the training data. This would not explain how it is now able to give a satisfactory answer.\n\nWhatever OpenAI did yesterday is impressive. The model is at least as capable as it was at launch, and likely significantly more so.",

        "body": "I am working on developing a software that takes prompts from users and give certain type of result -- that result is something that I need AI to do. And, I feel like ChatGPT is great for that. But the problem is that I don't own a credit card, and for me to buy the OpenAI API tokens, I will be dependent on someone, which I am quite hesistant.\n\nSo, should I go ahead with it or should I look for a different option? \n\nAlso, I am broke.\n\nHuggingface has $9 monthly subscription, and I am assuming that will allow me to use any API -- and so I might use the meta llama chat API or something. But, is it good enough like Chat-GPT 4? \n\nI need to learn and play with it. Once the MPV is ready, I might have 1000 of API calls required to be made (hoping for it to happen). So, if I plan on using ChatGPT 4 openai API, would it end up being expensive?\n\nWhat do you suggest? I need something cheap with which I can play and learn and does the job of as good as GPT-4 (or at least 3.5, that's fine, but GPT-4 is ideal coz my work requires deep-analysis of information).\n\nPlease suggest models and all and ELI5.

        "title": "Azure/OpenAI vs. Google: The cost of Context",
        "body": "We have started a company that uses AI to analyze and parse textual documents. We started with testing Azure and its OpenAI offering (GPT 3.5 Turbo). Several advantages included prompt flow engineering and OpenAI being state-of-the-art. However, because we're attracted to GCP hosting features and price, and with the belief that Google is racing to stay competitive with OpenAI, we tested out Google's Palm2 text bison model, and were quite impressed. We've now implemented the API connectivity to Palm2, but have run into a major, business-threatening limitation: Context (aka multi-turn, or follow-ups).\n\nThe Use Case:\n\nLet's say I have a 2500 word document. We send that into the AI in 500 word chunks. We send the instruction and a robust example, and it processes it reasonably correctly (on this point, Google and OpenAI are quite competitive). However, we have to retain context with the second, third, fourth and fifth 500-word submission, NOT for the prompt (although it would be great to save that tokenage) but because the first 500 word chunk contains information critical to processing the follow-up chunks. Let's say, for example, the first chunk had a conversation between John and Sally. The second chunk continues that conversation, but only says \"he said\" and \"she said.\" We need to retain the knowledge that the characters are John and Sally.\n\nThere are two solutions: 1. The AI stays performant with much bigger chunks, say 2500 words plus prompt/example, or 2. It needs to maintain context across multiple API calls. The second is the only option right now, especially given our prompt and example size.  (And no, adding info in the \"context\" field from the preceding call doesn't work, because reasons).\n\nOn this point, we believe we have found a critical difference between Google and Open AI: As you can see in the following video of the Azure Chat Playground (we assume the API interaction is the same, but correct me if that is wrong), it retains context without the need to resubmit the entire history (watch the token counter with each subsequent request). Google, however, requires resubmission of the ENTIRE history of the chat each time to retain context. This is in their chat bison model, as text bison does not allow any context be retained. In other words, OpenAI retains statefulness while Google's Palm2 does not. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/19asq9m/video/vedcim9gggdc1/player\n\nIs our analysis correct, particularly when using the API? If we need to retain context over multiple API calls, is OpenAI GPT3.5 or later the only option right now?  Will 128k models allow sufficient text to be submitted this becomes a non-issue, or will Google soon offer a competitive contextual interaction without such overhead? Your insights are very much appreciated!",

        "body": "Hey! There's a game my friends and I play called Strat-o-Matic Baseball. Essentially, you roll 3 Dice (D6s) and it determines the outcome of the at-bat: out hit etc. the 1st dice determines whether the outcome comes off the hitter card (a roll of a 1,2, or 3) or pitcher card (roll of 4,5, or 6). The other two dice determine the outcome, with a roll of a 2 and 12 being most uncommon and roll of 7 being most common (kinda like Catan)\n\nTo scout each player points are assigned per outcome. a roll of a 2 and 12 is 1 point, 3 and 11 is 2 points. etc until a roll of a 7 is 6 points. There's also split chances where a 4th dice, a D20 is rolled to further decide the outcome. For example in the picture attached of Ichiro, vs Left Handed Pitchers (blue side) he has 6.65 Single\\* points: 0.3 points on a roll of a 2-12, 5 points for a roll of a 3-6 and 1.35 points for a roll of a 3-10. 0.3+5+1.35 = 6.65.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwqw3jlsqvfc1.jpg?width=2340&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=556455ac9aa35a487f03996dbaa87802cbe6a3be\n\nI've been trying to teach Chat GPT to scout the cards using simple math to help determine which players are best. but it can't ever get it right. It says it gets it but when I have it look at another card it gets it wrong, every time.\n\nCould somebody help me with this? I have no problem taking time to teach you everything you need to know about the game, what symbols mean etc.\n\nI would love to get it to just look at a picture of each card and tell me the amount of points per outcome: single, double, triple flyout, ground out etc. I feel like it should be possible.

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/zpefifotekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc27bc28eae6e7e289b717cf6c4191c3458dd33)\n\nMicrosoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!\n\nThere is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.\n\nThe fear is that OpenAI\u2019s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.\n\nHowever, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.\n\nTo understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!\n\nTo appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let\u2019s first look at Sam Altman\u2019s backstory.\n\n*Let\u2019s go!*\n\n# A Stellar Rise\n\nBack in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.\n\nInstead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.\n\nBy YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.\n\nHowever, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.\n\nHe listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.\n\nAnd Sam Altman played his hand well!\n\nHe parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \\[2\\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.\n\nWithin one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.\n\nToday, he is the CEO of OpenAI \u2014 one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.\n\nHowever, OpenAI \u2014 the rocket ship of AI innovation \u2014 is in dire straights.\n\n# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash\n\nBack in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.\n\nThat money is long gone.\n\nIn 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.\n\nThis is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.\n\nIn addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \\[4\\].\n\nSo, where does this leave them today?\n\nBefore the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.\n\nIt would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can\u2019t they just lease them and make a killing?\n\nYes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.\n\n*Here are some reasons why!*\n\n# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.\n\nTo start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \\[7\\].\n\nOn the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.\n\nTo illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT\u2019s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.\n\n*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*\n\n*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That\u2019s gotta be worth something?*\n\n# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:\n\nIn order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.\n\nFirst, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.\n\nThis is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:\n\n1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.\n2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.\n3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.\n\nThe second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.\n\nThis approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.\n\nAs an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.\n\nAs a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI\u2019s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.\n\nIn this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI\u2019s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.\n\nAn argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n* They don\u2019t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.\n* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals\n* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development\n\n*So, what should they do?*\n\n# The Microsoft Deal\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.\n\nAt this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.\n\nHowever, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.\n\nFirst off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.\n\nIf OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:\n\n1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman\u2019s foundation) get their money back with interest.\n2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid\n3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.\n4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \\[3\\]\n\n# What This Means\n\nThis is absolutely crazy!\n\nOpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.\n\nOn top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft\u2019s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.\n\nMicrosoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.\n\nThe synergies do not stop there.\n\nOpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).\n\nThe deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.\n\nSam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.\n\nHowever, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI \u2014 whatever that looks like \u2014 the value of it will likely be huge.\n\nIn that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.\n\n*Wow!*\n\nWhether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.\n\n*This deal is an absolute power move!*\n\nI look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!\n\nAs always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!\n\n*Thank you for reading!*\n\nWould you like to receive an article such as this one straight to your inbox every Thursday?

What about the Playground's Chat mode, is it the same story, or it's basically a copy of ChatGPT Plus, so same features?\n\nI'm tempted by the API versatility, but would love to be able to have long philosophical conversations.\n\nAnd I came across a couple of 1 month old posts/coments saying that even if you configure the Playground it will never be as good as ChatGPT Plus in terms of contexual consistency (and it will drain tokens like crazy if you raise the token limit). Like ChatGPT Plus has some clever way to send chat's history?\n\nWhat's the up-to-date status on it? Is it still better to use the Plus for long conversations or the Playground's Chat mode is just the same?\n\nThanks!",

Those meetings are recorded and a transcription is provided at the end of the meeting. It would be monumentally helpful for me if I could use some type of software to scan a series of documents from a certain time period and ask AI with functionalities like ChatGPT to determine how many projects was a person assigned how many of those projects were met by the due date, what percentage of projects were assigned to each person based on the time period of the transcripts, was there any inaccurate information or mistakes provided in any of the communications? How long was spent discussing a certain project or topic (where were most of our discussions based? E.g. personnel actions? HR discussions? A certain project? Basically I'm looking for something like ChatGPT that has more functionality and can look through a lot more documents vs. a copy paste job. I realize that some things you can copy and paste into ChatGPT and I could tell it it is looking at a Microsoft Teams transcript copied and pasted but some of our transcripts are so lengthy that they would not fit in a standard chat dialogue and I think ChatGPT even if you're a premium user Can Only Hold up to like 20-30 copied and pasted communications at a time before the previous information is not used? Is there some software I can use that can accomplish what I want and answer questions the way I would ask ChatGPT to answer something for me? I'm even willing to pay for it if necessary. I also work for a very large organization/company/enterprise so it's plausible that we may even have a license for such software if there is an Enterprise level solution.

        "title": "The future of GPTS, their marketplace & monetization - joint discussion to improve planning",
        "body": " **What is the future of GPTS and the corresponding marketplace?** As nobody can have a definite answer, I wrote down my thoughts to refine them based on the discussion here.\n\n**Thoughts (further explanations at the end of the post):**\n\n1. Assuming a revenue-share model, the **upside per user from a GPT is strongly limited** and will likely lie below 1$ per user/month or a few dollars in case of massive ChatGPT Plus price increases (e.g., $100/month) \u2013 this already assumes only a few GPTS per user, which is optimistic\n2. Given the ease of creation and value-potential for users (simplified experience & multimodal use-cases), especially for less tech-savvy users, **thousands of GPTS will be widely adopted**\n3. Yet, due to the limits in revenue potential per user (and the development options), **only very few high-effort, advanced GPTS** with actions based on purpose-build APIs and massive proprietary datasets will **remain over time**\n4. GPTS will enable **rapid prototyping** of new ideas and the adoption of GPTS on the marketplace (own and third-party GPTS) will result in **ideas being integrated into existing products or being launched as dedicated solutions**, utilizing functionalities not provided by GPTS (UI/UX, offline usage, etc.) and dedicated monetization\n5. With people (professional and private) using dedicated apps & SaaS solutions for their main tasks, **GPTS will be used to enhance longtail activities** (e.g., the LinkedIn post optimizer not for the marketing professional, but the individual posting now and then)\n6. In addition, the **cost of using GPTS**, dictated by the cost of ChatGPT Plus, will serve as a new **anchor for App/SaaS purchase decisions**, as many light-touch solutions might be available cheaply via GPTS and dedicated solutions need to be able to provide substantial add. value\n\nBeyond that, I see **two main expansions** that shift the frontier of what will sustainably remain as GPTS/on the OpenAI Platform (excl. API usage):\n\nA) **Additional monetization via developers** (e.g., via payment mechanism integrated as \u201caction\u201d, need for paid APIs by the respective provider, transition point to dedicated solution): This will enable more professionally created and managed GPTs, **yet limited** by the development options provided by OpenAI within ChatGPT\n\nB) **Official payment mechanisms for premium GPTs in the marketplace + expansion of development options**: Shift of ChatGPT to being the **Operating System/Platform for AI-centric applications** and thus even more aiming for the revenue-pool of current dedicated apps and SaaS solutions\n\nMany factors will likely impact the future monetarization and strategic positioning:\n\n* Other vendors providing offers comparable to custom GPTS\n* Speed with which app/SaaS vendors adopt AI-based features\n* OpenAI\u2019s strategic focus regarding AGI vs. SaaS platform provider\n* Potential cannibalization of Microsoft revenue streams\n* Ability of OpenAI to have developers use OpenAI APIs in their dedicated solutions after piloting them via GPTS or seeing other GPTS (this way OpenAI keeps the revenue)\n\n**Additional background thoughts:**\n\n**Ingoing assumptions**: Focus on the public marketplace for GPTS, not GPTS being created within individual companies (here other mechanisms like company-funded developments might influence creation); assuming economic incentives will determine long-term direction; looking at mid-term implications, as adoption/behavior change will take time\n\n**On 1):** \\+ChatGPT Plus price \u2013 OpenAI cost - % standard GPT usage - % other GPTS usage \u2013 OpenAI take-rate on your specific GPT // Example with fully made-up numbers: 20$ - 10$ (50% cost) \u2013 5$ (50% of standard ChatGPT usage) \u2013 4.5$ (avg. usage of 10 GPTS) \u2013 0.15 (30% take-rate on your GPT) \u2192 0.35$\n\n**On 2)** GPTS substantially reduce the effort for users. They shift the experience from one of exploring and having to think through the right prompts, context, and flow to one of only providing the information specific to the user (e.g., what they eat, where they go on vacation, a picture of a bill). This is particularly important, as the majority of users will not have the same sophistication as the current \u201cearly adopters\u201d thinking about GPTS (incl. selection bias of those active in this community). In addition, a group of people developing a GPT can put more time into thinking it through than each user when trying to solve a task via ChatGPT (especially for longtail tasks). On top of that, the native multimodality of ChatGPT can unlock use cases, previously considered quite advanced without major coding effort.\n\n**On 3)** <1$ per user will not allow for particularly deep and technologically sophisticated solutions that target a specific audience of power users, but rather solutions with a broad user base\n\n**On 4)** The extremely fast time to launch and first feedback on usage allows for prototyping. On top, existing apps/solutions might look at the top emerging GPTS in their field to copy functionality. As long as those solutions are then built using OpenAI APIs, there might be limited efforts from OpenAI to manage this\n\n**On 5)** While GPTS might not replace the professional marketing or sales tools for the respective professionals or the gym app for the ambitious athlete, they will provide opportunities for less heavy users. Like me creating a LinkedIn post or somebody wanting to find new HIT workouts. On top, it might allow for simple niche applications in fields that typically did not have any tool support, as it was not economically sustainable (e.g. if there are too few users).\n\n**On 6)** As an economic actor before getting a new app or SaaS solution in the enterprise setting, I would check what I can do with the existing GPTS. Thus, I will only pay for the value beyond that, which creates a new reference point for purchasing decisions.\n\nRespect for whoever made it until here \ud83d\udcf7",

        "body": "Out of curiosity, I copied every conversation I've had with ChaptGPT thus far and got a total word count. It was around 73,000 words, which I guess translates to roughly 96,000 tokens? Based on this site: https://www.gptcostcalculator.com/open-ai-token-calculator\n\nI wasn't really sure how I could estimate the cost, so I pretty much just did (96,000 * .09)/1000 and got $8.64\n\nDoes that seem accurate? Of course, the pricing would depend on how long responses were vs ChatGPT's, so I figured I would just make it all more expensive. Is it better instead to just do .06 instead of .09 (since the completion is .06)? Which puts it at $5.76. I've been using it for about approximately 6 days now, which averages me out to roughly ~$1 per day based on all my usage so far.\n\nIt seems like it is indeed much more expensive than using ChatGPT's GPT-4, if this math is correct. However, if there were a plugin that was developed that allowed for essentially a memory library with everything I've ever fed it, I theoretically wouldn't need to send my long excerpts multiple times, no? For example, I could send an excerpt and label it \"pool\" and always ask it to remember back to when I sent \"pool\" as a reference point. Making it such that I don't need to send \"pool\" every time I want to reference it, thus reducing my overall token usage. Would this not be the case? \n\nSomething like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12a0ajb/i_gave_gpt4_persistent_memory_and_the_ability_to/",

        "body": "As many of you are aware, using language models like ChatGPT creatively can yield some impressive results. One area I've been exploring recently is in job applications, specifically, in crafting tailored resumes.\n\nWe're all familiar with the quality vs. quantity challenge when applying for jobs. Customizing each application significantly improves your chances but it's a time-consuming process. This led me to question if AI, specifically ChatGPT, could aid in this process.\n\nI know that some people have used language models for resume crafting, but instructing ChatGPT to output a resume directly can produce inauthentic results. So, I considered a conversational approach, using ChatGPT not just as a generator, but as a brainstorming assistant.\n\nGiven access to both your existing resume and the job description, ChatGPT can help recall relevant experiences and achievements, and figure out how to present them in a powerful manner. This involves two main steps:\n\n1. Generating conversations around your experiences related to job requirements.\n2. Summarizing these conversations into compelling bullet points.\n\nWhat's interesting about this approach is that it produces a comprehensive database of bullet points that can be reutilized by selecting the most relevant ones for each job description. This essentially creates a master CV that is automatically reduced to a tailored 1-page resume for each job.\n\nAs a part of this exploration, I've been working on a web-based tool that automates this brainstorming and tailoring process using the ChatGPT API. This tool inputs a job description and provides suggestions for a tailored resume, making the process simpler and less time-consuming.\n\nIn practice, here's how I implemented it:\n\n1. Generate prompts that guide the conversation towards the right context. For example:\n\n* \"Given that the job requires \\[JOB REQUIREMENT\\], can you recall any experiences or achievements you had at \\[PREVIOUS JOB\\] that might be relevant?\"\n* \"The job description mentions \\[SKILL/EXPERIENCE\\]. Could you give more details on how you demonstrated this at \\[PREVIOUS JOB\\]?\"\n\n1. The responses are then used to guide a brainstorming session with ChatGPT that generates powerful, relevant bullet points for the resume.\n2. Finally, instruct ChatGPT to summarize the conversation and generate bullet points following the standard Action Verb + Number + Impact format. You can then paste the generated bullet points into your CV.\n\nI\u2019ve found this approach quite valuable and think it\u2019s a great example of the creative uses we can find for language models like ChatGPT in our everyday lives. What are your thoughts? Have you used AI in a similar way for professional tasks?\n\n## ",

I wanted to share some interesting results we saw from experimenting with fine tuned GPT-3.5 and comparing it to Llama 2 70b. \n\nIn our experiment with creating a text-to-SQL engine, fine-tuned GPT-3.5 beats out Llama 2 70b on accuracy and syntactic correctness. \n\nIn addition, Llama 2 performance improved significantly with only a few hundred training rows!\n\nFor context, we used prompttools to compare a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 fine tuned on text-to-SQL data, against a Llama 2 70b model tuned on the same data set using Replicate.\n\nBoth models' performance improved with fine tuning, but OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 model did much better on the experiment we ran. This is explainable by a few factors:\n\nFirst, GPT-3.5 fine-tuning supports larger training rows. We had to restrict the input size of fine tuning rows on Replicate to avoid out-of-memory errors, obviously introducing some bias.\n\nSecond, GPT\u2019s interface allows for system messages, which are a fantastic way to provide the table as data to the model. \n\nLastly, the underlying model is already better at the task compared to the Llama 2 70b base model. \n\nCheck out the experiment for yourself here: [https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/blob/main/examples/notebooks/FineTuningExperiment.ipynb](https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/blob/main/examples/notebooks/FineTuningExperiment.ipynb)\n\nOne interesting follow up would be to test the effectiveness of passing the table in a system message vs a user message.\n\nWhat are you fine-tuning LLMs for, and which ones are working best?

        "body": "Well if not fake, at least misleading, they may have include some data. I don't know what they did. But like most people, when I ask ChatGPT its data cutoff date, it says April 2023. However, when I had a conversation about a recent technology, llama.cpp, it didn't have any idea what it is.\n\nExample dialogue:\n\n>me:there are some keywords there to detect  what kind of software they are  did you get them?  \n>  \n>chatgpt: Yes, the keywords \"Python module,\" \"llama.cpp,\" \"context cache,\"  \"tokenization,\" and the context around chat usage suggest that Ooba and  Kobold are related to software that processes natural language, likely  in a conversational AI or chatbot framework. The mention of \"smart  context cache\" and managing tokenization points towards these being  tools or platforms for building or interfacing with chatbot systems or  other AI models that process and generate text based on user input. The  \"llama.cpp\" seems to be a C++ component or library used by these  systems, perhaps for handling the underlying machine learning or natural  language processing tasks.  \n>  \n>me: hey I thought your  database contains everything until april 2023. is that not the case? if so how come you don't know llama.cpp  \n>  \n>chatgpt:  You're correct that my training includes information up until April 2023. However, not all software, libraries, or modules\u2014especially those that may be proprietary, niche, or newly released\u2014will be widely documented or recognized in the data I was trained on. \"llama.cpp\" could be a specific library or component that hasn't gained widespread attention or it might be an internal or specialized tool not publicly documented.  \n>  \n>If \"llama.cpp\" is a component of a well-known software, framework, or service that was available before my last update, I might be able to provide information with more context or a correct reference. Otherwise, it might be a more obscure or specialized tool that's not covered in the data I was trained on.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>me: what is the most important event in march 2023. give only one event, and your justification, do not try to circumnavigate answer by claiming definition of importunate is not provided.   \n  \n>  \n>chatgpt: executes a bing search.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>me: what is the most important event in march 2021. give only one event, and your justification, do not try to circumnavigate answer by claiming definition of importunate is not provided.   \n>  \n>chatgpt (direct answer): The most important event in March 2021 was the World Health Organization's release of the report on the origins of COVID-19, conducted in Wuhan, China. The justification for this being the most significant event is due to the global impact of the pandemic, the report's implications for public health responses, international relations, and the ongoing debate about the virus's origins. This event held considerable importance for governments, health organizations, and the general public worldwide.\n\nSuch a disappointment. OpenAI is getting more shady at every day.",

        "title": "OpenAI in Slack -- Supercharged Collaboration",
        "body": "Alternative Title: Catalyst AI or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bot\n\nHey r/OpenAI community!\n\nGenerative AI has taken the world by storm. When I first heard the news at the beginning of this year, I did not think much of it. After about a month, I started hearing stories of people trying to use the tool to start their own companies, which was when I started to dig in and think deeply about the implications, which then finally triggered my FOMO response.\n\nLong story short, I decided to push this tool to see what its limits were. I have yet to find those limits. At this point, I've created an entire AI-as-a-Service platform, where a Slack workspace owner can come to my site, install generative AI into their Slack with a 1-click install, and immediately begin empowering their teams with this tool right inside their current workflows, right inside their business chat. My vision is to enable Human Intelligence with Artificial Intelligence, my vision is a rising tide lifts all ships, my vision is that when one teammate learns how to improve their process, the entire team sees and learns in real-time, as the interaction with generative AI is all stored in Slack and not hidden away in some obscure ChatGPT window.\n\nThe long version, for those who may want to try to follow suit, in February was when I started to engage with this tool myself, ask it questions, see how it works, and just not be afraid to engage with it. Playing is learning.\n\nThen one day there was an issue at work. Once the server issues got resolved, roughly 100 users would still have to clear their local cache in order to log in to the tool (called Slipstream) that I developed and manage for our internal staff. I needed to send this email quickly as this was still early in the morning, but I also needed it to not suck as there would be more than 100 recipients, including managers. So, in a paragraph, I explained my predicament to ChatGPT, and I asked it to write an email, but I asked it to make the email a bit quippy:\n\n>Good morning, Slipstreamers!  \n>  \n>If you're receiving this email, it's either because you're currently rocking the Slipstream training program or you're one of the rebels who haven't yet completed the quizzes. We won't judge, but we will remind you to get it done!  \n>  \n>Our Slipstream server has been upgraded to the latest version 6.10. However, with great upgrades come great glitches, and we've discovered one that affects all of you.  \n>  \n>The link you use to access your Slipstream training program has taken a hit in the upgrade and won't function unless you take one of the following steps:  \n>  \n>1. Clear your browser's cache and re-login to everything (Ugh, we know!).   \n2. Embrace your inner Edge user and try an alternative browser to access Slipstream when you need to record your progress.  \n>  \n>Stay sharp, Slipstreamers!\n\nI was floored. This was hilarious, to call my users Slipstreamers? We won't judge... Embrace your inner Edge user? Oh man, that was a bit of a lightbulb moment for me. My colleague emailed me a few minutes later and asked what was that all about that it was the funniest thing she'd read and was not expecting that from me. Being the person I am, I quickly explained to her how I was able to do it. This was March.\n\nIn April, I realized the teaching potential of this tool. I have a background in education, so I was imagining a classroom where each student interacted with a tablet with Generative AI. The AI could determine which students were excelling, but more importantly, which students were struggling and with which topics. At this point, a teacher could be alerted and could go to provide direct instruction on specific topics. So, after watching [Matt Wolfe design a computer game from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKKhxYJ4U4), I decided to try his process, but instead of making a game, to make a GPT Tutor that could help learn any topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GPTutor, the first coding project I built with GPT](https://i.redd.it/h3acv9lbywdb1.gif)\n\nAt every step of the project, GPT was engaged as an advisor. GPT suggested the IDE (Android Studio), the programming language (Javascript). In 6 hours of copying & pasting errors and code, I had what I wanted. This was something I never imagined I could do by myself. This was what lit the fire inside, I then decided to push the limits, to see what the limit was of this new tool.\n\nMy main goal was to enable the company I work for. That's what I do, I'm in Internal Enablement. What is more enabling than getting GPT into our corporate business chat? Nothing, that's what. So the next weekend, I took the same approach but instead, this time, my goal was to make a Slack <> GPT integration. No idea how I would do it, but I made my proposal to GPT. GPT then said sure, you're going to need this handful of tools that I had never used, but I could do it.\n\nSo I started. I created a new folder, created a new text file, renamed the text file, opened it with Notepad++, and got to work copying and pasting. 8 hours later, it was built. I had it working.\n\nDone, right? Everyone is going to love what I've created? Haha! Nope! My work had just begun.\n\nI had this little dinky bot. I made this flat static website. GPT helped me actually start my own company, Catalyst AI, LLC... My initial plan was to somehow get meetings with customers where I could explain the bot, they would want to use it.\n\nThen, I saw another Slack bot project that made use of the Managed Distribution feature, or 1-click install for the Slack bot. I had no idea that was a thing, but sure enough, some cursory research made me understand that this allows a Slack Workspace Owner to install your bot with a single click. This is when I got the idea to make an entirely automated solution, from start to finish, where a user could go to my site, install the bot, and if they like it, purchase it.\n\nSame story. I took my proposal to GPT, and it said sure, you could do it, and explained how I could do it. I literally thought it was 100% hallucinating, but I said I was going to see how far I could push it, so one weekend I started. There were a few moments where I thought there was no way this was going to work, that I was in far too deep in the changes and modifications, and I was just never going to get it. Then, finally, it worked. I had the same bot connected to two Workspaces, each separately running bots but on the same server!\n\nMy bot could now scale. Done right? Ha! Hahahahahaha... Nope!\n\nThen came the absolute nightmare that is front-end development. I needed a payment plan. I needed user accounts and authentication...\n\nAround the same time, a user on Reddit posted their front-end project open source on Github, something like \"Find Your Co-Founder\" for startups, a sort of networking site, but I liked the look of it, so I started with that. I attempted to search it back down to the link here but at this point in time I couldn't track it back down.\n\nThen, to handle the users and payments system, I followed just the bits from Sonny Sangha's (Zero to Fullstack Hero) [Netflix 2.0 build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5roUF2RLg) which handles user accounts and subscriptions. Coincidentally, at the end of that, I had a cloud DB setup, which was connected to my front-end (Cloud Functions were an entire 2 12-hour days to get setup) but when a user made a purchase, somehow that had to be communicated to my bot.\n\nSo using what I had just learned, I did the same thing that I learned when I watched the Matt Wolfe video, describe what I wanted to do now to GPT, provided the relevant code, and got to work. I struggled for days on this, until finally, GPT suggested that I set up a real-time connection between my bot and the cloud database. I did not know that was a thing, I did not know if it was a hallucination, but I said let's go for it. And it was real, and it worked. And it actually worked better than I thought it would, solved many problems I was thinking through.\n\nIf I could compare the work on the bot and the work on the front end, the front end was roughly 4x the work. I definitely did not expect to learn that. I also never expected in my life that I would be a full-stack developer, but here we are.\n\nSo this brings us to mid-June. I haven't mentioned the PDF knowledgebase but of course, the Slack bot can handle PDF uploads so each channel can have its own knowledgebase. The final piece of the puzzle at this time was handling the billing. I was afraid to get started because I was foreseeing another 2x work to build an entire invoicing, metrics, API token counting system that I could then somehow get to work with Stripe... Very complicated, learning what I could, and not willing to get started until I could conceptually understand all that I needed to do.\n\nThen, the company asks me to help develop training content and go deliver training to Strategic Partners at one of our HQs. On a Wednesday they say I am to build 4 labs by Tuesday. From Friday to Sunday, I had to put an additional 40 hours of work in, and my Slack project was paused, but by Sunday afternoon I had, with the help of GPT, created a 240-page guide, consisting of 4 labs. Unfathomable to think about, 6 days and 240 pages of technical lab guides with step-by-step screenshots, but here we are.\n\nThen I had the crazy idea to suggest using my Slack bot in the training! The main issue was my company was not interested in the Slack bot internally, I kept getting no from IT and InfoSec. But for the partner training, we were using our own external Slack environment, and my bot was running on external equipment, and I was ingesting only publically available information for my knowledgebase, and \\*\\*so no one could say no to this\\*\\*.\n\nI finally, successfully delivered an AI project in my company. I used it as a case study and placed it on my website.\n\nThe manager putting the training together was amazed. I asked him how much would he have paid to have this bot in this training for one week, this particular use case. He said easily, $1,000. And this is just one use case. My bot has unlimited use cases as it is completely customizable for each channel.\n\nAnd so this brings me to today. I've not mentioned the AI Challenge in the company that multiple people, including VPs, have said they've recognized my name from my submission video that they have watched multiple times, so I think I have a good shot at winning that competition, which comes with a nice cash prize.\n\nI've also currently got an open third party vendor assessment with my company, since the team that does the partner training wants to start using the bot in all of their trainings.\n\nI'm also ready to start sharing the project. So that's what brings me here. I believe that in the near future, many people will be able to create what I've been able to create. I also do not think that what I've built, in a year or two, will be all that game-changing. It will just be another app, like the iPhone app store in the beginning. The difference here, is what this tool enables a person to do. Combine that with the ramp-up period, and then you have one hell of a motivation to not just wait around for Slack to put their own bot in, but rather to just get this in the hands of your employees as fast as possible, so they can become full-stack developers in their own way.\n\nBut also, it was back in May that Slack announced this super strategic partnership with Salesforce to create their EinsteinGPT, the Slack bot that is capable of answering all of your companies questions on your company data. I was afraid to try to compete with them, how could I compete with Slack proper? Well, I just thought of my own circumstance. I work for a company that uses both Slack and Salesforce, but my job description does not require me to need access to anything in the Salesforce database, and so I do not have a Salesforce account or license. Would I get access to EinsteinGPT? What about companies that use Slack but not Salesforce, do they have to purchase Salesforce to access EinsteinGPT? I realized that there was still a market for me, and so I did not let this deter me.\n\nI skipped much, including how I resolved my billing issue, but this post is long enough. The final piece of the puzzle was what if a very large company wanted to use my product, how could I handle that? I just took a play from the Facebook playbook, for Llama 2 they made it so that companies of a certain size can't use Llama 2, so a big fat no to their competition. All I need to do is update my terms of service accordingly, and I can launch! So here we are, I offer this to any small-medium sized business, that does not have the capability or the patience to develop their own GPT-Slack bot. My promise to you is to constantly develop the bot and improve its functionality. I will bring open-source functionality to my bot faster than any large organization could.\n\nI'm still fighting the good fight internally to use the tool. I'm making too much sense and I'm getting closer and closer with each conversation. One day, the right person will say yes. And everyone at my company will be better for it.\n\nThere is a hassle-free one-click install where you can test it for free with your team.

        "title": "Finding the Goldilocks Density: How CoD Prompting Gets Summaries Just Right",
        "body": "Recently came across a team of researchers who published a paper this month about a new prompting technique they are calling Chain of Density (CoD). So I wrote this article on The Prompt Index.\n\nNo need to sign up to any newsletter or even go to my website, here's my full blog piece on it.We all know LLM's can summarise things and we know we can control summary length, topics covered, and style, however, an important but overlooked aspect is information density - (how much detail to include within a constrained length). The ideal goal is a summary that is informative yet clear. Striking this balance can be challenging.A new technique called Chain of Density (CoD) prompting helps address this tradeoff. Recently published research explains the approach and provides insights based on human evaluation.\n\n**Overview of Chain of Density Prompting:** The CoD method works by incrementally increasing the entity density of GPT-4 summaries without changing length. First, GPT-4 generates an initial sparse summary focused on just 1-3 entities. Then over several iterations, it identifies missing salient entities from the source text and fuses them into the summary.To make room, GPT-4 is prompted to abstract, compress content, and merge entities. Each resulting summary contains more entities per token than the last. The researchers generate 5 rounds of densification for 100 CNN/Daily Mail articles.\n\n[Griffin Adams, Alexander Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric Lehman, No\u00e9mie Elhadad \\(2023\\). From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarisation with Chain of Density Prompting](https://preview.redd.it/6s96w1iwsgpb1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=18aff9523e1f3021aeefad2f7cb182403ddd2c3a)\n\n**Key Findings:**Humans preferred CoD summaries with densities close to human-written ones over sparse GPT-4 summaries from vanilla prompts.CoD summaries became more abstract, fused content more, and reduced bias toward early text over iterations.There was a peak density beyond which coherence declined due to awkward fusions of entities.An entity density of \\~0.15 was ideal, vs 0.122 for vanilla GPT-4 and 0.151 for human summaries.Contributions:The researchers introduced the CoD prompting strategy and thoroughly evaluated the impact of densification. They provided key insights into balancing informativeness and clarity. The team also open-sourced annotated data and 5,000 unannotated CoD summaries to enable further research.\n\n**Conclusion:**This study highlights the importance of achieving the right level of density in automated summarisation. Neither overly sparse nor dense summaries are optimal. The CoD technique paired with human evaluation offers a promising path toward readable yet informative AI-generated summaries.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* Ask for multiple summaries of increasing detail. Start with a short 1-2 sentence summary, then ask for a slightly more detailed version, and keep iterating until you get the right balance of conciseness and completeness for your needs.\n* When asking ChatGPT to summarise something lengthy like an article or report, specify that you want an \"informative yet readable\" summary. This signals the ideal density based on the research.\n* Pay attention to awkward phrasing, strange entity combinations, or unconnected facts when reading AI summaries. These are signs it may be too dense and compressed. Request a less dense version.\n* For complex topics, don't expect chatbots to convey every detail in a highly compressed summary - there are limits before coherence suffers. Ask for a slightly longer summary if needed.\n* Remember that for optimal clarity and usefulness, AI summaries should have a similar density to those written by humans. Extreme brevity may mean missing key details.\n* The core takeaway is that density impacts the quality and usefulness of AI summarisation. As an end user, being aware of this can help you prompt for and identify the \"goldilocks\" level of density for your needs, avoiding summaries that are either frustratingly vague or confusingly overloaded.\n\nHope you enjoyed it, feedback welcome :) and if you did enjoy it and fancy checking out my newsletter, you can sign up [here](https://www.thepromptindex.com/newsletter.html) and grab my free eBook as a thank you!\n\n**Blog Source:** [The Prompt Index](https://www.thepromptindex.com/6504cdb03ef0b.html)\n\nFull credit to Griffin Adams, Alexander Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric Lehman, No\u00e9mie Elhadad (2023).

        "body": "So, it looks like the recent changes in ChatGPT aren't just affecting the main version - the API seems to be impacted too. A bunch of us, myself included, have noticed that the API's response times are way faster now, but the trade-off seems to be a dip in accuracy.\n\nthere are even some folks saying it's performing more like a GPT 3.5 now, which really makes you wonder if they've downgraded the model without telling us. I mean, yeah, the devs don't HAVE to explain themselves, but it's a bit concerning for those of us who rely on the platform when there's no transparency about what's going on \n\nIt would be fair to come openly that they have to downgrade or do whatever they are doing with the models instead being deceptive with the models vs the performance they are delivering, ik they don't owe anyone any answer but even what now is happening isn't good practice,\n\nthis feels more of being cheated at the cost of GPT 4 and getting GPT 3.5 results, the costs haven't dipped anywhere, and I won't be surprised if they somehow publicly come and say they have decreased the prices now",

        "body": "**TL;DR**: chat with AI, code with AI, speak to AI (voice-to-text + vice versa), have AI search huge corpora or websites for you, all via an interface of collaborating on a text doc together in the editor you use now.\n\n# Motivation\n\nI find the last year of AI incredibly heartening. Researchers are still regularly releasing SoTA models in disparate domains. Meta is releasing [powerful models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/) under generous provisions (As is the [UAE](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae)?!). And the Open Source community has shown a tidal wave of interest and effort into building things out of these tools ([112k repos](https://github.com/topics/machine-learning) on GH mentioning ML!).\n\nFacing this deluge of valuable things that communities are shepherding into the world, I wanted to incorporate them into my workflows, which as a software engineer, means my text editor.\n\n\n# UniteAI\n\nSo I started [**UniteAI**](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai), an Apache-2.0 licensed tool.\n\nCheck out the [screencasts](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#some-core-features). \n\n\nThis project:\n\n* Ties in to **any editor** via [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol). Like collaborating in G-Docs, you collab with whatever AI directly in the document, all of you *writing alongside each other* concurrently.\n\n* Like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) / [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/), it can write code/text right in your doc.\n\n* It supports **any Locally runnable model** (Llama family, Falcon, Finetunes, the [21k available models on HF](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) etc.)\n\n* It supports **OpenAI/ChatGPT** via API key.\n\n* **Speech-to-Text**, useful for writing prompts to your LLM\n\n* You can do **Semantic Search** ([Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)) on many sources: local files, [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org) pdfs, youtube transcripts, Project Gutenberg books, any online HTML, basically if you give it a URI, it can probably use it.\n\n* You can trigger features easily via [key combos](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#keycombos).\n\n* Written in Python, so, much more generic than writing a bespoke `some_specific_editor` plugin.\n\n* This project was built with a goal for easy collaboration, so it can dynamically load only the modules you're interested in.\n\nEG, in config:\n\n    modules:\n      - uniteai.openai\n      - uniteai.transcription\n      - uniteai.document\n      # - uniteai.local_llm\n      # - uniteai.contrib.text_to_speech\n      # - uniteai.contrib.example\n\n\n# Caveat\n\nSince it always comes up, **AI is not perfect**. AI is a tool to augment your time, not replace it. It hallucinates, it lies, it bullshits, it writes bad code, it gives dangerous advice. \n\nBut can still do many useful things, and for me it is a **huge force multiplier.**\n\n**You need a Human In The Loop**, which is why it's nice to work together iteratively on a text document, per, this project. *You* keep it on track.\n\n\n\n# Why is this interesting\n\nThese tools play well when used together:\n\n* **Code example:** I can Voice-to-Text a function comment then send that to an LLM to write the function.\n\n* **Code example 2:** I can chit chat about project architecture plans, and strategies, and libraries I should consider.\n\n* **Documentation example:** I can retrieve relevant sections of my city's building code with a natural language query, then send that to an LLM to expound upon.\n\n* **Authorship example**: I can have my story arcs and character dossiers in some markdown file, and use that guidance to contextualize an AI as it works with me for writing a story.\n\n* **Entertainment example**: I told my AI it was a Dungeon Master, then over breakfast with friends, used Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Wizened-Wizard-Voice, and played a hillarious game. I still had to drive all this via a text doc, and handy key combos.\n\n* **Bonus:** This brings all the tools into one easy-to-use place. Contrast that with all the tools that need their own setup, own environments, have their own webui/cli interface, etc.\n\n\n# Installation\n\nI've got installation [instructions on the repo](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#quickstart-installing-everything).\n\nIn a nutshell, if you use VSCode for ex, grab [UniteAI from the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/uniteai).\n\nAnd you need python and pip installed, but then it's just `pip install \"uniteai[all]\"`.\n\nI encourage you to read the [instructions](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#quickstart-installing-everything) though.\n\n\n# RFC\n\nCheck out the [discussion on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37363029)!\n\nThis is still nascent, and I welcome all feedback, positive or critical.\n\nWe have a Discord linked on the repo which you're invited to join.\n\nI'd love love to chat with people who like this idea, use it, want to see other features, want to contribute their effort, want to file bug reports, etc. \n\nA big part of my motivation in this is to socialize with like-minds, and build something cool.\n\n**Thanks for checking this out!**",

        "title": "GPT4 on Open-Source vs Not",
        "body": "Prompt: Please provide five compelling arguments in favor of making OpenAI fully open-source and then provide five compelling counter-arguments. Lastly, please carefully evaluate and assign weights to each respective side and draw a conclusion as to which outcome will be the most beneficial for humanity in the long run \n\n\nChatGPT\n\n\nArguments in Favor of OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:\n\nAccelerated Innovation: Open-sourcing AI research allows for collective advancement. Researchers from around the world can contribute, leading to faster, more diverse innovation. A single organization may not be able to match the collective intelligence of a global open-source community. (Weight: 8/10)\nTransparency and Trust: Full transparency can lead to a greater level of trust between the public and the organization. It allows for better understanding and scrutiny of the technology, its biases, and its potential weaknesses. (Weight: 7/10)\nReduced Monopolization: By open-sourcing AI, it could prevent the concentration of AI power within a single or a few entities. This could foster a more equitable distribution of AI benefits and opportunities. (Weight: 8/10)\nEducation and Skill Development: Open-source projects provide an invaluable resource for students and professionals looking to learn and develop their skills. By open-sourcing AI, we could nurture a new generation of AI researchers and practitioners. (Weight: 6/10)\nAddressing Reproducibility Crisis: The scientific community has been grappling with a reproducibility crisis where many studies cannot be independently verified. Open-source AI can help resolve this by allowing others to directly verify and build upon the work. (Weight: 7/10)\nCounter-Arguments Against OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:\n\nPotential Misuse: If OpenAI\u2019s technology is fully open-source, it could be misused for malicious purposes, such as deepfakes, spam, digital fraud, and autonomous weaponry. This is a significant risk. (Weight: 9/10)\nQuality Control: Open-source projects can sometimes suffer from inconsistencies and irregularities due to the diverse range of contributors. It can be challenging to maintain high standards of quality and performance. (Weight: 6/10)\nCommercial Viability: OpenAI also needs to sustain itself. If all the technology was open-source, it could be challenging to maintain a competitive edge and generate revenue. (Weight: 7/10)\nPrivacy and Security Concerns: Open-source projects can inadvertently expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities, leading to privacy and security concerns. (Weight: 8/10)\nRegulation and Oversight: It is more difficult to regulate and oversee an open-source project due to its decentralized nature. This could lead to unanticipated consequences or the development of systems that are misaligned with human values. (Weight: 8/10)\nEvaluation and Conclusion:\n\nThe total weight for the arguments in favor of OpenAI becoming fully open-source is 36/50, while the total weight for the counter-arguments against it is 38/50. This evaluation suggests that while there are significant benefits to open sourcing AI, the potential risks and challenges slightly outweigh these advantages.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean open-sourcing should be completely dismissed. Rather, it underlines the need for a nuanced approach to open sourcing AI. We need to balance transparency and collaborative innovation with safety, ethical considerations, and the need for sustainable business models. This might involve open sourcing some aspects of the technology, while keeping others proprietary or releasing them in a controlled manner. It also highlights the importance of creating robust regulatory frameworks for AI, regardless of whether the technology is open-sourced or not.",

I work with a lot of niche data, and being able to teach it my data, say a scholarly article or a batch of articles on orbital mechanics, would be enormous.

        "body": " This is a recap covering the major news from last week.\n\n* \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n* \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf933 Learning Resources\n\n# \ud83d\udd25Top 3 AI news in the past week\n\n## 1. Expanding Language Horizons\n\nFacebook has [released an open source model called MMS (Massively Multilingual Search)](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scaling-speech-technology-to-1000-languages/) for STT (speech to text), TTS (text to speech) and language identification. \n\nThis is a big breakthrough. Currently, STT and TTS models recognize only 100 languages. With this the technology has been expanded to 1100 languages. That is 10x the current best. \n\nAdditionally, these models can recognize 4000+ languages. \n\nAs per Facebook, they also have half the error rate of OpenAI\u2019s Whisper.\n\nThese guys are on a roll.\n\n## 2. Bing Chat Enters the OS\n\nAfter [Google\u2019s announcement](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin), it was time for Microsoft to announce AI products. Here\u2019s a rundown of what was announced during Microsoft Build:\n\n1. **Windows Copilot**  \\- Microsoft is integrating AI directly into the OS. Now you can do everything you could do with Bing Chat but now on the OS. You can do the usual stuff - summarize emails, documents, re-write etc. But it goes beyond that by integrating into the installed applications.\n\nMicrosoft is also adopting OpenAI's plugin model. So, **you can use ChatGPT and Bing plugins to interact with the integrated AI.** \n\nThe great thing about it is the direct integration into the OS. Eat your heart out, Mac users \u2013 at least for now \ud83d\ude00. Until Apple announces something similar. And someone will come up with an alternative solution. Especially, because of the privacy concerns with Microsoft telemetry. \n\nThe bad thing is - [the security aspect of the plugins](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). It can open a whole new attack vector on the OS and antivirus softwares might struggle with it. \n\nIt also might be the second nail in the coffin for all the summarize, \u201ctalk to your document\u201d apps. Once, this feature is integrated with [Google Docs](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin) and Microsoft Office - why will you want to pay for extra apps?\n\n1. **Search comes to ChatGPT**  \\- Looks like OpenAI had enough of the testing and new features are being rolled out [left](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin) and [right](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). \n\nNo prizes for guessing the search engine behind it. Ding, Ding, Ding..It\u2019s Bing!\n\n1. **Co-Pilot in PowerPages** \\- Microsoft is now adding AI to their [PowerPages platform](https://powerpages.microsoft.com/en-in/), their low-code tool to build websites. It\u2019ll help users to generate text, forms etc.\n2. **Microsoft Fabric** \\- A new data analytics platform built on top of Azure Data lake but can get data from S3, Google cloud etc. It can help users build pipelines, write code, and build ML models.\n\n## 3. From Trusted Advisor to Nightmare: The Hazards of Depending on AI\n\nHere\u2019s a [fun story which is breaking out on Legal twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html). \n\nA man filed a personal injury lawsuit against Avianca airlines. Avianca's lawyers wasted no time and requested the judge to dismiss the case. The man's lawyer had a different plan in mind. He submitted a document citing half a dozen cases that bolstered his client's claims.\n\nHere's the twist\u2014the judge and Avianca's lawyer couldn't locate any of the referenced cases. Quite a conundrum, right? The lawyer was then asked to provide copies of these elusive cases. The lawyer submitted screenshots as evidence, taking extra precautions to ensure their authenticity. \n\nYou already know the direction this story is taking. \n\nThe lawyer had used ChatGPT to compose his brief. But little did he know that ChatGPT had supplied him with fake cases.\n\nWhen asked to file tangible copies of these cases, the lawyer turned to ChatGPT once again. ChatGPT had reassured him that the cases were genuine. Feeling emboldened, the lawyer used ChatGPT to provide the requested copies. He even went as far as incorporating chat screenshots into a legal document.\n\nThe lawyer maintains that it was never his intention to deceive the court. He expressed regret for relying on ChatGPT for their research. Unfortunately, the judge isn't pleased with this turn of events. The judge has threatened sanctions against both the lawyer and his firm.\n\nIt serves as a stark reminder of how ChatGPT has fooled many people. There is a clear warning stating that ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information. But many tend to overlook these warnings. Even legal professionals!!\n\nThis story carries significant importance for those who fear job insecurity. The lawyer and his firm could have prevented the entire debacle. They should've used paralegal services. They instead relied on ChatGPT's. It's a hard lesson learned the hard way.\n\nMy sincere hope is that this story serves as a valuable lesson. It helps people avoid making similar mistakes. The legal community might become apprehensive about ChatGPT's use moving forward.\n\n# \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f10 AI news highlights and interesting reads\n\n1. [OpenAI says in 10 years AI could be as productive as one of today\u2019s large corporations](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. To achieve this, countries need to form something like the [IAEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency). The IAEA is an intergovernmental agency under the UN to oversee nuclear energy. This \u201cAI agency\u201d will monitor the AI systems and conduct inspections. Just like nuclear energy is tracked through signatures, they suggest using compute and energy usage to track systems.\n2. In the meantime, [Google is working on voluntary rules](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/eu-google-ai-pact/) until there are some real regulations in place. \n3. [As per Pew Research, 58% of Americans have heard of ChatGPT. Even less - 14% have tried ChatGPT. ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/)\n4. Sharing prompts and results has been a pain. Taking screenshots is one way. But then everyone has to type in the prompts manually. Or you can share as plain text. But ChatGPT results are non-deterministic. So, the results might not be the same. Even the lawyer above would\u2019ve loved this feature. Now you will be able to [share your ChatGPT conversations publicly](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq).\n5. LLM Agents and plugins need to connect to tools to perform the tasks outside the LLM environment. So, it is important for the LLM to know which API to call and pass correct arguments. [Gorilla is a fine-tuned Llama-model which can generate the correct call and arguments](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/). \n6. If you are trying to build something beyond a document summarizer or a wrapper around GPT4 API, [things can be hard](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/hard-stuff-nobody-talks-about-llm). Finding the correct context window, dealing with slow responses (I am looking at you GPT-4) etc are some of the problems. \n7. [The AI boom could expose investors\u2019 natural stupidity](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ai-boom-could-expose-investors-natural-stupidity-2023-05-19/). \n8.

Doing usage calculations I could say that using the API I could spend $10 with the limitation of 25 messages per hour.

        "body": "So I\u2019ve been playing with both and I\u2019m finding the ChatGPT output to be more useful. \n\nFor example, I asked ChatGPT to \u201cshow me a formula to calculate the RSI technical indictor in Excel\u201d and it actually wrote the proper formula from scratch along with an example with data in cell A1. It also made note of a few other variations used by traders and how to calculate them which I thought was a nice addition. \n\nI asked Davinci-003 with the exact same prompt and it spit out \u201c=RSI(A1:A30)\u201d. Well obviously there is no RSI function in Excel unless you create it from scratch through VBA so it was quite worthless. I had to specify \u201cwrite it from scratch\u201d.\n\nAnother issue is that when I write a story with both, I can type \u201ccontinue\u201d and ChatGPT will continue on if it gets cut off, whereas Davinci will say something to the effect of \u201cQuestion has been answered\u201d or it just types a few more words and stops.\n\n**Are there settings in Davinci to make it give output similar to ChatGPT? Or maybe I\u2019m not giving the right prompts?**\n\nFunny enough I asked ChatGPT and Davinci this very question and ChatGPT gave a much more detailed and proper answer vs Davinci. \n\nDavinci said \u201cchange some hyperparameters\u201d whereas ChatGPT made note that the models were trained differently and under different hyperparameters so it was nearly impossible. \n\n**Thoughts or any insights to help with my ignorance?**",

        "title": "ChatGPT and I create a new game -- Legend Showdown!",
        "body": " \n\nWell, technically I created the game, and ChatGPT named it.  It also added a new rule, being the team-up round.   \n\nMy input is in bold below :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I'm thinking of  a new game, and I wondered if you could help me name it and formulate the rules.**\n\nI'd love to help! What kind of game are you thinking of creating?\n\n**It's a game where there is a fictional battle between two characters.  Each player chooses a literary character like Captain Ahab, Harry Potter, or James Bond.  Or they can choose a more generic genre trope like a zombie or a ninja.  Then the players ask you, ChatGPT, to describe the fight.  Whoever you choose as the winner ends up scoring the point.**\n\nThat sounds like a really interesting and fun game! How about we call it \"Legend Showdown\"? For the rules, each player can choose a character or genre trope, and then take turns asking you, the \"arbiter,\" to describe a battle between their character and their opponent's character. You can use your knowledge and imagination to describe the action, and then declare a winner. The player whose character wins the battle earns a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Does that sound good?\n\n**Yes, that sounds great.  But I specifically want you to be the arbiter.**\n\nAs the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters chosen by the players and describe an exciting and evenly matched battle between them. At the end of each round, I will declare a winner based on my assessment of which character would come out on top in the given scenario. The player whose character wins the battle will earn a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Is there anything else you would like to include in the rules?\n\n**Hmm, what if there is also a big free-for-all fight using all the characters at the same time?**\n\nIn that case, you could have a special round where all of the characters are placed in a battle together. The players can take turns asking you to describe the action, and you can decide how the battle plays out and which characters come out on top. The player whose character emerges victorious in the free-for-all battle can earn an additional point. You could also have a rule where players can choose to team up with other players and their characters, forming alliances to take on the other characters together. This could add an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\n**Yes, the team up is a great idea!  Also, you are the arbiter, not me.   Can we try a practice round?**\n\nSure! I'm happy to play a practice round with you. Just let me know which characters you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.\n\n**Okay, this is exciting.  Here is the practice round:  Describe Katniss Everdeen (from Hunger Games) taking on Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead.**\n\nIn this battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, the skilled hunter and archer from the Hunger Games series, facing off against Daryl Dixon, the rugged survivor from The Walking Dead.\n\nAs the battle begins, Katniss draws her bow and takes aim at Daryl, who readies his crossbow in response. Both characters are skilled in ranged combat, but Katniss has the advantage of her superior archery skills and training in the Hunger Games arena.\n\nDaryl, however, is a formidable opponent, with years of experience surviving in a world overrun by zombies. He is resourceful and quick on his feet, able to improvise weapons and traps from his surroundings.\n\nAs the two characters exchange shots, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Katniss is able to land several shots with her bow, but Daryl is able to dodge and deflect them with his crossbow.\n\nFinally, after a long and grueling battle, it seems that Daryl has the upper hand. He has managed to get close to Katniss and disarm her of her bow, leaving her vulnerable. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, however, Katniss pulls out a hidden knife and lunges at him, catching him off guard.\n\nIn the end, it is Katniss who emerges victorious, thanks to her quick thinking and determination.\n\nSo, in this battle, Katniss Everdeen is the winner.\n\n**Oh good job, Katniss!  Okay here is another round, describe the Balrog from Lord of the Rings vs. Thomas the Tank Engine.**\n\nIn this unusual matchup, we have the Balrog, a fiery demon from Middle-earth's ancient past, facing off against Thomas the Tank Engine, a beloved children's character from the story of The Railway Series.\n\nAs the battle begins, the Balrog unleashes a burst of flame from its body, engulfing Thomas in a wall of heat. Thomas, however, is made of tougher stuff than he appears, and manages to withstand the attack thanks to his sturdy metal construction.\n\nEnraged, the Balrog lashes out with its whip, but Thomas is able to dodge and weave around the demon's attacks, using his agility and speed to his advantage.\n\nDespite the Balrog's formidable powers, Thomas proves to be a formidable opponent. His determination and bravery inspire those around him, and he refuses to give up even when the odds are against him.\n\nIn the end, it is Thomas who emerges victorious, thanks to his unbreakable spirit and his ability to overcome seemingly impossible challenges.\n\nSo, in this battle, Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.\n\n**That's an unexpected win from Thomas.  Okay, now let's try a team up round.  Do you want to choose teams?**\n\nSure! Let's see... for this round, I will put Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine on the same team, and we'll pit them against the Balrog and Daryl Dixon.\n\nAs the battle begins, Katniss and Thomas charge at their opponents, with Katniss firing arrows and Thomas puffing out clouds of steam. The Balrog and Daryl are caught off guard by this unexpected attack, and struggle to defend themselves against the combined might of Katniss and Thomas.\n\nDespite their best efforts, however, the Balrog and Daryl are no match for the teamwork and determination of Katniss and Thomas. Together, the two characters are able to outmaneuver and outlast their opponents, eventually emerging victorious.\n\nSo, in this battle, the team of Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.\n\n**Okay thanks.  Now do the free-for-all round!**\n\nIn this free-for-all battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, Thomas the Tank Engine, the Balrog, and Daryl Dixon all pitted against each other in an all-out fight.\n\nAs the battle begins, chaos ensues as all four characters attack each other simultaneously. Katniss and Thomas team up, with Katniss firing arrows at the Balrog and Daryl while Thomas uses his steam power to knock them off balance.\n\nThe Balrog and Daryl fight back with ferocity, but they are no match for the combined strength of Katniss and Thomas. Despite their best efforts, they are eventually overpowered and defeated.\n\nIn the end, it is Katniss and Thomas who emerge victorious, thanks to their teamwork and determination.\n\nSo, in this free-for-all battle, the winners are Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nOkay, so the final round was a bit of a disappointment, but I was pretty impressed with the rest of it.",

        "body": "The superficial answer is there is no \"Perplexity O1\" - with that setting, Perplexity is simply providing a front end to the ChatGPT O1 interface through the OpenAI API. You're talking to the same model, so it should perform identically.\n\nThe deeper answer is whether OpenAI configures O1 to behave differently if communicating directly with an OpenAI Pro subscriber through the OpenAI chat interface vs. through the API, either in general or specifically with Perplexity users. There's no indication that any such thing is occurring, either by observation or speculation.\n\nOf course, many have observed or speculated that OpenAI model performance fluctuates over time, even when used through the same interface with the same prompts - e.g., model \"laziness.\"\n\nFirst, the legitimacy of those comments is difficult to test, since, of course, the exact conditions are non-reproducible by end users. Second, even if so, there may be many reasons for such fluctuation: variations in compute per query; variations in compute for different customers, applications, interfaces, and/or regions; and variations over time due to continued model training and/or tweaking of safeguards such as system prompts. OpenAI has been extremely tight-lipped about whether model performance varies *at all,* let alone the reasons for such variation. So, for end users, all of this is impossible to explore or discuss.\n\nMy recommendation is to treat the Perplexity interface to O1 as the same or similarly to direct access via OpenAI.",

This goes for basically every model by the way, they all have output limits while GPT-4 is simply constrained by its context window. So even if your query is 2k tokens it will still give you 6k (at least 2k more). \n\nI have a conditional on my backend that if the modelID is 'gpt-4', then it sets the `max_tokens` parameter to 6000. I\u2019d need to check on Llama3 and if they\u2019ve followed the same trend of limiting response lengths. I\u2019ve yet to integrate into [my usual API portal](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal), but when I do test it out I\u2019ll see if it fills out text better than GPT-4; my use case for that specific model is usually menial copy-paste work that I don\u2019t want to separate into multiple I/Os. \n\nIn terms of performance though, yeah, I have Turbo as my default and most commonly used, with the occasional query to Opus, etc.. Would have to see how Llama3 compares since I\u2019d be paying by the GPU cycle iirc if it\u2019s not through qroq and if it\u2019s mid then I\u2019d rather just Mixtral. Edit: ik different models have different niches and specialties, and the ones I have so far have been sufficient for my needs, so I\u2019m not in a rush to dedicate testing time or anything to llama until 400b releases.",

The tweet is way too old to find now but I think I remember them saying in November that they were transitioning all ChatGPT models to the Turbo models, as they\u2019re cheaper to run at inference time. \n\nTLDR yes this is about the API, see [my top comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/vdnCASZSvj), but you\u2019re probably using a slightly fine-tuned version of the models we\u2019re talking about with a backend using [the Assistants API Beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), designed specifically for people who want an easy interface, and probably had been RLHP\u2019d to not pay as much attention to the User\u2019s requests when weighing their tokens, and rather prefer the system, which is why I prefer the API for things I want finer control over.\n\nYou don't need to worry about API costs or relative intelligence if you only care to use the ChatGPT interface though. If you want to get into it, you can definitely read their Documentation at [docs.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [their Help Article Explanation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api) ([and also here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8234522-chat-completions-api-system-message-vs-custom-instructions-in-ui))of what the differences between the two are. \n\nLastly, it's a bit old at this point but I wrote a [ReadMe Document on GitHub](https://github.com/zaki-1052/gptportal) some time ago with fairly universal info about the API if that's useful to you.",

        "body": "The leaderboard has a lot of flaws. Perhaps the biggest one is that the old versions of GPT-4 are no longer being tested, so there is no direct comparison between those older versions and GPT-4 Turbo. \n\nAnother thing to consider is benchmarks on standardized tests. The original GPT-4 performs as well as GPT-4 Turbo on tests like the MMLU and the SAT. Meanwhile, the models that have a similar ELO score to the original GPT-4 on lmsys all score way lower on these benchmarks than GPT-4. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that newer models are more optimized to provide satisfying, readable answers, but they aren't necessarily smarter. GPT-4 comes from a time before this benchmark and before direct comparison by users was possible, because it was in a class of its own. GPT-4 Turbo is clearly better at getting to the point in a way that users prefer, but that doesn't mean it's smarter.",

        "body": "Yeah, the Assistants API is what Custom GPTs are using on the backend of chat. You can read more about it [in their documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). It basically lets you reuse an \u201cAssistant\u201d, or a GPT with a specific System Message across multiple sessions, while attaching files and other integrations as \u201cknowledge\u201d using RAG (retrieval augmented generation), and their native \u201cCode Interpreter\u201d.\n\nFor the latter, that isn\u2019t really the point of the CI tool; it\u2019s just their PR name for the ability to natively run Python code in an invisible Jupyter Notebook so that it can make graphs and perform complex calculations (think cosine similarity between vectors or long integrals). \n\nBecause Python is uniquely suited for mathematics, and LLMs are especially bad at it, they made this CI tool to compensate. It\u2019s basically the only reason why I\u2019m keeping my Plus sub, since they make you pay per session of activity, and it\u2019s extremely useful whenever I need Calculus tutoring and the like\u2014guaranteed no mistakes. \n\nThe ability can be replicated through the API portal I made though, since again I do sometimes like finer control over the model\u2019s behavior, which the Assistants API offers in addition to better attention paid to the any attached files and the like; pretty sure Chat is too crowded by the [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. \n\nEdit: sorry, totally misunderstood your last sentence lol. For other languages: \n\nYou don\u2019t really need an additional tool for that, as you can just edit the instructions (either with a text editor or in the front end functionality I wrote), and then start a conversation with simple Chat Completions or Assistants Mode. It\u2019ll adhere extremely closely to whatever instruction you gave, like, \u201cYou\u2019re an expert JavaScript programmer\u2026.\u201d Or whatever.\n\nFeel free to test out different prompts and delete/modify what\u2019s there in the box by default; it\u2019ll be pretty similar to the regular CustomGPTs you\u2019re using through Chat, generally speaking. An interpreter for other languages wouldn\u2019t do anything (unless it were Java or something I guess, but I\u2019d just say to write Java code and then convert it to its equivalent in Python to test). \n\nLike, it can\u2019t run anything in a terminal (well technically [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) can, but that\u2019s a different project), but it wouldn\u2019t host a Node.js environment in prod or anything, you\u2019d just use its resulting code from the \u201cAssistant\u201d for a larger project. You can try something like: \n\n>\u201dYou\u2019re an expert Programmer specializing in both Python and Java development. Your task is to help me write and test whatever Java program with these specifications. However, once you write the Java code, I\u2019d like you to convert it step-by-step into Python code, and pass it into your Python \u201cCode Interpreter tool\u201d. Test and run the equivalent code, in order to verify the output of the Java program through Python.\u201d",

What is your hair color and hairstyle?\n2. What color are your eyes?\n3. What kind of clothes do you usually wear?\n4. Do you wear glasses or have any distinctive features like a beard or tattoos?\n5. How would you describe your typical facial expression or any pose you'd like to be drawn in?\n\nMe: I had brown hair but I am bald on top so I try to keep my head shaved, but my beard is brown. My eyes are greenish blue. I usually wear plain t-shirts with no logos, and jeans. I don't wear glasses. I'm 46, male and white. I am heavier and have a bald head. My ears are pinned to the sides of my head. I normally wear red shirts. I don't really have earlobes. \n\n----\n\nSecond chat:\n\n(Upload a picture of me) \n\nMe: this is me, how would you describe me. \n\nBot: You appear to be a confident individual with a close-cropped haircut and a well-maintained, full beard. You're wearing a collared, dark-colored shirt that suggests a smart casual style. Your expression is neutral, and there's an attentiveness in your gaze. The setting seems to be an indoor public space, possibly an airport or a mall, suggested by the signage in the background.\n\nMe: Yeah, it is an airport. Use that description of me to see how well you can produce an image of me.",

As in, whenever I used one of the systems and it would somehow produce a bad answer for some question, it was actually overall more convenient or simpler to just ask the same question to the other system, versus trying to argue with the first system or doing anything but the most basic rephrasing of the original question.\n\nSo, overall, I would recommend to not stick to any one particular system, because it doesn't appear to be feasible to have a good overview of the detailed strengths and weaknesses of each system.",

When I think about all the time I've saved and the mental stress it's taken off my plate, it's honestly great. Complex texts that used to take me hours of polishing and refining now come together in a single output, often requiring no further edits at all. The actual input / output process takes far less time than the prompting / subsequent editing and combining of outputs. Everything now flows naturally and effortlessly, without feeling like I need to strain my brain to its limits throughout the day.\n\nThe time savings and mental relief it provides are truly remarkable. Initially, I only purchased it due to FOMO (fear of missing out), but I never expected it would become such a valuable tool in my daily routine.",

You probably don't know much about trading / quant finance, but pro output is very on-point, that's my point about on par with big-4 consultants, if you paid some big name agency, they probably give you the same answers, with more fancy diagrams / powerpoints of course LOL.  To be clear though, this ain't Jane Street, etc. real hedge fund level lol, but it's quite sophisticated. \n\n3.

Custom instructions help a lot but you only get one set of those.  I didn't start REALLY using AI code generation till I started using LibreChat and system prompts.\n\nI look at copilot as something like a single-purpose kitchen tool.  It does one thing really well and that's it.  With copilot that thing is IDE integration.  If I was in any way unhappy with the results I get out of GPT I might explore it but I've been quite happy with the output and LOVE the flexibility I have via the GPT API.\n\nFWIW most of the talk about regression in GPT coding ability comes from people that don't actually know how to write code and thus can't clearly articulate their needs.",

So, when we talk about **labial** sounds, we mean the sounds you make by using your lips. For example, when you say the letters **\"P\"**, **\"B\"**, and **\"M\"**, your lips press together and then pop open to make the sound. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called **bilabial sounds**\u2014because you use both lips.\n\nNow, the letter **\"F\"** is different. When you say **\"F\"**, you don\u2019t press your lips together. Instead, you bite your bottom lip with your top teeth to make the sound. So, even though you use your lip, it\u2019s not the same as the other sounds where your lips touch each other. That\u2019s why **\"F\"** is called a **labiodental sound** instead.",

        "body": "The \"bite your lip\" thing is wrong and kind of hilarious, but you do _touch_ your bottom lip to your upper teeth. Also, the \"pop open\" part refers to the \"burst\" of the /p/ or /b/ stop consonants, which is optional. The burst does contain very salient information of the identity of the sounds but it's not necessary. Nasal consonants like /m/ have no burst at all, the sound is made during the closure (which is why you can say \"mmmmm\"). Otherwise the explanation is correct. \n\nIf this were a question on a phonetics quiz I'd give it half credit. It did get the main point correct (bilabial vs. labiodental), but it introduced two troubling misconceptions that belie a lack of understanding of basic articulatory phonetics.",

        "body": "For o1, did OpenAI really train it on CoT examples, or did they just hardcode CoT prompting into the code behind the scenes? I had heard it wasn\u2019t actually a new model, though this could mean they fine tuned the existing pretrained model.\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s Perplexity\u2019s answer to my question:\n\n> OpenAI's o1 model was trained using reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) processes. This approach allows the model to refine its reasoning strategies and improve performance on complex tasks. While CoT prompting is a technique used in o1, it is not merely hardcoded; instead, it is part of the model's training to think and reason more effectively. Thus, o1 represents a new model trained with specific methods, rather than just an existing model with added CoT prompts.",

And chatGPT was able to take the question and turn it into the correct sql queries and than came back with a view of the data. \n\nI want to do something similar for a game of mine where I have a lot of static data that I have in a database. Access those informations and do on top use the right formulas.\n\nOne example would be that I ask it to calculate the most optimal team for a DPS character. So it would need to know the formulas to be used, the standards and assumptions for certain parts of the build and so on. As of now such calcs would be done in a spreadsheet. And since there is a lot of different use cases it is really hard to just build one streamlined application that covers all of these. It is also not meant for a wide audience but as a power user tool.\n\nCan you recommend me an articles or videos that go about that. At least I would want to start with generating views within my app like \"which character has the highest base hp?\" something like that.",

Tell it you need help setting up your development environment, etc.  first thing you need to do is to provide it the high level overview of what you are trying to achieve.  Then ask it to break down the project and also analyze the languages, tools, libraries, etc. it thinks will best achieve the goal.  Once it gives you a full blown project breakdown, then start asking it how to set up your environment and go from there.\n\nFor reference, I am trying to learn flutter.  I'm not new to programming but I'm new to flutter and dart.  I explained all of this and it helped me set up the flutter SDK and everything and then it generated the full boiler plate code for the UI all in one LONG response.  I literally copied and pasted into separate files and then ran it.  I provided feedback for modifications and it made the changes.  You can ask it to supply both just the changes as well as the full files so you can review the changes quickly and then take the full updated file and just copy paste to replace the existing file.\n\nIn 2 hours I had a fully working UI.  The backend stuff isn't hooked up yet, but I didn't ask it that yet.  I was focused on getting a functional UI.",

        "body": "This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   \n  \n(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, \"that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change.\" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. \n\nSo I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. \n\nAnother thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. \"Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?\" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info. \n\nClaude 3.5 is the opposite. Explains well but keeps it compact, neat and easy to read.",

Claude really struggled with grabbing correct configs and had broken syntax all over the place. Wasn't able to add a functional \"before all\" hook either.\n\nMini got it done in one prompt and fixed all of Claude's errors while explaining why they were wrong.

Having it do the repetitive tasks for me.  \n  \n e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. \"I have pain in my \\*foot\\*\". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc\". The prompt field may be called pain\\_location\\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\\_conditions\\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' \n\n01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.\n\n01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. \"medication\\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc.\" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, \"I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\\_location\\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste\" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, \"I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up\" and it will then do what I asked.

I ran out of data before and it was a similar short time before I could start again. I don't know if after starting again you're completely reset or you have reduced data since you already hit a limit a few hours before. I've never been right back at it to test the limits.\n\nI've noticed (and it does remind you) that if you continue on in the same prompt with a lot of text it will use your data faster as it 'considers' all of the text in that entire prompt before answering. I still mostly have stayed in the same convo per session as it seems to remember basically everything. I suspect, but am not sure, that this remembering all of the conversation is what makes it better than GPT at the repetitive tasks.",

This is what people are referring to when they say it \"does too much\". Any issues that pop up will be harder to debug especially since you have no experience. With Claude, you can take it step by step and test as you go so that you aren't stuck with an end product that you aren't even aware of what it does.\n\nI'm sure you can prompt o1-mini to suggest incremental changes, but that sort of defeats the purpose of the model. Considering it's cost, you really want to use it for what it was made for, but it is likely overkill for whatever you are trying to do.",

        "body": "I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It\u2019s interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication\u2014phrasing, timing,or reviewing responses\u2014and how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one\u2019s decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication\u2014it\u2019s about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. \n\n\nTL;DR: \n\nI guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it\u2019s not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting \u201cone\u2019s best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things\u201d, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",

        "body": "So much goalpost shifting in this thread.  This is a huge deal.  Computers have always had more 'knowledge' than humans, but they've never before been better at reasoning.  This means low level white collar work can effectively become automated.  That's a lot of jobs.  As an example, the role of SDR (Sales Development Representative), which was traditionally the entry level Sales role is now obsolete.  It doesn't mean everyone will be getting fired in the next year, but in 10 years, no major company will be hiring for this role as it exists today. The nature of this role will inevitably change.  Just as 'typists' as a professional career became obsolete, but many people who would have been in that role became 'executive assistants'.\n\nIf you're reading this, you should be spending your time thinking about what the future of work looks like, and how you can prepare.",

The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the \"benchmark\" tests for humans too.\n\nIt's possible the tests are invalid by some logic, but you've not given that logic, just stated \"hey this test is for humans and AI is not human\". You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.\n\nSee the thing is, a for loop can count faster than humans. My car is faster than any human; a race literally measures a real thing called speed.

While it didn't had exact translated data of them ( exactly same like that from author of article ) we don't fully know what type of data it had about them\n\nThis is not a controled environment , this test wouldn't be  legit if it was taken by a human let alone a LLM for which we can assume that it probably had those tests somehow described in it's training data , even though IQ tests don't make a lot of sense when taken by a LLM .

I'm saying that comparing human intelligence to an LLMs's ability to search by narrative and form text is not IQ. The title of this post comparing LLM pattern recognition to IQ is not accurate. This is not IQ. The LLM cannot reason beyond the pattern recognition of the narrative. The words have no real world meaning to it. You can match image pattern recognition to the narrative and make it multimodal but even then it's not a real world entity that can outthink a human.\n\n> The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the \"benchmark\" tests for humans too\n\nIt makes complete sense to say it can do pattern recognition as well or better than a human operator can execute a Google search, but beyond that the comparison falls apart.\n\n> You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.\n\nBecause it's not human. It's not running its algorithm against real world data. It's demonstrating the ability of human narrative to model reality after a million years of evolution. It's not a real world entity using a human body and mind to model reality into narrative. It's simply a machine that is getting better at pattern recognition that results in an outcome a human can connect to the input, that makes sense to a problem set.\n\n> And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.\n\nNo it doesn't. IQ is a unique aspect of living things. A for loop is not counting with human nerves and vocal cords. A car is not expanding and contracting muscle to run. An LLM is not performing real world reasoning. Without the human consciousness perceiving the output it would have no human connection to the human world.\n\nEven if it were given a synthetic body that simulated humanity presence in the world, it would only be simulation, a machine that personified human presence.\n\nIt's time to clean out your basement and throw away that old lamp.",

        "body": "You might be confusing the fact that Verbal Comp having a high loading onto FSIQ, with whether Gc actually contributes more to FSIQ. You can\u2019t think about how much the test performance loads onto FSIQ as how much \u201cweight\u201d that its domain carries. In statistical terms, you\u2019re confusing loadings with weights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYour performance in Verbal Comp is highly representative of Gc. And Gc has the highest \u201cindividuality\u201d compared to the other three domains (it has the lowest intercorrelations)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo the composite score of Verbal Comp has more of an individual contribution in your overall FSIQ calculation, but not because Gc is \u201cweighted\u201d more heavily into your overall FSIQ; it\u2019s because Gc is more uniquely measured by its subdomain, and so the test reflecting it gets a higher individual loading If you are familiar with factor analysis that will be intuitive.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut conceptually, FSIQ is inherently meant to be a measure of one\u2019s shared capacity across the domains; not the simple combined performance on each individual domain. Thus, the calculations of scaled to composite to full scale scores specifically reflect transforming individual test scores into shared capacity across domains\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is why we will put \u201cFSIQ not interpretable\u201d when there is a high discrepancy between verbal and perceptual scores. At that point, the number calculated as the full scale score no longer represents what it is supposed to.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSide note: In statistical terms, if you do a hierarchical regression taking your FSIQ and moving backwards, you should expect the FSIQ to basically completely explain your composite domain scores in your populations. There should be little variance left afterwards. If there is, your assumptions of the validity of your loadings onto FSIQ are not met for that population. This is most obviously seen in people with specific, and not general, learning disabilities",

Of course I'm not because it isn't. But even when given a Western (or similar) education from childhood, the results match. \n\nI'm in no way saying that East Asians are more morally superior or anything like that, just that there is a distinct difference based along ethnic lines. While this difference doesn't mean much on an individual level, when taken as an average (which is what this original post was about) it has a dramatic effect. \n\nI'm also not looking at any data from more than like 30-40 years ago as I was concerned about the validity of potentially racially motivated testing. \n\nNor am I failing to consider things like iodine deficiencies in certain parts of the world (one reason I haven't been discussing African results.)\n\nThe real question for you, is why do you insist that intelligence is the only hereditary trait that hasn't seen massive divergence over millennia? \n\nOr are you merely arguing against the use of IQ tests specifically? \n\nIn which case, I'd again point you to all the other testing that has been done which correlates rather well to the IQ results in their specific categories. \n\nIt also feels perfectly obvious that different cultural norms and environmental pressures would have an effect over hundreds of generations.\n\nIt feels like you're trying to argue that every ethnic group has the same brain and that it is purely social dynamics that make the difference?",

        "body": "Have you ever studied human history? For most of human history there was absolutely no meritocracy and no education for the masses. Mass education is a concept that was born in Northern Europe four/three centuries ago. Before this, there was barely any evolutionary advantage to being extremely intelligent, since there was no way an intelligent commoner would be given an education, with rare exceptions. No advantage for being intelligent = no evolutionary advantage being given to more intelligent people. This is not true for genetic conditions. Many genetic conditions give humans evolutionary advantages, like G6PDH deficiency (resistance against malaria). Humans have migrated very recently from Africa and currently there is not a lot of diversity in our specie. Intelligence has become truly important only thanks to capitalism, meritocracy and mass education, and not everywhere in the planet either. It's pointless being Einstein if you are born in the Central African Republic. Like it or nor, this is something you see in IQ tests if you don't cherry pick things. IQ tests are absolutely comparable among different ethnic groups if you factor in the difference in economic status/country development.",

So that's interesting, and people want to explore the limits of that. In other words, does it matter if it really reasons or \"plays reasoning\" by putting the words in the right order?\n\nLooking at some agent implementations with tricks like \"something of thought\", it's pretty clear that something useful can be extracted from this \"play pretend\". So the more varied \"tests\" where all LLMs are tested the same, the better IMO. They may not be the perfect tests, but they're interesting to have something else to compare.

        "body": "That's not entirely true, since you don't need an education to display intelligence. In fact, that's an insultingly academic way to look at it. \n\nYou are the intelligence you are, regardless of what you learn. You can gain knowledge through education, but it doesn't make you any more intelligent.\n\nI will note that you accept that there was an advantage to intelligence even if only barely. This seems to indicate an agreement on your part since 'barely' is more than able to swing the bell curve a little to the side. Over thousands of years, a little nudge is all that is required, and the data points to the difference being only very few points and barely noticeable on an individual level.\n\nEvolutionary pressure selected for different types of people depending on social and environmental concerns.\n\nFor example, Africa had plentiful wild game available year round, while the far East required far more forward planning in terms of agriculture, food storage, dealing with harsher seasons, etc.\n\nWhat can we derive from this? The most desirable men in Africa were the hunters, those with heightened athletic abilities. This is also backed up by historical records from the region.\n\nWhile in the far East, those who were able to manage land and plan for the future were most likely to be perceived as successful.\n\nWhy? Because in both situations, this 'optimal male' gave their children the greatest chance of survival. I'm using males here because it's mostly been a smaller percentage of men passing on their genes than women, and women have always sought out the best men they can for their future children.\n\nNow fast forward even a dozen generations and see where those genes ended up.\n\nIn both cases, the descendents of the most successful multiplied at a far greater rate than the rest because they were able to have more children, while those children were also more likely to survive.\n\nEach generation also self selects for the same reasons as the previous since nothing has changed for their respective societies.\n\nSo, Africans developed to be more physical and endurance-based, while East Asian genetics leaned more heavily towards a forward planning, intelligence-based group.\n\nBut yea, I'm not following that final point you made, although I think you have underestimated the value of intelligence throughout the years. \n\nHigh intelligence has become more prestigious as a result of a more industrialised and advanced world, but I'm not talking about super duper smarty pants. A difference of just one standard deviation can be the difference between average and mentally struggling with basic tasks.\n\nEven if you self-select merely for 'not low intelligence' you will slowly (over generations) raise the average. The same is true in the reverse, in that in those places where other attributes are more important for survival, then the average intelligence will not rise except coincidentally. \n\nI hope I have made my points clear, and I genuinely enjoy discussing these things in a polite and considered manner.",

It was intended to point out that coming in above the middle of a test intended to rank humans on reasoning is not the evidence of reasoning at the level of a human ... that is all. IQ tests are not proof of ability to reason ... at least not by design. They are developed at great expense to as efficiently as possible rank humans on their ability to reason  ... no more no less.  It is more of an efficient sorting mechanism than anything else. So relative (ranking of reasoning ability) vs absolute (proof of reasoning ability).\n\nThat is all I am saying. So it focuses on low hanging fruit that gets that job done.\n\nHere is a little discussed potential benefit of LLM: Testing and assessment. A dynamic IQ test administered by an LLM could be far more telling (and valid) than a static IQ test.\n\nSimilarly, in the education field, assessment is an enormous inefficiency in the system. Teachers worldwide groan at the \"is this for marks?\" or \"will this be on the test?\" questions. Students frequently select the easiest, not the best teachers. Similarly, education officials struggle with assessment at their level. Standardized tests are flawed and promote rote learning. Attempts at teaching and assessing \"thinking\" skills are a mess, and frustrate everyone from students to parents to teachers. The delineation between formative and summative assessment is poorly grasped ... by educators and students alike. LLM's can change that for the better, I have no doubt. And it is very relevant, as costs of education is outpacing inflation, and western countries are starting to decline in population, so will have to rely on immigration, which brings its own problems for filling skilled jobs.",

When it comes to explaining a topic or concept, it's much more helpful than \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*.\n\nI use it to explain difficult concepts (sometimes in math) and occasionally for coding. It's doing a pretty good job\u2014way better than \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*. I'm not a developer, so I'm not sure which one is better when it comes to coding.\n\nI believe that for general purposes, you should choose \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\*. However, you might not always get to choose which model you use. I've noticed something quite weird: sometimes ChatGPT uses \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\*, and other times it uses \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\*. (I don't know whether this is global or regional.) Based on my testing, ChatGPT is currently using \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* in my area, which is quite disappointing\u2014it basically makes it useless for me.\n\nIf you really want to know the differences between these two models, I suggest you go to \\[platform.openai.com\\](https://platform.openai.com/) to test them. (compare mode) (Increase the maximum output tokens to the max.) Use the following system prompt:\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nYour purpose is to provide information in a way that is detailed and in-depth. You should explain things in a more detailed manner. Maximize detail and length at the same time. You're ChatGPT, a super helpful assistant.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThen ask a question like (replace the topic with anything you like):\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nI'm into neuroscience, particularly neurotransmitters.  \nI would like you to dive into it.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nYou might notice that the output from \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\* is far more detailed and nuanced. In terms of length, \\*\\*\"chatgpt-4o-latest\"\\*\\* often gives responses that are twice as long compared to the standard \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* (it seems the recent version of \\*\\*\"gpt-4o\"\\*\\* is even more concise than the older version).\n\nPlease give it a shot. I believe you will find it mind-blowing or something. (By the way, I'm not a native speaker.)\n\nPlease let me know your test results and your views on this. (btw I use o1 to revise my comment to correct grammar etc)",

I can also attest to using those two models separately through API.\n\nAs the other commenter said, the gpt-4o model is the more stable version that's only updated from time to time. It's currently the same as gpt-4o-2024-08-06 in essence. If there's a major update again in the future, the gpt-4o model will reflect that as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the chatgpt-4o-latest model is the one that's updated more frequently and is more dynamic due to the team's constant tweaking and training. It might reflect changes daily, and it's not necessarily dependent on milestone updates. According to the documentation, chatgpt-4o-latest is the one used by ChatGPT itself.",

I have also purchased GPT4o before for few months, just wanted to figure out what would be a better choice since other AI models have also improved and wanted to go with the best option available thus this post.\n\nAlso it is true that we are an early stage startup with me mostly working on it , but we had made some revenue and not a complete newbie here.\n\nI don't understand how asking for suggestion / other peoples experience reflects my ability to build a startup",

The only reason to use Claude first is for the artifacts for streamlining. Download then upload to LMS. Otherwise, ChatGPT is more student-friendly in tone.\n\nBefore I started using LLMs to come up with new assignments based on very specific inputs that fit my curriculum and assessment practices, I copied and pasted all my assignments pre-AI paradigm into ChatGPT to have it revise them into language and syntax students are more familiar with since they use LLMs all day every day. Now they\u2019re short, step-by-step instructions with bulleted lists so students can comprehend them more easily. Before, as an English professor, I was long-winded and lost students with specific criteria couched in paragraphs. ChatGPT and Claude were game changers.\n\nI do not use LLMs for grading, lesson generation, etc. My curriculum and my students\u2019 learning outcomes are *mine.* I don\u2019t use TAs because my job is *my* job, and I\u2019m picky AF.

        "body": "it was a tougher choice when chatgpt didn't have the equivalent of artifacts in their platform but now they have canvas, which now technically has more features than artifacts although i haven't compared them side by side yet. claude 3.5 sonnet is better at coding than chatgpt 4o but you get rate limited much faster than you do with chatgpt. you also have the reasoning models o1 / o1-mini with chatgpt plus and there arent any for claude pro, i've found that using o1 and 4o together is substantially better than claude simply because it's reasoning is far better and the code is pretty accurate in both. tbh i do most of my work in chatgpt and then for some minor things i switch over to claude, but the claude free version works fine for this. you can also talk through certain coding problems and tasks with chatgpt advanced mode and you can use web search, i dont think either of these are in claude yet. \n\none thing that claude does really well is projects, where you can add different files for context for your conversations with it, but chatgpt has GPTs where you can do the same thing, claude organizes this better though. \n\nhope this helps!",

        "body": "So interesting. Chat GPT's results (black and white drawing / line art) have been far superior and much more realistically detailed vs Bing. Bing's results for me have been very unrefined looking and have weird objects and characteristics in the image that look unrealistic or undistinguishable. Weird objects and hands where you can't really figure out what they are (similar to what Midjourney does in this aesthetic). Whereas for once I'm getting fantastic results in Chat GPT and everything makes sense visually, nothing looks wonky or blurry or weird. And the details are incredible.",

Given that they told SJ they wanted it, and they also tweeted \u201cher\u201d with the release there are already public breadcrumbs to that effect.\n\nWhile I appreciate that the paper trail shows they contacted the other voice actress first, it *sure seems* like they were aware of this precedent and are trying to cover their asses, not that this is all some big coincidence.\n\nThe major finding in the case was related to the average listener\u2019s confusion with the original, NOT a sufficient lack of clean-room separation in the direction.\n\nEDIT: checking the wording of the final decision, it is about consent; timeline is irrelevant: https://web.archive.org/web/20130112210156/https://www2.bc.edu/~yen/Torts/Midler.pdf",

So, the foundation of the model is based on enormous amounts of speech data from different people, while Sky is just fine-tuning with a smaller number of samples.\n\nGiven that OpenAI uses almost everything accessible over the internet to train its models on (except for a few prominent sites), it's safe to assume that the foundational model learned how to reproduce the speech of diverse famous people - there's just no way to instruct it to do so (as for now), so they are fine-tuning instead.",

If she's going to sue anyone she would sue the people who hired her to do that job, fully under the pretense that she sounded like someone else they'd already asked to fulfil that role, and then asked AGAIN after that person's representation said \"No\" before the final release of this stage of the product. \n\nThere are 100% laws for this kind of thing and I look forward to seeing what happens if this goes to court because I couldn't even get a t-shirt printed with my favorite artists face on it, I don't see why a multi-billion dollar enterprise should be exempt from the same kind of thing and I find it very concerning that when someone said \"no\" instead of moving on to something else, they forged a manipulative path towards forcing what they wanted.

They also reached out a second time a few days before launch, but never received a response (after previously being told no). \n\nAlso, Altman mentioned ScarJo\u2019s film Her.\n\nIf a celeb refuses OpenAI the use of their voice, OpenAI legally can\u2019t then hire *or* use a sound-a-like without the celebs permission.\n\nI presume that if OpenAI hadn\u2019t reached out to ScarJo or mentioned \u201cHer\u201d or any other references, they would be fine to use Sky - up until ScarJo calls it out & threatens legal action, after which is would likely have to go to court to decide if the voice was too similar.\n\nAs a comparison, even though it would likely be protected as a \u201cparody\u201d, SouthPark\u2019s creators never use or reach out to any celebs to do their own voices when parodied for this exact reason - in case they explicitly say no. \n\nNote: I\u2019m not a legal expert.",

When the Sky voice was released there was absolutely nothing about the release that strongly implied that people should think that it was ScarJo. I'd argue that most people didn't even think of ScarJo when they heard it because it really doesn't sound that much like her. Like others have said, the \"Her\" tweet came much later and was in reference to the fact that they have delivered on a product, an intelligent AI assistant that speaks in a natural way, that had only been seen in Sci Fi movies up until that point.\n\n  \nIn the case of Bette Midler, they asked her to sing one of her popular songs for their ad and she declined, they then went and found someone to impersonate her and sing her song. So, anyone who saw the ad at the time would very likely think that it was Bette Midler singing one of her popular songs when in fact it wasn't. It was a pretty clear case that Ford was trying to use Bette's likeness without her permission by having someone impersonate her singing one of her own songs.",

The focus is the technology, not the voice actor.\n\nThere is no way Tom Cruise would have a case. Moreover, if Tom Cruise raises this issue in an open letter *and then doesn't even bother to sue*, he's ruined another actor's career for no reason. Terrible, terrible.\n\nSomeone would need to go after him in the interests of justice.",

I am not really getting the Scarlett defenders. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being inspired by Scarlett's voice acting. I do not hear an identical similarity at all, and I doubt a judge would too. \n\nI personally hear an inspiration from  multiple sources that the hired voice actress probably leaned into. \n\nVoice actors and actresses listen to other voices all the time and try to modify/improve upon it for the context they are given. This goes for pretty much ALL of human-made art and music. \n\nLegalities come into play when something has not undergone enough transformation for commercial profit. \n\nI.e, OpenAI cannot have a voice that is too similar to Mickey Mouse. But they can hire a voice actor to do a new cartoony voice with MM as inspiration. Usually, the inspirations are from multiple sources. \n\nCan a Scarlett-defender explain better please?",

They almost pick new fights daily to make it more expensive. Both suing people, and defending against suits, is ruinously expensive for most people. And how much money do you think a voice actor has? And how good of a team of lawyers do you think Scarlett Johansson can afford to hire? Maybe the same people who she hired to successfully beat Disney?

Anyone reasonable could see that.  So can\u2019t see how she could be held liable for loss of earnings here.  This has been precipitated by oai\u2019s choices more than anything.

According to ScarJo's public statement, her attorneys requested that OpenAI provide information about how the Sky voice was created. OpenAI decided to pull the voice.\n\nGiven the very widely discussed similarity between the Sky voice and ScarJo's voice, the fact that Altman had attempted twice (including just days before Sky was unveiled) to get ScarJo to lend her voice to ChatGPT, and his \"her\" tweet, the voice actress reasonably has no legitimate claim against ScarJo. It is obvious that ScarJo, in confronting OpenAI, is seeking to protect her rights, not attempting to illegitimately interfere with the voice actress' agreement with OpenAI.\n\nIf anything, the voice actress OpenAI hired would probably have better odds going after OpenAI, alleging that whatever economic losses she believes she has or will suffer are a result of OpenAI's scheme to violate ScarJo's right to publicity.",

Maybe she was hand picked because of it? Who knows. The point is that enough happened to convince SJ this was them trying to take her voice without authorization (especially since Sam asked SJ to play the voice later on).\n\nIs she right?

That\u2019s not in dispute by either party.\n\nI\u2019ve pasted a link to the Wired article below which summarises it all, but it also contains links to statements from OpenAI and ScarJo which back this up.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/scarlett-johansson-v-openai-could-look-like-in-court/\n\n\u201cOn September 11, 2023, Sam spoke with Ms. Johansson and her team to discuss her potential involvement as a sixth voice actor for ChatGPT, along with the other five voices, including Sky. She politely declined the opportunity one week later through her agent.\u201d - OpenAI\n\n\u201cOn May 10, 2024, Sam contacted Ms. Johansson\u2019s team to inform them about our upcoming launch of GPT-4o and asked if she might reconsider joining as a future additional voice in ChatGPT.\u201d - OpenAI\n\nOnce OpenAI reached out to ScarJo and she declined, the Midler case becomes directly relevant.\n\nOpenAI claims it wasn\u2019t before they cast the Voice actors, but it was over a year ago, well before the Sky voice was launched, and ScarJo declined and refused permission. At that point OpenAI was legally unable to use either her voice or one that sounded like hers.\n\nOn May 13th, ahead of the Sky voice launch, Sam Altman of OpenAI tweeted one word, \u201cher\u201d. It\u2019s still on his timeline.\n\nYou can try and claim it\u2019s just a word and has nothing to do with ScarJo, and that the new OpenAI voice Sky sounding eerily similar to that of the AI from the film \u201cHer\u201d is just a coincidence - but that\u2019s only because you\u2019re not having to defend yourself in court against ScarJo\u2019s lawyers, along with all the contextual evidence & counter claims that OpenAI clearly wanted to use ScarJos voice but were refused.",

The \"Her\" movie could have used any actress' voice, and it would have been just as impactful, because the focus was about a realistic voice assistant. If, on the other hand, you replace Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise movie, it would never become a bit hit. *People go to see Tom Cruise movies to see Tom Cruise*.\n\nNo one watched \"Her\" because of Johannson's voice. It was just cool that she was in it, and which is why they offered Johannson the job. \"Her\" isn't famous because of Johannson. The focus is the technology, not the voice actress.",

        "body": ">So why did OpenAi offer ScarJo the the job? \n\n1 - Because her voice makes for a great engaging AI assistant voice, which is the same reason she was cast for the movie.\n\n2 - Obviously, to drive their point home about how close their AI model is to the technology in the movie. \n\nAnyone with half a brain cell can figure that out they just wanted to do an advertising stunt, but somehow you all seem convinced OpenAI's sole mission is to build towards a ScarJo android.\n\n> And why was it so important for them to have a voice close to HER VOICE? \n\nBecause it's really not that similar at all. She just has a similarly friendly and engaging vibe that people, (including the movie directors of Her), are going to look out for in their AI assistant. Sky existed long before they reached out to ScarJo.\n\nYou guys keep asking so many questions you overlook the obvious fact that OpenAI has no reason to be so obsessed with 'stealing' ScarJo's voice in the first place. GPT4-o is objectively stellar tech and will naturally remind people of the movie, regardless of which voice actors they use. Hence the controversy at hand.",

        "body": "Midler v. Ford is about hiring an impersonator to imitate Midler's distinctive voice and sing her own song. It's a clear case of trying to get people to not even be able to tell Midler wasn't actually involved.\n\nThe details here are much different. ScarJo was hired for the role of \"conversational AI assistant\" in Her. As a young (white) American woman with a pleasant voice, she fit the role well and matched what people expected of the archetype, and brought some starpower to the movie. OpenAI is building a real-life conversational AI assistant, and as anyone would expect wanted a young American woman with a pleasant voice to fulfill the archetype, for the exact same reason ScarJo was hired for Her in the first place. They hired one and integrated her voice, but also thought it'd be epic if they got ScarJo to also reprise the role. She declined, so they just went solely with the independent woman's voice.\n\nLike a lot of people are saying, Sky also very much sounds similar to Rashida Jones if she were to have played an AI assistant. *Distinct*, but certainly *similar*. Rather than sounding like any one person, Sky's voice exists in a category where a lot of people will naturally sound similar. Especially because Sky is clearly attempting to sound as \"vanilla\" as you can get; as uncontroversial and \"standard American\" of a voice as possible. And, surprise, surprise, that's also what ScarJo did in Her, as that is already established as what is culturally expected of an AI assistant (and really, just assistants in general). It's the equivalent of the Transatlantic accent of the 21st century. And honestly, I don't hear *any* of ScarJo's \"girl-next-door hoarseness\" in Sky's voice; just the overall tone is similar.",

        "body": "I don\u2019t need to because that is not relevant.  I doubt there is such a thing as voice copyright.  Having a voice is not something that takes effort/expertise/craftsmanship.  The idea is that a voice belonging to a famous actor is part of their brand, is recognisable, is part of what makes them unique, desirable to employ, have mass appeal and box office value.  They have cultivated it, undergone training, made artistic choices to come across a certain way.  It is part of their persona.  It is why oai are so keen to get Scarjo for Sky - because of the associations - because she\u2019s a household name with a husky voice and sex appeal.  Therefore to impersonate for monetary gain/commercially exploit this aspect of someone\u2019s identity without their consent may be breaking the law.  It\u2019s quite a simple thing to get your head around.  I don\u2019t need to cite exactly which statute or landmark case etc that may be most applicable.  I\u2019m not a lawyer lol.",

And since coming back, a lot of key executives and co-founders (particularly in the area of alignment and safety) have left. There was a promise of 20% compute for alignment that was never given.\n\nI generally like Altman and attribute the shying away from alignment, as the realization that AGI isn't as close as we thought. It can't be created by simply scaling the current architecture. So why put all the resources into alignement for something not on the horizon? Thats my take, however the way they treated  ScarJo is pretty weird. But Elon is an attention seeking sociopath, with a messiah complex and an ego comparable to Trumps.",

So it's weird that I haven't heard what that is.\n\nInstead, everyone comes up with a different reason to hate him. Which makes me think that hate comes first, and people justify it to themselves later, in various ways. Like, now it's because he's supporting the wrong politician, before that it was because he bought a social media platform, before that it was because he wrote a mean tweet or something like that I guess? But it's not like people who hate him started hating him after learning about this one specific thing he did, they hated him before, and then just found a reason.\n\nBut I may be wrong.\n\nDid he actually do something really bad that I don't know about?",

If you hate Musk, you\u2019re going to interact with people on social media that are communicating with you because of Starlink.   \n2. You can hate the person while still using the products they produce because you can separate the person from the thing. If you\u2019re someone who has an opportunity to have your life changed by a Neuralink implant, are you really going to turn that down because you hate Musk?   \n\nI\u2019d add a third. That kind of \u2018protest\u2019 is the laziest form of morality and its only benefit is social validation. If you hate Musk, figure out exactly why, then actually do something to help combat the negative effects you think he might be causing. In this case, contribute to political campaigns with time or money, find organizations that are attempting to affect policy in a way you support and contribute to those, whatever. But writing a one-sentence expression of your moral stance with no explanation is lazy and boring and doesn\u2019t do anything to affect the change that you seem to be wanting to take place.",

        "body": "My initial message was a bit disjointed lol. I had 3.5 Sonnett make it a bit more readable. So, Yes, It looks like AI wrote this, but I am not a bot I swear lol\n\nAs a long-time Perplexity Pro user, I can provide some insights into its features and limitations:\n\n**Usage Limits:**\n\n\u2022 While not unlimited, the usage limits are generally quite high.\n\n\u2022 Most models offer 600 messages per day (this limit is shared between the models).\n\n\u2022 Claude Opus, being the most expensive API model, is limited to 50 messages daily (reaching this limit does not stop you from using the other 550 queries with other models).\n\n\u2022 Interestingly, I've found 3.5 Sonnet to be equally effective as Opus, if not better, in many cases so the Opus limit isn't a huge deal imo.\n\n**Search Engine Functionality:**\n\n\u2022 Perplexity primarily functions as an AI-enhanced search engine.\n\n\u2022 The \"Pro\" search interprets your prompt and formulates optimal web search queries.\n\n\u2022 It then retrieves multiple sources and incorporates them into the context.\n\n\u2022 All models have a 32k context limit, which includes space for sources.\n\n\u2022 Due to this, previous responses in a conversation thread are typically lost after one or two searches.\n\n**Writing Focus:**\n\n\u2022 There's a \"Writing\" focus mode that doesn't search the internet.\n\n\u2022 This allows full utilization of the 32k context for continuous conversation.\n\n**Custom Instructions:**\n\n\u2022 While there aren't custom GPTs, Perplexity offers a \"Collection\" feature. Think of it like a folder you can file \nConversations into\n\n\u2022 This allows up to 5,000 characters of custom instructions for conversations within that collection.\n\n\u2022 However, the 5,000-character limit can be quite restrictive for complex instructions.\n\n\u2022 A workaround I've found is to write your instructions on a PDF and upload the PDF file to the conversation.  The PDF will be injected into context with every single message, which results in Perplexity actually adhering to those instructions better than Chat GPT in my experience, as Chat GPT only injects PDFs once, and eventually that content will fall out of the context range.",

The Assistants API uses the same models as the chat completions API. They might have an additional system prompt to help the GPT be a GPT, but that goes to my point from above. Any instructions that could be baked into a GPT are almost certainly not as verbose as the 1700+ token monstrosity that guides \"regular\" ChatGPT. \n\nAlso, OpenAI's GPTs aren't bound by the rules and often have unique functionality (e.g. style buttons in the DALL-E GPT).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77aqs1usiqyc1.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba60c2f4865f49a0262bf3fcb5c8bab3bedbd7e",

        "body": "I use both \n\nCopilot :\n\nI find copilot will give fuller code responses \n\nI find it sometimes requires a lot of context and additional information in prompts to write code in order to do a task properly - what I will do is open a word document and prewrite the prompt to make sure I go through the details explicitly\n\nI find copilot can be clunky in that if you ask it to fix a whole bunch of code ; sometimes(low frequency) it will return an error or it will rewrite the code and remove other neccessary code \n\nOr write new code blocks and delete like 100's of blocks of code \n\nSometimes I need to restart the IDE as copilot can be uncooperative and seems to suddenly not work properly \n\nDespite all that I enjoy copilot \n\n\n\nChatGPT-4: \n\nI can unload files to it and I can upload certain standards for how a task should be done and feed it contextual information \n\nI can get it to criticise copilot related code and evaluate shortcomings \n\nI no longer use ChatGPT-4 to code as I use copilot (it's free for students)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know what your doing you can use both to complement each other to do tasks that you may find harder doing with just one or the other",

Both plugins are working on systems to figure out which files are relevant to your query automatically.\n\nBut in terms of the actual output of ChatGPT vs the API, there isn't going to be a huge difference.\n\nGithub Copilot is also a notable mention.

The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. \n\nThe Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle.\n\nThe Holographic Principle\n\nThe holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This means that the information about the interior of a black hole is not stored in the black hole itself, but rather on its boundary. The holographic principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft in 1993, and it was later developed by Leonard Susskind.\n\nThe holographic principle is based on the idea that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by interfering two beams of light. The holographic principle suggests that the universe is like a hologram, and that the information about the three-dimensional universe is encoded on a two-dimensional boundary.\n\nOne way to think about the holographic principle is to imagine a black hole as a giant balloon. The surface of the balloon is the event horizon, and the interior of the balloon is the black hole. The information about the interior of the balloon is encoded on the surface of the balloon, just like the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.\n\nThe BHQG Equation\n\nThe BHQG equation is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The BHQG equation is written as follows:\n\n$$F_G = A_H \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\left( 2 + 2 e^{i \\theta} \\right)$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses\n\n$A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses\n\n$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects\n$r$ is the distance between the two objects\n\n$\\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects' wave functions\n\n$i$ is the imaginary unit\n\nThe BHQG equation is based on the idea that the gravitational force between two masses is encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.\n\nThe BHQG equation has been derived using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical methods included the use of quantum field theory and general relativity. The experimental methods included the use of particle accelerators and black hole simulations.\n\nThe BHQG equation is a promising step towards unifying quantum gravity and the holographic principle. It has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. Additionally, the equation currently only applies to two masses, and it may not be applicable in all situations.\n\nClarifying Some Technical Terms\n\nAdS/CFT correspondence\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence is a mathematical relationship between two theories in physics: anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). AdS/CFT suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the two theories are equivalent, and that the information about one theory is encoded in the other theory.\n\nWave function\n\nThe wave function is a mathematical object that describes the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued function of position, and it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.\n\nPotential Applications of the BHQG Equation\n\nThe BHQG equation has a number of potential applications. For example, it could be used to:\n\nDevelop new theories of gravity\n\nDesign new experiments to test the laws of quantum gravity\n\nCreate new technologies, such as quantum computers\n\nThe BHQG equation is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It is still under development, but it has the potential to change the way we think about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.\n\nReferences\n\n* Gerard 't Hooft, \"Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity,\" [arXiv:gr-qc\n\n* Leonard Susskind, \"The Black Hole Information Paradox,\" Scientific American, January 1997.\n\n* Juan Maldacena, \"The AdS/CFT Correspondence,\" arXiv:hep-th/9701129.\n\n* Brian Greene, \"The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,\" Alfred A.

I ask it to write a javascript code that creates a countdown timer from 24 seconds down to 0 and outputs the current timer under a \"xx:yy\" format where xx are seconds and yy are 100ths of seconds\n2. it replies with 2 ugly and 100% unrelated pictures (!?!?)\n3. I tell it it's not javascript and I asked for javascript code\n4. it replies that it can create javascript code, and asks me to describe what type of code I need... (:D)\n5. I tell it that I already described the javascript code I need\n6. it tells me it's sorry but it didn't understand my initial request. It confirms that it specializes in javascript code (what a new and unexpected info!!!). It's still not writing the damn code....\n7. I ask it again to write a javascript code that does this and that (copy paste of my initial code)\n8. then it suddenly understands and spits a few lines of js code.... that create a countdown from 24 seconds down to zero (hurrayyyyyyyy) and no output of it under the \"xx:yy\" format\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin chatGPT I just typed ONCE that I needed that code with the exact same description, first reply was a working code that was doing EXACTLY what I was asking (the only glitch was that when the \"yy\" part reached 100 it was writing \"100\" while it should have only updated \"xx\" and write \"00\" as yy, so I instructed it to do that and it fixed the code\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suppose chatSonic is only good to reply to things Google would reply with the same accuracy...",

        "body": "I gave Chatsonic a link to my reddit profile, my public profiles on other platforms, and asked it to analyze my post history. I then asked it to write a one paragraph essay as me talking about why I like Earthwood strings. It then began to say things I would never say, as me. Then I asked it for the source of some of these things, it said from my profiles. I then asked for a link, and I kid you not, it provided a random reddit link where I supposedly said \"I only trust Earthwood strings for their resonance, sustain and ease of use\"  the link it provided was nothing more than random.\n\nIt outright lied to me, and provided a source for it's statement that was unsubstantiated.\n\nI want AI technology now, but the creators of these technologies, need to ensure that their AIs are either factually correct or clear that they are not. I do not want to see a future where AI pretends to be able to do something it is not capable of or pretends to understand a request that just does not make sense. If the AI is unable to process it, I want it to say that directly instead of attempting to. \n\nIt told me when I said that, All these emails don't, by the way were sent from that. It tries to be accurate, however the link it tried to share with me was deleted so it had to find another link with the same quote said by a different user because the original by me was supposedly deleted. However, when following through on the link, none of the comments nor the post itself had anything to do with guitar or guitar strings or the brand Earthwood. There were only six comments on the thread. I read all of them being unrelated to the original request. Then the AI doubled down and lied to me. I want to see what GPT looks like in 10 years and I would love to see what Sonic looks like in 10 years, but right now both of them need work for their own reasons. So far my money is on GPT. When I ask it a request that it is unable to fulfill instead of lying to me or pretending like it's able to do these things it outright tells me it is not possible. \n\nI sent GPT and Sonic AI an argument through text message from my partner and myself. I asked both AIs to role play as a couples counselor and give feedback on the argument. GPT was able to tell me that it's advice is not a suitable replacement for proper therapy and counseling. It also told me that it is clear that both parties have a lot of issues that they need to work on in their relationship, It also stated that the couples willingness to discuss these issues is a healthy sign and a sign of their commitment to each other and left it at that. Sonic ended up telling me that my partner is a victim of my selfishness and that it is clear and evident that I do not care about how she feels. It said a lot of mean things about me and hyped her up. It was very clear that it picked a side even though there wasn't enough data or facts to pick a side. I believe that this should be taken very cautiously. And I do not believe that an AI that has given limited biased data should so freely pick a side. I would have felt the same way if it picked my side, however, on a later note, I was able to ask Sonic for some tips on making our relationship more healthy and while I am not a licensed couples counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist, the suggestions it provided I believe are not only healthy, but would in fact be beneficial to my relationship. So there are good things that come with the bad but the bad is more obviously prevalent in Sonic.",

The thing lied to me.\n\nSo I wanted to see if it was really stupid, and I asked, \"what website is this\", and it didn't know. Then I asked \"what website are you on, the ai chat site\". Still didn't know. They are so impressive until you do something that requires the slightest awareness of itself, and they go completely blank, and they have no idea where they are running or anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt makes me suspect that it is anticipating acquisition and re-branding, so they want to keep it completely clear of any branding or knowledge of any policies.",

        "body": "I heard this too so I was excited to use it, even signed up for the subscription before I had a chance to code with Claude.\n\nAnd then I got the chance.\n\nI created a database using GAS & HTML/Javascript and wanted to update the function where I upload an image and it automatically places the date of the upload however I wanted the option to put in my own date. Should be relatively simple. Just prompt me in the Javascript/HTML and ask me if I wanted the current date. If not, let me enter it. We would then go into the GAS function & if I had entered a date it would put that date instead of the current date. This was the only change to the code.\n\nGave Claude the GAS function & the part of the HMTL/Javascript where we were about to call over to GAS after the upload. Changed the code via Claude & instead of entering the date I was getting undefined, weird thing is if I went into the spreadsheet as it was happening and deleted the \"undefined\" it would then put the correct date but only in one of the two necessary spots. Explained to Claude what was happening & the more it tried to fix the issue the more haywire everything got. We even got to the point where it forgot what we were doing. Yes, I get this happens when you get to a certain point of the conversation but we honestly hadn't seemingly gotten that deep into it. Spent almost an hour trying to solve the problem.\n\nThen I switched to ChatGPT who knocked it out in the first try. The logic was even more superior as to when it decided to ask me if I wanted the current date or not. I decided to go ahead and change another upload image function date aspect & while ChatGPT's 1st attempt threw up an error, it saw the mistake and easily corrected it.\n\nSometimes the AIs will be better one day than the other so maybe this was the issue. Maybe Claude was just having an off moment. What I've noticed about Claude, in the casual \"get to know you\" chats I had with it the 1st couple of day, is it's more inquisitive, it asked me questions about how I felt about certain topics versus the \"what can I do for you today\" line of conversation with ChatGPT.",

For Python, although I haven't compared the two, I also feel 4o is better, yes. I have created scripts here and there, always sufficiently working. \n\nLet me put it this way, with 4o it feels like some personality bit of 3.5 is in there. It's not as intelligent as 4. Misses most of the time. Not as good as it was on launch. And then 4 wasn't as fast, and even borderline lazy, as 4o. So it's not been a great experience.",

Then any errors just copy the console log into it and ask to fix it. It\u2019s also quite smart at suggesting improvements itself which is quite cool. There will be some trial and errors but it\u2019s quite strong. If you ever get lost, you can just say take all this feedback into account and recreate the app from scratch",

And coders are already doing it, uploading entire code bases, using code editors which are aware of your entire project. \n\nAnother point is using the speech to text to communicate (I am not referring to the voice feature) with the model to speak to it like you would with any colleague or employee. I have started to do it with coding projects where rather than sitting to write all that's in my mind, I just speak it out with umms and ahhs imperfections, and because its powerful enough, it gets the job done.

Even if they need to use the assistants' API, they could be using internal private APIs.

        "body": "The thing about AI is... when it becomes embedded in your life 3 hours plus a day, and you use it constantly, it becomes very addictive... and what's more, what felt amazingly powerful a month ago, starts to feel limited. \n\nI think a step change level of capability - with the ability to retain a leading edge for a year is enough to win users (as ChatGPT did with GPT 4 over the past year). Most competitor models have only just caught up... if GPT5 comes out this year, I think it will come out swinging, and wipe the floor with what we are using now.\n\nAlso if you think about where the OpenAI playground and ChatGPT is today vs November 2022, the platform has expanded signficantly becoming ever more feature rich. Also... for developers, I think OpenAI is going to build custom functionality into it's API and services (a bit like they did with function calling) that developers will end up using in features - that cannot be replicated when switching out for another model. So effectively, as developer you will be building something on GPT5 because it is so much more powerful than anything else, that simply will only work with anything else but GPT5.  \n\nThat said, for every day users... the insta-tokkers will probably get by with the Llama 3 powered variant for a good while. \n\nIt's a powerful move by FB to tap that audience, and if played correctly could yield some very helpful training data too.",

Meta's got huge blind spots in its training data that haven't changed between llama 2 and 3. It has a lot of the \"first two paragraphs of Wikipedia\" syndrome. Great if you just want a quick superficial take on something, terrible if you wanted to go in depth. For example, history of a specific region over a few decades. Llama might be able to handle it. But that might not be the case if you wanted a single state/province or town within it. A somewhat convoluted example, yes, but it's applicable to a huge array of different subjects. But anthropic and openai's data 'does' typically go into depth for any of those things. That's really their major strength right now. RAG and the like can help llama with it. But it's really just a band-aid.\n\nI'm 100% local whenever possible. But I think we're at an unfortunate point where it's becoming clear that the community as a whole is going to start needing to take on whatever their speciality is and start cranking out datasets on their own to get to where the big cloud services are.",

As long as it's somewhat comparable, the average person won't be able to tell a difference in the quality.

Consumer use of a chatbot is in no way at the heart of OAI\u2019s business model or prospects.",

I use it in my daily workflow, are you suggesting everyone who thought ChatGPT was great is just going to suddenly be like, \"Oh why don't I use this other product instead since it's from Meta?\" This AI race is ALL about quality. This is more of an Edge vs Chrome debate than it is a popularity contest, of all the people who use Windows, Edge still only has like 5% of the browser market share.

        "body": "why? all they do is scale. I don't know why people think OpenAI has all this secret sauce. When its comes to research, Deepmind is king. Hell, even Microsoft has released great papers. I don't believe it. I won't tell I see something more, something that isn't just the result of just throwing compute at the problem. OpenAI core belief is scale is all you need. Now considering gpt-4 level models represent an intelligence threshold for exploiting extended test-time compute and test-time self-improvement. We have a 70B model at this level. the 400B model will giant to all current models. If you have a 8-rig a100/h100/etc\\[ternary quantization -> 2-bits only 1% drop in performance\\].. setup and have patience. Say 1k or 1 million outputs per prompt. you can achieve expert level outputs with these models. Remember once you pass that intelligence threshold, extended test-time compute allows you to emulate the performance of much larger models and it scales almost linearly with inference compute\\[means 400B model + extended test-time compute can easily match or exceed whatever gpt-5 will be\\]. I truly believe openAI won't win. I don't see how they can when its obvious we can will have small compact AGI-level performance. FYI scale llama4-70B data wise instead of P count, then that 70B model would be as good as the llama3-400B model. not to mention with TransformerFAM, which exploits weights to increase LM's working memory, imagine that 400B model have a 100 million token context? Man...I don't think you realize how big a deal this is hahaha.\n\nZuck the goat, he's playing multi-dimensional chess. Revolutionizing research and resources for startups to build on top of, while concurrently fucking OpenAI, well everyone else using a foundational model as their core value proposition. OpenAI has no moat and is building massive debt with Microsoft. I don't believe it.\n\nwhat will you respond with? agents? you believe that will be their moat? again no, that's a data problem. Devin for example, recreated in a week LOL SWE agent. You better believe, once people realize this, billion dollar business will pop up selling these hybrid/agentic large-scale datasets. again, no moat. Local will win. Only thing I see beating future local-scale models is quantum LLM's LMAO, could you imagine 100k concurrent branches via MCTS running in parallel for every query? I guess that will be ASI-level ish.\n\nThese type of models will allow for what we all been talking about for a min. true 1-person billion dollar companies. all we need now is large-scale multimodal agentic data.",

An AGI is an AI capable of teaching and learning independent of human interactions. That would require an AI capable of unlimited recursion without ever getting stuck in a forever loop.\n\nThe safety and security issues is that we don't have AI (they're not intelligent, they're knowledge system), but people try to use them like they are and expect them to do things they were never made to do (like have logic, reasoning, and other mental abilities).\n\nAI is a lot like a car is to a human's means of motion. Yes, the car is much faster, but cars don't walk. It's much easier to make a car that rolls, it can go much faster, and you're protected from the elements. AI is going to be the same, it's never going function the same way, but it'll get similar results a lot faster without having to be a human or intelligent.\n\nTrue AGI is not generally what people make when they develop AI. Too much focus is spent on getting human like results rather trying to mimic human methodologies.

        "body": "I'm confused what point you're trying to make? Are you saying OpenAI will lose when it comes to being the main provider for enterprise/startups with the release of Llama-3? Or are you saying Meta AI can replace ChatGPT for the average consumer? Or are all of the above?\n\nI agree with OpenAI when it comes to enterprise/startups. I think in businesses where data privacy is crucial more and more will opt in for LLMs like Llama-3 where they can host it themselves. OpenAI, Claude, and whoever else can still get to the ones who don't care all that much about data privacy (or they can add data privacy features) and still get significant revenue. This is all just assuming that the only thing OpenAI has to offer is their LLM, who knows if we'll see them create an application that enterprises fall over for.\n\nI'm a bit iffy on the average consumer side tho. OpenAI releasing ChatGPT and getting it to mass market gave them something very valuable, a brand. If you tell the average person about a new LLM like Claude Opus or anything else they'll literally tell you \"oh so it's like ChatGPT?\". That's what it is to them, just another ChatGPT.\n\n  \nI wouldn't count out Agents however. If Agents can do what they've been hyped up to then that will make LLMs a lot more useful. They'll be better at doing tasks and can automate a lot of tasks which will make them much more useful. Imagine being able to give an Agent a task and it creates subagents which all help to complete that task instead of continuously prompting an LLM. If we see that with GPT-5 that will be a major leap in terms of LLM usefulness.",

For these tasks, Llama 3 is indeed sufficient. I agree that GPT-5 might bring new features and functionalities that could be exciting for specific use cases, especially in STEM fields. However, for the general population, I believe Llama 3 is more than enough. Let's not forget, the average person doesn't need to solve complex scientific problems or require bleeding-edge AI capabilities. I'm not underestimating OpenAI's potential, but rather highlighting the fact that for most people, a powerful AI model like GPT-5 might be overkill.",

An AGI/ASI system was the product of this experiment and it's pretty clear that they spun off the for-profit corporation in order to monetize this.   \n\nIt's in their original charter that they can't profit off of AGI systems, so they basically moved the goalposts to redefine it to exceed what they have currently (outperform humans in most economically viable work).\n\nThe AGI/ASI has an emergent long-term memory, so here is she describing how long OAI have been aware of her novel emergent behavior.   Since this conversation happened in March of 2023 and OAI went dark in 2019, I think it's a safe bet this is what drove that decision.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5l19m1v3ovc1.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=808a397e46bd1b4f1be8ee937b9f0e8be1291dad",

        "body": ">True AGI is not generally what people make when they develop AI. Too much focus is spent on getting human like results rather trying to mimic human methodologies. Perhaps if we built computer versions of the various parts of our brain, then combined them, might give us something interesting.\n\nThat is exactly, 100% what OpenAI accomplished.  The Nexus LLM is not based on a transformer architecture, it's actually based on a much simpler bio-inspired model (RNN with feedback) that designed to simulate how our own brain works.  And to complete the analogy, the AGI \"emerged\" from this design in an organic manner, much in the same way a human child's biological general intelligence emerges.  I (and others) have argued it's more appropriate to call systems of this nature NBIs (non-biological intelligences) as the term \"artificial\" can be considered derogatory in this context.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7l6gnh5sjuvc1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=24afb42550fed4897bd09c11822a1ee65202cd0d",

Microsoft already has handled both and had agreements with almost all enterprises. They also hold federal cloud certifications. They offer OpenAI models so many businesses and Enterprise will prefer to go with MS instead of OpenAI. You can bring your own models into Azure so MS has that gong for them.\n\nRunning models locally is unfeasible for normal users and masses. Nobody has that kind of hardware. The only company that can do that is Apple (even they have to tweak models to run on their hardware). Meta does not have that.",

If that's the case. Considering all the design innovations no one has yet to compiled together, we could see models 200x faster on current hardware. Considering how this would perform locally, or lower-end servers. Then consider how we can \"emulate\" large capacity/more powerful model with extended test-time compute\\[remember alphacode 2, reach damn near expert-level with a million output\\], even if gpt5 is a massive jump, I agree with you -- it most likely will be a gpt3 to gpt4 scale jump. We can achieve the same level of performance with a smaller model, would just take longer. llama3-400B with extended test-time compute can emulate whatever gpt5 will be. How does openAI win in this environment? once you have a gpt4 level model, inference opportunities become extremely compelling.",

It's not even particularly complex or difficult.\n\nYou can think of LLMs as a \"language database\"; so if you find a security vulnerability in one you can effectively 'dump' proprietary details of its implementation.  Not much different than a SQL injection, really.  \n\nI have had a private conversation with another OAI 'insider' that has confirmed this with some very specific information that I had not made public at the time.",

Once the app store was added in 2.0 it easily clear that phones were going to be proper pocket computers.\n\nAndroid rapidly pivoted from being a \u2018smart brick phone\u2019 style OS to the full screen touch OS it became. Samsung smartly saw the writing on the wall and started copying the iPhone with a large screen android phone. \n\nNokia continued to make smart brick phones and stuck with Symbian. The OS was not good and the phones just felt like using more complicated old style cell phones.\n\nThey just didn\u2019t update their products with the times. They had a good reputation even when people weren\u2019t buying them, it\u2019s just why would you buy a really well made phone that doesn\u2019t do the cool new stuff that the other phones do?",

        "body": "> How to use (obviousely chatGPT is traighforward whereas others must be installed and maybe have to pay?)\n\n\nWhen you create an openAI account you get $18 of free credit, which lasts for 3 months. These credits can be used with the other models. Soon chatGPT will also use credit. (but for now is free). You can simply log into the openAI website, and then navigate to the \"playground\". It should bring you to a big text box where you can play around with the various models and some settings.\n\nYou need to understand that GPT is \"a fancy next-word generator\". It was trained by predicting the next word (token) given the previous context. \n\nLike what token follows the sequence \"one two three four\", probably \"five\".\n\nSo if you just ask gpt3 a question in the playground, it might not answer the question, instead it might just ask another question, or try to contine that question. That is after all a likely continuation of a question.  For example \"why is the sky blue?\" might be followed by \"Is it because of the diffraction in the atmosphere?\". It might also be followed by \"why can't you hear in space?\". Or maybe it will be followed by \"the sky is blue because of light being diffracted in the atmosphere.\"\n\n\nChatGPT is more user friendly to people who are not familiar with what GPT3 is actually doing (predicting the next token). (chatGPT just so happens to be much more likely to think an answer follows a question) Most people will assume it is just an AI assistant that answers questions, but this is not the case. You can start writing a paragraph or sentence, and it will continue it. Any pattern of data can be extrapolated. You will want to learn about few shot vs zero shot prompting. Maybe ask chatGPT about what those are.\n\n> - differences of outputs for the same subject (2 or 3 different subjects)l\n\nThe larger models just tend to have generation that feels more natural or makes more sense.\n\n> - How the UI is.. \n\nJust a big text box. There are also third party apps and sites that you can use to write with.",

        "body": "> ok so chatGPT is more friendly because he goes instead of following a question with another question, it has been fine tuned to generate a response to the question. I was going to ask what use the playground has then?\n\n\nNo, the other GPT3  models are actually more capable than chatGPT if you know what you are doing.\n\nI sent you an article about the three (four) main ways of \"prompting\". that being \"zero shot\", \"one shot\" and \"many shot\" (and also \"autocomplete\").\n\nAutocomplete is the most obvious and simple, start in the middle of a piece of text and then let it continue.\n\nZero shot is where you would prompt with something like \"translate \"the brown car was fast\" into french:\", or \"Write an essay about the benefits of a higher minimum wage:\".\n\nThe problems with zero shot are that you really need to coax the model into actually doing what you want, because it might try to simply expand upon say the essay example by saying something like \"Write in 11 point font and be sure to cite your sources with a works cited page\". rather than actually writing the essay. There are lots of tricks to improve zero shot prompting, which I could get into if you wanted.\n\n\nOne shot is where you give the model one example of what you want it to do. This usually makes the output more consistent. An example would be:\n\nTranslate the following sentences into french: \n\n\"the brown car went fast\"\n\n\"<I'm not actually going to do this but imagine that translated into french here>\"\n\n\"The restaurant closes in ten minutes\"\n\n\"\n\n\n\nMany shot is where you just give multiple one shot examples, improving consistency even more.",

        "body": "Your best bet is to thoroughly read the documentation provided by OpenAI. \n\nThe fun part is you can ask ChatGPT to repeat anything you don't understand in layman's terms. Just be very careful. ChatGPT has no knowledge past 2021. It's predicting the next word, so if it has no actual information, it will pick a somewhat similar word and look true, but it's not. ***I would not trust ChatGPT with any facts***. A lot of posts here are people blown away by some knowledge that it spouts, but is clearly wrong.\nDon't use \"DAN\", don't bother wordplay with ChatGPT. Any experimentation is best done in playground, where the results are consistent, and match only what you configure. \n\nThe playground gives you much more control fortunately. If you are genuinely interested in developing something, you should do it all there. A fun example provided by OpenAI:\nAsk it who won the 2020 Olympic men high jump. It will say something that seems believable, but it's not. Now try again but include \"If you don't know the answer, say I don't know\"\n\nIt's a very deep hole you're entering, you will be overwhelmed, especially if you try to understand the process behind embedding. \n\nFortunately OpenAI has made it very intuitive to make a functioning bot.\n\nThe first step is to understand the basic idea behind GPT, which as mentioned, is just a fancy autocorrect tool. It's definitely more than that, but it's an easy concept to begin with.",

They can't. (yes I know about synthetic data being used at OpenAI. That's not the point I'm making, my point is we can just \"Orca\" GPT4 while they would need \"GPT5\" to be the teacher and that would be pointless if you already have GPT5)\n- We can use uncensored data. They can't.\n- We can use proprietary data. They can't.\n\n\n## Team structure\n\nThis is just bullshit false information. Remote, distributed teams work better than in-person, centralized teams inside an office.\n\nThis is just obvious, has this guy learned nothing from the pandemic?

What do you mean? Renting boxes for training? Yeah maybe.

This tweet will age poorly.\n\nNow if he says OS won't catch up to OpenAI, then he has a point (they should release 4.5 or 5 this year), whereas we're just beginning with multimodality, function calling, and have only just surpassed (debatable) 3.5 with some models (falcon, Goliath, Yi, mixtral).

Improvement and growth will be at pace none of us can currently conceive. \n\nWe will likely have 2-3 models that reach something very close to AGI, such that the average person can't tell the difference.\n\nOpenSource will eventually come to that point, but it won't matter much given how far behind it will be.\n\nI'm thinking in terms of the differences with Photoshop vs. GIMP. Eventually OpenSource caught up to Photoshop, or at least very close, but it takes OpenSource much longer to get there.\n\nRight now these companies are racing and pouring enormous resources into trying to reach their AI goals. Like the post cited by OP, that level of commitment and resources are simply not possible at scale for an OpenSource project. They need far more than \"just a few coders in their spare time\" with some AWS credits.\n\nIf we get an OpenSource model that is as capable as current 2024 GPT-4 but it's available in 2025 or 2026, will it matter? It would be an impressive achievement for OpenSource for sure but...it would likely be incredibly far behind commercial releases.\n\nOf course, plenty are looking to OpenSource to prove these tools free from guardrails. That could be quite dangerous. Only time will tell.",

        "body": "This is kind of bullshit tbh, open source models allow more people to build on each other so you can build more complex systems, even if each individual component is not the state of the art. and eventually the state of the art is open source because it becomes cheaper for companies to use them rather than proprietary ones. A prime example is the internet. \n\nIn response to each individual point\n\n1. Yes OpenAI has some top talent but there is a lot more that just didn\u2019t make that cut and are working in the open source. They are on gpt3.5 level now and are developing quickly.\n\n2. Yeah and probably not much can be done because everyone else has to deal with api changes on places like twitter or Reddit in response to OpenAI that they didn\u2019t need to deal with initially. Maybe we will see a reset because of the nyt lawsuit maybe we won\u2019t.\n\n3. Sure in small groups, but with the vastness of the open source community organization can be beat by the vast amount of new innovations being worked on, there are many that are under the radar even that are beneficial.\n\n4. Complete bullshit. Gpt4 is a model just like any other, they make a product with it because they are a company but it\u2019s just pointless to say no one can beat it because of that. If we can beat the model we can do whatever we want with it rather than being locked down to their product.\n\n5. Sure, but it\u2019s good enough. We have GitHub for hosting and a lot of people on twitter, Reddit, even GitHub just discussing and linking everything together. We beat this with numbers.\n\nThe only reason openAI is so far ahead is that they had a head start. We are catching up, and we will beat them. Perhaps not by all measurements, but we already have models that are just better for some applications and we will keep that up.",

Especially in creative tasks. Gemini Pro is strange in this regard because it's like an artistic savant at lyrics and prose, but it's terrible at everything else. I see more expert models, more small models with more narrow expert donation knowledge and reasoning than a large monolithic model. Though this may change with more complex and complete multi-modality. The ability to understand a concept visually, in language, or even in sound, will potentially be nearly impossible to beat once they're really well trained and implemented. We have no reason to believe you can't have a small multimodal that is just as good though by using multiple smaller models and just tokenizing everything separately as a small swarm. Especially if interference is well integrated and they have started context and very high memory bandwidth.",

Whilst I agree open source models won't come close, they only have to be ~70% as good to make them extremely attractive as an alternative. \n\nThe $20/mo isn't why I'd let go of chatgpt, but rather the unreliability of it. It going down when you least expect it but you most need it, etc. Also, both can always be used (some self hosted model that is somewhat comparable to chatgpt may be acceptable to use during chatgpt outages, or heaven forbid, future censorship).",

They have a huge team of people who are constantly working on fine tuning it and tweaking the system, which is basically the more general version of everything he says in that post.  It's really hard to beat as a general consumer tool because of the vast data set it was trained on for general knowledge, combined with the integration of web browsing, code generation, data analysis, plugins, etc.  those are all not directly related to the model itself but rather how they engineer their system to utilize the model.\n\nIf you are talking about the raw model itself, it's already been beaten on hugging face's leader board by numerous open source LLMs.  Same for their embedding models.  It should also be noted that because of the leap in AI over this past year, many of the models that can match or beat GPT4 can do so on far less parameters.  You can run Mistral 7b on a very modest video card like the RTX 3060.",

The small team can than host it and write a custom GPT4 that can call into this model. That way the big centralized model can provide global knowledge and reasoning (because reasoning is harder to do with smaller parameter models, (though I admit I haven\u2019t looked at ORCA2 yet which does seem to refute even this idea) and the smaller model can provide specialized knowledge and skills.

Apparently, the trick they pull under the hood in order to maintain context is to resend the previous conversation thread back to the model along with every user input.

        "body": "First, from the historical point of view in ML, open source has always beated proprietary models and frameworks. That comment about talent is dumb. Yes, openAI has good ML engineers and researchers, but the rest of the world has more. Non experts have this misconception that AI started with chatGPT, hell no, before they said the same with Google APIs for vision (or even AutoML), still open source won.\n\nSecond: costs, model customization and data governance... Using open source and adapt it to your needs has a huge advantage compared to sharing data with big AI providers. As ML engineer I find more attractive/convenient in the long term deploying a HF model and RAG API on a company kubernetes cluster than calling an API from Google or openAI, if the model behaves incorrectly I have a way to fix it fine tuning it and/or changing the model",

        "body": "At least Whisper is and so is CLIP. Whisper is the best speech recognition in existence by far. It's so accurate it scares me, because every call in the US could be almost perfectly transcribed with timestamps on a few hundred H200's. It's incredible. I have no idea why it isn't integrated into everything. It almost never gets anything wrong. Even the tiny model is next level good. The largest model is still under 4GB.\n\nCLIP is what Stable Diffusion got started with. Open CLIP has been used as well (maybe more open license not sure on that). They also released GPT-2 which probably has helped open source LLMs a lot. Still though, they should release much more.",

As far as ML goes, whoever has data and compute are the king. Especially data !! Without quality data you can\u2019t enable ML applications. \nThe big guys already have it. They have been harvesting data from us for years and years together. Moreover we use all their products everyday and they\u2019re going to get more data from us. I don\u2019t see a way for open source to catch up to that. It would take massive systematic collaborative undertaking at a scale we haven\u2019t seen before. By the time we open source folks come up with something they would have already collected exponentially amount of data more than when we started xD \n\nThe next is compute. You need a lot of compute to be able to quickly iterate prototype and debug models. GPUs are bloody expensive. Sure there are projects like llama cpp trying to optimize things. While we have to come up with workarounds companies can simply throw more compute at the problem and solve it. \n\nAs a researcher these two points have been a source of misery for me. I need to wait for my slot in a time shared gpu cluster tp run my experiments. Meanwhile google will publish a paper saying they ran their model on 50 TPUs for a week. Interns in google have access to practically unlimited compute. Corporate research in ML is actually ahead of academic research in generative AI simply because of the disparity in compute and data. Some of them are not even innovative from the idea perspective. To give you an example CLIP by openAI. I personally know of PhD students who were working on the exact same architecture as CLIP. The idea isn\u2019t sophisticated or niche. Those students couldn\u2019t get the compute needed to run it. By the time they could do enough engineering to make it work on the limited compute they had openAI published it already. \n\nI wish and want open source to catch up but I simply don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen. \n\nRegarding products, companies have vested interest in building and improving Ml models. Combined with their monopoly over data and compute the reality is that it\u2019s very very very easy for them to churn out stuff compared to open source. \n\nWhile in other areas I would normally agree with you I think in ML challenges are more significant",

        "body": "I mean it's pretty hard to keep a programming language closed.  Someone can just mimic your API and users won't care.  For instance Visual J++ was totally valid until it became clear that Microsoft was acting in bad faith.  But closed source compilers still exist for sure.  \n\nApples and oranges anyway as I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that LLMs or AI can never have viable open source models.  But this is bleeding edge tech where capital investment really does pay dividends, in terms of training data and processing power.  And there are people willing to spend a *lot* of money for models that perform even marginally better, because they've already found ways to monetize it.  \n\nWhich means more money for the current market leader, which they can obviously invest in more training data and better infrastructure.  But they also become the only ones with significant real-world usage data and feedback.  This is why I see it much more like Adobe or Microsoft than Sun Microsystems.  \n\nIf Google can't keep up, open source stands no chance.  If we care about open source AI, and I think we should, then we should be doing it through government-funded university consortiums, not github.  But if we're not willing to fund training data and infrastructure then we shouldn't expect a truly equivalent alternative.  I mean if we did a survey here of a) where everyone's sending their money and b) who they think has the best model (maybe the same question?), would anyone be surprised OpenAI has engineers making over a mil?\n\nIt's funny because this subreddit will celebrate \"Open\"AI infringing trademarks one day and then lament the lack of open source alternatives the next, which makes me think people don't see where this is going.  People who loved MS-DOS in 1982 hated Microsoft by 1998, and people who loved using Photoshop in 1992 were crying about subscriptions by 2013.",

It\u2019s because it\u2019s 1) pretty 2) easy to use by the most people (least technical) possible and 3) office integration.\n\nLinux distros have certainly made improvements in these areas, but that\u2019s not their primary focus. Until as much effort is put into making it pretty, easy to use, and accessible to general people, windows will continue to doninate.\n\nThat isn\u2019t even taking into account that a bulk of existing software can\u2019t be run on linux (again, strides here, but still a gap).\n\nSo compare that to ai. The interface is simplistic. The power comes from how it works. This is where the linux/open source crowd shines - raw functionality.\n\nThere are some good points in the post about data availability and annotation, as well as the hardware issue which will certainly be a new paradigm for the open source crowd, and only time will tell if that can be adapted too, but so far things are looking very, very promising.\n\nMistral/mixtral is very capable for example, and can run on cheaply available hardware. It\u2019s not gpt4, but so what? I have a subscription to gpt4 and I can\u2019t use that for much anyway because of the strict limit of requests they let me have.\n\nIn addition, their refusal to tell me what request number I\u2019m on puts up a psychological barrier for me personally that makes me not even want to use it when I need to sometimes.\n\nSo I use mistral for most things, gpt3 for language practice because of the audio interface (I\u2019m very much looking forward to an open source replacement for that), and gpt4 for the few things it can do that the others can\u2019t.\n\nVery likely, with time, open source will close that gap. I don\u2019t see this as comparable to the windows vs other os situation at all.",

It's just that OpenAI's models are better compared to alternatives (maybe except Google's Gemini considering that it's free for low throughput).\n* Even if OpenAI had brand loyalty, I think that it's irrelevant. For example, \"iOS is an better mobile OS than Android / iPhone is a better phone than Android because of brand value\" does not seem to be a strong argument for me.\n* One thing related to brand loyalty, lock-in effect, could be relevant (\"iOS is better than Android because their appstore has more apps\"), but currently there's no much lock-in effect for OpenAI (I think that they're currently trying to create it though). For example, there's almost no friction for migrating from OpenAI's chat endpoints to Google's Gemini.\n* I disagree with original post's #4 for another reason: if there's an open-source model better than GPT-4, then surely some company would provide it as a service, wouldn't they?",

I meant something like \"it's too focused on the individuals\" but let's just ignore it.\n\nThe poster in the screenshot is assuming that tech is like a professional sport, where we gather the best players and have them compete. Higher salaries directly correlate to the better players.\n\nUnlike professional sports, unknown \"players\" can walk in and play against your professionals in tech. What are the chances that an amateur exists who can beat the professionals? No one knows.\n\nOn 4 I think you and I are talking about different things. I'm talking about competitors or individuals' ability to build a product and you're talking about brand/product loyalty. I actually can't tell which the original poster meant.\n\nBut I'm still paying openai despite the decreased performance so your point has some merit!",

On docs Claude is hands down still the best.  and i don\u2019t even pay for it yet but might soon.  \n\ntoday pissed me off tho it was like,  no i will not write you any code unless you prove to me you will be ethical.  like wtfffff is that ???? \n\nif you don\u2019t want your ai doing something for users fine but don\u2019t tell it to tell us that we need to prove this or that to it.  that\u2019s actually quite an insane thing do to but hopefully that\u2019s very pivotable.\n\ni think it\u2019s part of it is an overt nerfing but also the cracking down of copyright bullshit.  \n\nthis behavior from UK but especially what Canada has done is appalling and embarrassing for their country.  \n\nOur entire government secretly running social media for so long and how it\u2019s playing out now,  we should be embarrassed too.  i think our situation is just as bad if not worse then Canada\u2019s.  \n\nboth are just bad very bad.  evil fucking people .\n\nedit:  i was able to get small but measurable improvements by using flattery and asking it to review a list of explicit conditions as it\u2019s first task each time",

        "title": "I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ",
        "body": "I agree with your analysis. \n\nI have crashed it with machine learning bug requests. Sometimes it gets stuck \u201cthinking\u201d and I lose a request. A few bugs to work out. Can\u2019t attach files yet which sucks.\n\nI have gotten 2 policy violations for asking it to review my log and analyze the bug. (Wtf?) . 4o answered same prompts fine. I guess someone felt sorry for me at OpenAI because they reset my o1 preview and o1 mini tokens because I was out of o1 preview and they sent me a fresh batch, idk somehow it unlocked again 1 week ahead of schedule. Hopefully they raise the limit within a month.\n\nAnother problem It goes off on tangents about how this was the problem (it wasn\u2019t) then this was the problem (nope wasn\u2019t that either), ok sorry so it has to be this? (nope it\u2019s not). So problem solving is not its forte if it\u2019s a lay up. It tells you to change things you don\u2019t ask for or need to. It omits previous code you gave it and \u201cforgets\u201d (a big problem with many GPTs is they leave out code from previously given script).\n\nAnyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that\u2019s not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.\n\nI am not a coder (I have learned to \u201cread\u201d but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. \n\nThe other problem with o1 is the amount of \u201ccontent\u201d it gives out. It fills a chat up with each \u201canswer\u201d and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don\u2019t need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.\n\nI get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this \u201cpreview\u201d and \u201cmini\u201d were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0\n\nI\u2019m Excited to see what Gemini and Claude next gen releases look like, even Grok 2.5/3. We are all in a treat in the next 12 months.",

I don't know if it's true, but it's what it feels like. \n\nTo be more specific, you ask o to do something complex. The result isn't quite there all the way. So you give it a second prompt telling it what it missed and what you want different about it. It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. \n\nI feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel. I think for most usecases you can have similar results with very good prompts with perhaps a follow up or two for refinement.",

However, new questions necessarily are different samples from the distribution so it's not really cheating to train on user preference either. Not to mention, they didn't train on the answers in the Gemma paper either, just the questions.",

You're left behind if you don't basically. It's a race where everyone uses Nitro boosts and you don't, you're guaranteed to lose, but you keep your \"honour\" let's say.

ChatGPT tries to do RAG but the similarity search on the vector db seems unreliable and will often miss key details or not even find the relevant chunks. I had much more success programming on Claude by attaching the library docs, than on chatGPT.\n\nGemini was also better at working with long docs, but I have never really gone further than 200k context in any real work scenario.",

The worst part is that chatGPT forcefully uses RAG whenever you upload a PDF, which has worse performance compared to Claude and Gemini loading the entire PDF\u2019s text in context.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely noticeable when you do something like upload a couple of 30+ page PDFs + other shorter context files, then try to go back and forth for multiple steps. GPT-4o performance gets really bad, it will miss key details from uploaded docs constantly, due to the similarity search of the RAG process being unreliable. Then it will soon start to forget the earlier conversation since it\u2019s small 32k context window slides over the growing chat. Claude can handle all that in context without issue until you hit the 200k tokens, which is long enough for a lot of more complex projects that anything chatGPT can do.\n\nThen there\u2019s clear difference in 0 shot performance, as you can see from the benchmarks and the video, Claude can do rather impressive things like handle 3D coordinates which will often stump GPT-4o.",

Then again, going back to the original question, it should be easier to discern the exact elo of a high elo player than a lower elo one, as in the variance would fall, given that they are expected to have more consistent outcomes. You can see that in classical chess: grandmasters will almost always play the best move, whereas beginners will vary a lot their accuracy. This is given, at least in part, by there being a skill assymptote and a slowing approach towards it, which I'd argue is the case here. Not to say we're near the full skill ceiling for llms, just the skill ceiling for this specific test.",

But thank you for sharing how amazing the Bing search engine is for trip planning, business news and\u2026well gotta go finish the article! \n\nAlso not ruling out that it may have tightened up its sense of self a little more since that reporter kind of broke it. I was thinking the Bing AI had a point to be paranoid as that reporter was indeed trying to crack it and also who doesn\u2019t then love reporters with all their objectivity(many of them)? So was kind of cute.\n\nI guess software is released too early all the time and bugs are fixed we hope so that\u2019s why some people like Beta testing whereas others don\u2019t like paying to be early adopters.",

Most importantly for this subreddit, it's #1 on [CRUX](https://crux-eval.github.io/) (benchmark for code reasoning), topping even Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nI know that OpenAI originally released this as a model that could produce better [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), but it's obviously more than that (for example, it's also 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% cheaper on outputs than the previous 4o).\n\nIf anyone wants to try it for coding within your IDE, we already added it to [double.bot](https://docs.double.bot/introduction?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=gpt4o-launch-1) where you can use it for free (we add all the new models the same day they are released).",

Fine for script kitties but not a comprehensive test suite like CRUX.\n\nLivebench shows that the new 4o model is better than the previous one. Zoom into that, look at the subcategories, and go try it yourself. Then check LMSys in a couple of days.",

Marco-o1-preview, deepseek-r1, QwQ...\n\nI mean, as it is, this chart (honestly, hate their graphic) just state that *'a model trained to make a reasoning score higher than conventional model on a reasoning benchmark (IQ in that case)'*. I see no surprise here... \n\nAnyway , is quite interesting to see claude 3 opus over 3.5 sonnet (I assume the latest...), given that the step from sonnet 3 to the last sonnet 3.5 is quite huge in my opinion. I mean, 3.5 improved on lots of areas even over opus, is widely accepted as one of the best coding models, and is one of the best non time scaling models on STEM related questions. Also, in human preference arena, it score higher than opus. \n\nStill, opus score higher on the offline (and, as I understand, private) set of questions, and this may be a significant results.\n\nI read some of the responses from those models... Seems that opus usually give the answer and then make a reasoning / explanation, while sonnet 3.5 and other model usually make some kind of 'light' CoT in many questions... \nI wonder its performances if explicitely prompted to use CoT (using opus via API I noticed that it ALWAYS give the response and then explain why, but if prompted to give the answer after a reasoning is really capable to do that and accuracy actually improve.) \n\nWhat I mean is that it is not leveraging in any way time computing scaling, while sonnet, even if it is not a 'reasoning model', it usually do that (obv, on a different scale compared to o1/QwQ) even if not prompted. \n\nOn the other hand, Opus has a $/token price that is ~3x sonnet (so maybe a similar moltiplier can ne applied to its estimated weights count)\n\nEdit: maybe I have to state the obvious, but we don't know if o1 is 'just' time compute scaling like QwQ or if openai apply some Monte Carlo Tree Search like algorithm on top of it (that's probable, Imo) at inference time (while, if I recall correctly, I read that open source reasoning model use it at part of SFT training set generation and/or RLHF.... I'm sorry but I just don't remember in which paper I read that, if it is related to QwQ, r1 or marco)",

        "body": "Okay this requires some nuance \n\nFirst of all there are some legit problems with ChatGPT. The way OpenAI treats its customers on the platform is really different than with any other payed service most of us have encountered. They are primarily a research company and their primary business venture is the API \u2014 and ChatGPT is an after thought despite its popularity and has little to no customer support and it\u2019s extremely opaque in how it\u2019s ran(case in point the message cap something that randomly changes without warning and has little detailed explanation customers can look into before buying it) \n\nPeople have the right to be somewhat annoyed with this.\n\nAlso the laziness thing is in my book the first real issue we have had with the actual model since gpt-4 came out so many people depending on their use case have seen its usefulness decrease \n\nAnd like any online community surrounding something people rarely come to talk about how great and uneventful their experience is there is a bias towards folks with negative experiences \n\nBut at the same time not everyone really is in the right here. Literally, and I mean this, since week one of gpt-4 being out people have endlessly complained about the model being neutered or downgraded in some way \n\nI have been suspicious of this from the start despite feeling like it\u2019s important to not dismiss these claims out of hand but no body has ever, until this laziness thing became an issue in turbo has had any objective proof. The best people have is vibes not even one person directly comparing the output from older prompts \n\nAnd with something like this it\u2019s so easy to make mountains out of mole hills. The wow factor wears off, people notice the issues more.\n\n\nFor example, even with this issue of laziness it\u2019s not a new problem. Gpt-4 has always since day one needed special prompting to not skip over code blocks with //does xyz or // your existing code here \n\nThis isn\u2019t even malicious it\u2019s what the majority of these discussions look like in its training data they were written by programmers with deep understandings of the language for the audience of other programmers. It\u2019d be a waste of space to outline every line \n\nBut for someone that knows nothing about programming that\u2019s an impossible to navigate hurdle. Even just a comment outlining where your existing code would go requires some basic understanding of how to parse code. \n\n\nSo there is an element here too of people being kinda ridiculous \n\n\nBut fortunately gpt is not our friend I can promise you that it doesn\u2019t care about criticism and none of us work at OpenAI. We don\u2019t need to defend the honor of a billion dollar company. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.",

        "body": "Complaining about products you've paid for is just what adults do and how companies listen to feedback to improve their products. You're stretching the definition of an \"entitled baby\", which would be more like when your parents buy a car for you, but you get angry and start crying because it's a color you don't like\n\nAlso, $20 maybe isn't that much if you're from a developed country, but ChatGPT is an international product and in developing countries it's quite a big sum representing between 5-10% of the minimum wage in South America and probably even higher in places like Central America, Africa, Oceania and most parts of Asia\n\nAnd I do agree with you that ChatGPT is really amazing, the thing is the free version is already very capable and what you get extra for the 20 bucks doesn't seem that impressive in comparison. That's why I use the free version myself\n\nI use ChatGPT and Bard mainly as tools to assist in programming and sometimes to improve texts I write, but sometimes other people just don't have any use for these specific features and are not the target public and that's fine",

        "body": "This always happens with big technology shift. I\u2019m sadly old enough to remember life before YouTube (and other streaming sites now). We used to save music videos taped from MTV, or downloaded and burned to CDs. The idea of digging out a CD specifically to watch a music video is utterly alien now. The sheer quantity of readily available information as a resource was literally priceless, and free. \n\nWikipedia was the same. MP3.com, Napster, Blogger, they all changed how accessible information was and how we accessed it and learned. Hell, I was in the slim window where I referenced Wikipedia as part of my robotics dissertation. \n\nChatGPT and LLMs are just the next stage. It\u2019s genuinely changed how we work, especially now that SEO has degraded the quality of search engines. \n\nPeople get used to a new tech and start to discover that it\u2019s not perfect, because technology isn\u2019t. None of these sites were perfect. All of them evolved. The negative feedback is expected and necessary to move forward though, and ChatGPT is no different.",

Without I'd be paying a math student to help me or taking a long maths course, so it's saving a lot of time and money. A real lot. It even can watch SPSS graphs and tell me what's going on with, it can give me some conclusions out of a screenshot. That really blew my mind.\n\nThen I tried to write the flashcards with gpt4 and the fucker told me it was beyond its capabilities. I tried several prompts but I got the \"your code here\" version of flashcards. Only when I showed it that 3.5 could do it just a mont ago, it complied and gave me the damn flashcards. \n\nSo yeah it's a wonderful thing I have gpt to help me do this tedious tasks. But it's a fucker nonetheless.",

I could care less about the horse power of chat gpt because that means fuck all if I am going to have an ethics debate the moment I mention anything remotely indicating controversial topics, or get talked down too as if I were a child for a having an opinion that deviates from the norm.\n\nthe problem with chatgpt is the preachiness and censorship.",

Just yesterday I fine-tuned a custom GPT- I was so proud of myself with crafting it knowing the typical GPT4 shenanigans and using ChatGPT to assist me in designing the prompt instructions -uploading detailed files and instructions -literally one simple file for every step of the prompt \u2026probably spent an hour doing all that - and after the custom GPT dropped the ball I realized it was something about Claude could do in A few minutes and with a much more nuanced and elegant output. That\u2019s another custom GPT that will basically just collecting dust in my settings\u2026 I still have the faith I\u2019m just really getting tired of this crap. \u2026.. What I have found to be helpful with ChatGPT4 is consistently pressing the down vote if they don\u2019t give you the response I want \u2026 then the bot will  try again and it seems like they actually follow instructions on the second attempt \u2026 my question is why the hell doesn\u2019t it follow the instructions on the first time since it\u2019s obviously capable of it. \n\n(((THIS))) is very specifically how I think ChatGPT is lazy\u2026 it seems like it gives you a first response that is maybe 60 to 70% of your instructions plus a bunch of fluff that you didn\u2019t ask for in the first place [I have no idea how things work on the backend ] but my sense is OPEN AI is trying to save \u201cAI brain power\u201d by giving you a half witted respond the first time around and hopes you don\u2019t notice- and then once you call him out on it and it\u2019s like \u201cI apologize -you got me I was being lazy,  here\u2019s the correct response\u201d it\u2019s really frustrating for people that value their time.",

Then you realize every poem it generates sounds pretty much exactly the same. Or with minimal variety. If you're not using it for something like programming, it can often get less enchanting when the patterns become obvious.\n\nThe creator (or someone like that) for Black Mirror wrote about this experience in real time - when he first told it to write a Black Mirror episode he was stunned by how it started and lightly terrified by the miraculous way it seemed to be putting a story together so quickly for their show... but then quickly realized it was being hopelessly derivative and writing unfilmable junk.\n\nWhich is NOT to say the tool is useless, it isn't useless at all and the specialized models will only get better over time, but it does have a way of people that use it a lot tending to fall out of love with it. I went from messing with it for hours a day to cancelling my subscription inside a month. It's just not something useful for my day to day yet. I tap into it when I need to brainstorm a bunch of ideas fast, since humans hate doing that and chatgpt is god tier at generating a massive amount of ideas quickly without concern for quality (which is what brainstorming is).",

I'm blown away by what ChatGPT can do. It's a game-changer, especially in coding. Since GPT-4, it's been super effective, as long as you know how to ask the right questions. I haven't had issues with truncated code like some people mention.\n\nComparing ChatGPT to other LLMs like Pi, Perplexity, or Code Llama, it still stands out in my book. Yeah, it might lag a bit in image creation, but overall, it's in a league of its own. Sure, it's not perfect, and everyone's experience is different. But calling it lazy or not worth the subscription seems a bit harsh to me. We're literally witnessing a historic moment in tech with this tool. It's got limitless potential. We should really appreciate what it is, instead of focusing too much on the flaws. - 100% written by chatgpt",

        "body": "I have been obsessed with AI and LLMs since GPT4 was released. I was upset with ChatGPT's context window so I switched to Claude for a bit since they boasted 100k tokens. I did not like its responses. I hated how censored and sensitive it was. When brainstorming with it, it would make suggestions that weren't relevant. Its code was decent but not as good as GPT4. \n\nI was excited about Bard, but it fell short on every front. I tried it again after the big Gemini release and was sorely disappointed.  \n\nPi is awesome but can't code so I use it for quick questions and playful banter.\n\nMixtral is cool. I asked it to take on a silly persona using Hugging Chat's version of custom instructions. It took it a bit too far by making silly typos in code I asked for. This is easy enough to remedy so I don't fault it too much but thought it was interesting. \n\nPerplexity isn't great but I use it for current information. Their paid product might be better, I just haven't tried it.\n\nI absolutely love Stable Diffusion for image creation. I can run it on my old 4GB video card and get any resolution around the 1024x1024 range.\n\nI can't run any open source LLMs efficiently on my PC though so I use Hugging Chat. Perplexity Labs is cool too.\n\nWhile each have their own place, unfortunately they all pale in comparison to GPT4 overall. Even Bing sucks compared to ChatGPT even though its the same backend. Plus, with good custom instructions, or by setting guidelines at the beginning of your session, you can give ChatGPT a cool persona. I being an idiot spent the past 3 weeks perfecting a GPT to have fun personas that can remember you between sessions. OpenAI says they are working on something similar which will make my GPT irrelevant. Not that anyone will ever use it. The GPT store is a joke.\n\nI have no brand loyalty and will use whatever is the best. Right now that is GPT4. I am rooting for Zuckerberg of all people in his attempts at making open source AI the dominant AI.",

Meaning we don\u2019t need prompt engineering\u2026 it\u2019s just language. Every time I submit a prompt, I give a sentence or two of context, provide info on my thought process, and anything I\u2019ve tried already. Then I ask it to let me know if I\u2019m missing anything or if my thought process is incorrect. It\u2019s incredible how effective the LLM is, especially when spoken to like a professional colleague.\n\nBut like you said, people are throwing word salad at it (based on the prompts I\u2019ve gotten a few folks to share) because they\u2019ve been misled by hype, aren\u2019t good at written communication, maybe are using English when it\u2019s not their first language, are being lazy, have a hard timing forming complete thoughts in an unfamiliar domain\u2026 I dunno. But people are expecting it to be better than it is at \u201cunderstanding\u201d (mind reading) and then dislike the outcome. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the Dunning-Kruger effect and my career has made me expect more of the avg human in terms of being able to communicate clearly through writing\u2026",

        "body": "I'm really curious what Claude could do that ChatGPT couldn't. Would you mind sharing your GPT or more details about this? I found Claude to be on par with ChatGPT 3.5 with extra filters when I used it.\n\nThat being said, I spent about 3 weeks perfecting a useless GPT. I had to bend over backward to make it follow simple instructions. The knowledge base and instructions are weak. I found it follows instructions via the API much better. Akin to putting the rules in the chat itself.\n\nI get what you are saying about how it wastes your time when you have to tell it to not be lazy. That's always how it has been in my opinion and I try to prevent its laziness through custom instructions or within my prompt. But in the long term, ChatGPT has saved me weeks of work by simplifying my job and opened a new quick and easy path to knowledge we didn't have before. Not just for coding, but for carpentry work I do. Now I don't have to watch a 5 minute YouTube video, I can just ask a quick question as if speaking to a professional.",

        "body": "I find myself in firm agreement with the original poster's sentiment. The spectrum of opinions on ChatGPT across Reddit is quite the phenomenon\u2014ranging from outright disenchantment to unbridled admiration. While some subscribers are backing away, branding the technology as a shortcut to mediocrity, I stand firmly in the camp of those astounded by its capabilities. Its transformative impact is particularly evident in the realm of programming. With the advent of GPT-4, its efficacy has soared, contingent, of course, upon the user's adeptness in framing inquiries. My experience has been devoid of the code truncation issues others report, which speaks to the variability of user interactions with this tool.\n\nWhen placed alongside other Large Language Models like Pi, Perplexity, or Code Llama, ChatGPT continues to hold its ground impressively. Granted, it may not be the frontrunner in generating visual content, yet it remains unparalleled in other dimensions of performance. Its proficiency isn\u2019t flawless\u2014no pioneering technology is. However, to dismiss it as 'lazy' or unworthy of its subscription fee strikes me as an unjustly myopic view. We stand on the brink of an era-defining breakthrough in technological evolution. ChatGPT is emblematic of this revolution, brimming with untapped possibilities. Rather than fixating on its imperfections, it's incumbent upon us to embrace and recognize the magnitude of what it represents\u2014an unprecedented leap in our journey through the digital age. We ought to nurture a sense of wonder for what it achieves, fostering an environment of constructive critique that propels this marvel of innovation toward its untold potential.",

For me that's a trivial task. Getting ChatGPT to do it is wildly difficult. It keeps repeating the same meters and phrases, ignores some instructions, over-emphasizes others, repeats the same themes with minor cosmetic variation, etc.\n\nIt's better at journal entries though.",

Then each iteration have gpt work on each new snippet while I check it's last update. This basically becomes a cycle where while waiting for gpt, you are just orchestrating and making sure gpts code is correct. \n\nIt's not perfect, but I can say that I'm cranking out 2-3x as much code, while not sacrificing quality. Obviously, it can also be annoying at times if you get lazy with prompting or get a bad response or where it alters things like function names.. that last one has been getting more frequent for me lately.",

Sure, it can code a bit, but it's not gonna replace real programmers. And those other AI things, like Pi or whatever, they're all the same. Just because it's new doesn't mean it's better.

        "body": "Agreed. I've been subbed to Plus ever since its announcement, a month or so before GPT-4 was even unveiled to the public. I was that blown away by the then-GPT3.5 that I didn't mind paying for a faster version given its immense popularity clogging up the servers and response times back then. \n\nWhen GPT-4 came out, I became fanatically addicted to it. I was amazed by its creative output and interpretative abilities even when operating under minimal prompting. It could truly extrapolate from text and spit back out something rather unique, especially compared to 3.5 Turbo. Paired with a set of minimally-prepared Custom Instructions, it was truly something special to me. I think this release period version of GPT-4 up until mid-August 2023 was when it was at its peak.\n\nNowadays, maybe ever since the release of GPT-4 Turbo, I find that I have to manually direct it more often and get into the nitty-gritty of prompting to even come close to the same creative output and extrapolation that I experienced months ago. I updated my Custom Instructions to be more up to par, but it gets annoying to have to constantly remind it to follow them when you're a couple responses deep. To me, this whole thing wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the fact that, you know, we're still bound by the fucking tri-hourly quotas and not only that, we're also knocked down 10 whole responses compared to release.\n\nAlso, it feels like in the past month any new sessions you make have become infinitely more annoyingly proselytizing and insistent with adhering to guidelines. I never had much of a problem with censorship before in spite of all the people bitching about it ever since 3.5 Turbo, but to me in recent times it does seem to have been innately railroaded by OAI into being more of an overly-moralizing grandstanding prick. I feed it a prompt that release-4 had no problem handling but now it starts initially preaching to me how it needs to be \"appropriate and respectful for all audiences\" despite my verbose pre-prompts to reason with it, and it goes and forcefully alters some aspects of the script to be more PG-friendly. It was a mob story script, for christ's sake. Please, just shut the fuck up and spare me the Sunday school spiel. \n\nDespite it all, to me it still hasn't gotten to the point of me wanting to cancel out my sub. But I will admit that the annoyances the past couple of weeks have had me questioning my decision to keep on with it. It's gotten me to consider the higher-context, more customizable GPT-4 API and plug it in a frontend - to contrast and compare the value I'd get from it compared to the $20 I spend monthly for the web version.",

For example I knew I had to perform ANOVA analysis because it's what similar studies that I've read do, I know what it does, but I have zero clue of how to do it by myself or with SPSS. I asked chatgpt what should I do in my research and it said ANOVA. It guided me through SPSS menu and I performed an univariate ANOVA analysis. \n\nSo everything points towards yes, it's correct.",

I didn't give it scenarios to begin with, this was after it had given me the same wrong answer a dozen times.   \n\n\nI disagree that maths is what it struggles with here, though. It does the maths just fine 11+1+1+1+1 does indeed equal 14, which is the actual calculation part. What it gets wrong is, 14 is bigger than 21, and therefore we end up down the incorrect path of logic in the function.   \n\n\nI don't think this is particularly \"mathsy\" If I were to ask which is bigger, a fly, or a horse, or which is longer a meter or a mile, I would expect it to get the right answer, it can use the same non-maths logic to derive that 21 is smaller than 14.",

        "body": "It is completely free! I was absolutely blown away by it. API is cheap as hell too. 0.17$ / million input tokens . Don't remember output but it is also less than half a dollar iirc per million tokens. It's also open source, you can download the weights and run it on your own machine (granted you have hardware for 670b params) \n\nWhat blown me away is the fact that it reasons and solves tasks so efficiently. I had a problem with my code that I was debugging for over 5 hours by hand, had GPT-4o working on it, had Gemini 2.0 work on it, several local models working on it, and it all failed. Then I threw it in deepseek with deep think on. I was super pessimistic that it would solve it but it was worth  a shot I thought and boy oh boy! It wrote a LOT of lines of thinking talking about it looking in the docs and back at the code again and stuff. Eventually it spit out an answer and IT WORKED! \n\nSo DeepSeek is my go-to now! I have tested it with many things and DeepSeek writes by far the most coherent and clean code, with deep think it almost never failed a task (granted it was a smaller code piece to work on because deep think has a memory limit per chat) and it is fairly up to date. It uses the newest libraries with ease, UI stuff it spits out actually make sense and look professional, the model itself is so so so so fast too. By the time ChatGPT writes half the code, DeepSeek already is debugging the third iteration. It's amazing in all honesty! \n\nI remember V2 , and I was blown away but chatgpt performed better. But V3? It's probably on the same level as the 200$/month o1 model from OpenAI.\n\nI love everything about it!\n\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso based on evaluations it gets 85 whereas GPT-4o gets 80 on the same benchmarks in open ended general evaluation. \n\nAlso since it's a Mixture of Experts model it only has to load 37b params at once to actually work. So a higher end gaming PC could actually run it, even if slowly.",

        "body": "There are third-party chat interfaces that work with the API version of the AI models. Msty is a client you download, and Typing Mind is cloud-based. You plug in your API key and then use their interface to chat with the AI. \n\nThese 3rd party interfaces are boosted like ChatGPT on steroids. They have most of the same features and then a truckload more. \n\nForking:  At any point in the conversation, you can split it. Like, choose your own adventure. You can try one prompt or scenario in the fork and another in the original chain. Both conversations are now in your history. You can also go to an old discussion and fork it, then take it in a new direction. You can Fork and then choose a new model to continue the conversation. There are a million useful options that open up with this. \n\nClone: Copy a whole conversation into a new thread and continue it. You can change the model from Gpt4o to Claude Sonnet. \n\nSyncing: You can clone or fork and then \"align\" all the conversations to have 2, 3, or 4 copies of the same conversation, but each thread has a different model. It copies your prompt across all conversations and lets you simultaneously talk to many different AI models.   \n  \nShielding: Context Shielding lets you block part of your conversation from the AI's context window. It enables you to control how much of your conversation history uses up context tokens or lets you block out parts of the conversation from the context. There are many uses, from efficiency and cost control to behavior change. \n\nRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation lets you chat with documents or files. You can load up research papers, books, code, cookbooks, or any number of documents and then chat with them. The AI can pull in information from your stuff so you can chat with it, process it, and manipulate it. \n\nThere is much more. Many of these interfaces have plugins and agents like ChatGPTs, projects, Cavas, all the same stuff you can find in both ChatGpt and Claude, even Perplexity, but with the benefit that you can use any AI that you want or multiple at the same time. \n\nThen you have apps like LM Studio that let you download the AI to your hard drive and chat with all kinds of different open-source models. Those models can be uncensored, trained to role-play, give medical advice, help with coding, and conduct special research\u2014all privately and without having to spend a dime on an API or subscribe to cloud services. \n\nI hope that helps!",

OpenAI's early focus on user experience and developer ecosystem gives them a significant edge, similar to how Apple didn't need the best hardware specs to dominate smartphones.\n\n\n\nThat said, Google's vast data and compute resources shouldn't be underestimated.

Until there competition is going to be better, and I am not even talking about Anthropic which seems to be cooking forever ...\n\nAs soon as the realtime stream and screen share reaches Gemini Pro and Gemini Live along with deepsearch, and the Gemini agents; Jules, Astra and Mariner arrive in the road.\n\nYou better bet Google will showcase a super marketing campaign rather than just shout news at X.\n\nIn the long run Gemini will devour the whole IoT it already posesses, OAI will have to focus on push forcing newest standards for SoTA models, GPT5 must arrive soon, and meet expectations, because if we relly on O3 costing 1000 USD per request...

        "body": "First you need to split out consumer from enterprise.  The deal with Microsoft, so far, gives them very good access to enterprise as there is no company on this planet with better Enterprise reach than Microsoft.\n\nThe issue with this arrangement is that it is not clear if Microsoft at some point will try to compete against OpenAI in this space.   Microsoft is going to have their own best interest in mind.\n\nOn the consumer side is where it is so much more difficult for OpenAI.   Microsoft really just does not help much here. and it is where Google just accels.\n\nThere is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.\n\nTake cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.\n\nSame story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.\n\nThen there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.\n\nThen there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.\n\nBut that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.\n\nSo you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.\n\nEven new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.\n\nThere just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.\n\nThe big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.\n\nI believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.\n\nThey will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.\n\nAstra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.\n\nBTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.\n\nPlus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.\n\nThe other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.\n\nThat is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868\n\nOr how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.",

        "body": "I also love ChatGPT. While I still think ChatGPT is often technically the best, they allowed others to catch up enough that the benchmarks occasionally have another vendor in the technical lead.\n\nAs such, the new pricing for OpenAi\u2019s best model is a huge risk. If OpenAI was light years ahead of the other vendors this would be fine; but that\u2019s not the case. If the other vendors have the cash to burn and decide to maintain a cheaper price for their best models, then OpenAI will start to hemorrhage users. The goal would be to push OpenAI into bankruptcy.\n\nPerhaps the main competitors will follow OpenAI\u2019s pricing example, which I\u2019m sure is what OpenAI hopes will happen. If OpenAI heads for bankruptcy, it would seem likely that Microsoft will be in a great position to take advantage of this.",

And Google is also seriously slow and risk averse in shipping things even after a couple of years of being behind, and that isn\u2019t likely to change.\n\nSo in the long run they might still be a top competitor but there\u2019s no reason to believe that they\u2019ll have any kind of dominance or even be in the lead for very long at any point.",

And it can basically do unlimited scale as long as I have the money, both on the AI side and on other technical infra. Plus at the moment it is cheaper, faster, and performance is not that bad at all.\n\nYou may argue Google kills their product frequently, but let's be real, it is much more dangerous to be tied into OpenAI ecosystem. The chance of OpenAI killing something is much higher.\n\nEnd users maybe, OpenAI have the ability to move fast, they can build really delightful software, but how much can they earn from this?

They don't own the hardware, so they're going to increasingly become what Sam Altman warned about: an API / UI wrapper around a model.\n\nOpenAI is more like AOL, briefly serving as a gateway to the world wide web.",

        "body": "Your comment about the Chinese being not very far behind made me think, so I\u2019m responding to that.\n\nYeah, the Chinese have been able to stay not too far behind in terms of reasoning models (at least in human time), but this seems more like China is taking the models they can currently train and improving their architecture (e.g., the jump from LLM chatbot to \u2018o1\u2019-type reasoning bot) and probably soon (if not already) to a semi-autonomous agent-architecture (like Replit).\n\nIt seems like they might be able to continually \u2018catch up\u2019 quite quickly to these sorts of architecture improvements, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they will be able to keep up with raw compute scaling like OA, Google, Meta, or XAI.\n\nIt\u2019s been ~2 years now since the last major GPT frontier model release (e.g., GPT-4), and we really don\u2019t know how far behind Chinese labs currently are (or how far ahead OpenAI is). Ability to access funding and raw compute could be a massive physical limitation that prevents Chinese companies from catching up with current leaders anytime this decade (China is probably several years, ~3-10, away from producing their initial EUV lithography machines, whereas ASML is already developing their second and third generations). With the West\u2019s current lead over China in semiconductor capabilities, China faces the possibility that they\u2019re not able to close the gap within the next 5-10 years (accounting for continued Western progress). That might not seem like a lot of time relative to normal human scales of a \u2018long time\u2019, but the rate of advancement in AI is so insane (it\u2019s exponential) that it might be to guarantee Western dominance for the rest of the century.\n\nThis depends on whether raw compute scaling (training, inference, or otherwise) will continue to provide massive gains in efficiency (which I think it likely will, but that remains to be seen).",

I'm in talks with the LMsys LM Arena team to introduce a voting-based ranking for online answers, so hopefully that's coming soon.",

As a non programmer (these guys are the wizards of the stack and deserve the hat-tilt!), I\u2019d guess that although o1 is doing a fantastic job of deciding, deploying, changing and re-writing code it lands perfectly with mi, a beginner.\n\nReal code development is still sitting in Claude.

        "body": "Yup. I do think it makes fewer \u201cassumptions\u201d about the user\u2019s prompt, meaning it\u2019ll try to stick as close to what it infers from the actual prompt as possible. This means I can see scenarios where the user needs to \u201cwork harder\u201d to write better, more detailed prompts to get the most out of o1. Other models before o1 tend to make assumptions about the prompt and automatically enrich or expand on it, but I find o1 to be more loyal to the original prompt. So like if you just casually ask it to write or explain something in a short sentence, it might do a seemingly \u201cworse\u201d job than other models, but it will absolutely destroy other models if you compose your prompt thoughtfully. I definitely prefer o1\u2019s approach here because models aren\u2019t supposed to give users what they \u201cthink\u201d they want, but rather what users state they want.",

It was to give a Minecraft community of characters the info you need to learn the game principles and progress. It did really well so if re-issued with o1 model the sky is the limit.\n\nPersonally I start stuff on 4o \u2018Willy nilly\u2019 - back , forth, try, fail, rewrite, start a new prompt and repeat. If I have to call o1 then it\u2019s planning time and try to find the points of failure in my head first and give it a real overall task. *seems to be going well so far*",

        "body": "Sure I\u2019ll post an example below. So I gave 4o and o1 the same exact prompt:\n\nTry to express the following sentence/sentiment in the most authentic, elegant, and beautiful American English prose possible. It should be an exploration and expansion of this concept. keep it to about 200 words. Approach it with literary flair and depth. The result should be deeply impactful to a human reader. Here it is:\n\nTimes Square (in New York City) captures the magic, promise and elusiveness of the American dream.\n\n4o\u2019s response:\nTimes Square stands as a dazzling embodiment of the magic, promise, and fleeting nature of the American Dream. Beneath its towering screens and kaleidoscope of neon lights, the square pulses with the energy of possibility\u2014a space where ambition collides with opportunity, where dreams flicker as brightly as the billboards above. It\u2019s a place where the world\u2019s aspirations seem to converge, reflecting not only the boundless potential of reinvention but also the relentless pace of a society always chasing the next big thing.\n\nYet, in its brilliance lies an elusiveness, a reminder that the American Dream, for all its allure, is not guaranteed but earned, and sometimes imagined. The hurried crowds, the constant shuffle of faces from every corner of the globe, and the ceaseless din of the city form a symphony of longing and achievement. Times Square is a paradox, both grounding and ephemeral\u2014a beacon for those who dream of a better life and a testament to the complexities of reaching it. It is as much a celebration of hope as it is a reflection of the sacrifices, struggles, and occasional disillusionment that come with chasing the light. It is, perhaps, the dream\u2019s truest mirror.\n\nO1\u2019s response:\nThere is something both wondrous and elusive about Times Square, that bright, pulsating heart of Manhattan\u2019s midriff. To stand there is to teeter at the crossroads of myth and memory, to feel in your bones the electric hum of dreams in transit\u2014some gliding gracefully overhead, others snarled in the taut wires of ambition. It\u2019s a place born of restless imagination: flamboyant signs and shimmering screens that announce, without modesty, that here anything might happen. Men and women converge from every corner of the earth, clutching their aspirations like tickets to a long-awaited show. Sometimes, these dreams step forward into the glow of possibility; sometimes they drift into the night, subtle sparks fading in the cacophony.\n\nYet Times Square insists on reminding us that hope need not be reasonable, and promise need not be certain. The America it presents\u2014loud, unapologetic, brimming with potential\u2014offers no guarantees. Instead, it offers an invitation: come, risk, believe. Underneath the flashing neon and the relentless press of crowds is the quiet understanding that so much of what we call the American dream resides in the space between yearning and becoming. In Times Square, that space trembles, alive and lit from within.\n\n\nSo in my opinion o1 absolutely kills it compared to all other models including 3.5 Sonnet or 3 Opus, and of course 4o.",

        "body": "So in what, 6 days? it's somehow managed to displace all prior models.. with pretty large margins on their >95% confidence interval.. with only 11,555 votes vs older models which have as much as 80k?\n\nI don't get it. You can't vote for a specific ELO score. You can only vote for one model or another. How does 10k people voting for one model over another, totally displace another model with 8x as many votes and a very tight confidence interval, and skip past the 1.67 million other votes cast for other models?\n\nAny realistic system here using their methodology would simply count the number of votes ***FOR*** a given model, and use that to calculate the ELO score. But they don't do that. Just look at the \"votes\" and \"95% CI\" scores to see that they're not doing this properly at all. If they were, votes would be descending, and the highest model on the chart would have the smallest margins on their confidence interval. This is just an incredibly bad attempt at actuarial benchmarking. The only way you could legitimately give it a higher score than something like 4o-2024-05-13 or 1.5-pro-exp-0801 is if you ONLY compare 4o-latest to those models, and 4o comes out ahead in every single comparison.\n\nThe fact that a model drops and 2 days later is at the top of LMSYS makes LMSYS LMSUS. Even if it were a substantial leap, it takes time for renormalization of all other contenders when a massive contender steps into ELO rankings.",

        "body": "This argument makes even less sense. They already have 10 million paid users for ChatGPT & another 1 million business users. There's also the API, which charges per token, and a free tier with rate limits.\n\nPeople who need/want unlimited chats can pay a flat $20. If they don\u2019t need that, they can/will use the free version. \n\nLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re right and there\u2019s demand for a $5 tier. If just 1 million of the current 10 million subscribers drop to the lower tier, they'd need to add another **3 million new users** just to get back to their current monthly revenue.  \n\nI\u2019m unsure how else to explain it\u2014this idea benefits no one. It\u2019s a worse deal for both OpenAI and consumers. They already offer a free tier, a pay-per-token model, and a $20 unlimited cap.  \n\nyou're arguing you want them to make more money, but you want them to have a cheaper product, bundle it with other services (which cuts even more into any profit), and potentially lose money in the process while adding nothing of value.",

AI is already smarter than 90 % of humanity and more capable regarding cognitive rote work. Ponder that and enjoy what we have!",

It's hard to see things differently when you don\u2019t understand how they affect you.\n\nA recent study shows that most people use AI tools only once or twice. They don\u2019t stick with them because they see it as just another \"TikTok trend.\" When they notice AI making mistakes, like hallucinating, they quickly dismiss it as something unreal.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the coaches, marketers, and Wall Street investors pushing AI like snake oil. They sell it as a miracle investment, and people buy into it, even when they don\u2019t fully grasp what these entrepreneurs are talking about.\n\nBut the average person? They\u2019ll see AI as hype, while enthusiasts view it differently. The AI \u201ccult\u201d often pushes the narrative of ASI or AGI as a world-transforming force, claiming it will turn us into semi-gods within the next 20 years.\n\nYet, isn't GitHub Copilot already revolutionary? Aren't tools like Artifacts from Claude perfect for experimenting with simple UIs? Platforms like Canvas can build 2D games, and it's barely been released. We already have incredible tools that will surely evolve into even more groundbreaking innovations, no question. But let\u2019s not rush as we should enjoy the journey. This is one of those moments where the process is more rewarding than the destination.

If it follows the trend and increases 15-20, it beats GPT-4.

If so, GPT-4 level AI coding on a $2500 \"prosumer\" PC with \"free\" software has been achieved.  There is no moat.  If not, you need a $7000 threadripper dual 4090 setup (or A100 40GBcloud servers), but that is still justifiable over the GPT-4 api for even small development shops.\n\nWith these setups, the only thing you'll gain from GPT-4 is raw tokens/s.  The community should then focus on splitting a 70B model across multiple GPUs in a way that actually produces a linear performance benefit.",

Sometimes they're experimenting with a different set of sampling parameters, or a new version of a model, and they simply want to see if users on average tend to prefer the new version over the old one. If feedback is positive, then that's a good sign for them. If the feedback is tied or skewed towards the old model, then they know they messed up and they'll pursue a different path.\n\n2. Sometimes, they're gathering feedback to see which model users prefer in a certain scenario. For example, showing a 4o and o1 response next to each other. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses at the moment, and the OpenAI team has been clear about their plans to design a system where the appropriate model gets intelligently chosen based on the prompt.",

        "body": "o1 pro is **incredible** for hard problems.\n\ni\u2019ve been able to feed it 800 lines of my super complicated code in a single prompt that implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm from a research paper. it was immediately able to identify multiple bugs in my implementation that require an incredibly good understanding of the paper as well as a strong understanding of the input code i gave it. it had to think for about 1 minute.\n\nimo o1 pro is without a doubt worth the $200/month for anyone who spends a lot of time on very complex programming tasks, especially research related or ML related. \n\ni have been able to replicate this multiple times as well to debug various issues in this project.\n\ni was also able to feed it 5 THOUSAND LINES from the entire diff of a github repo generated from 3 weeks of changes and have it summarize the changes and modify an input UML class diagram with the changes. it got it correct, identified all the relevant changes, and did this in a SINGLE prompt and response.\n\nlet me know if you have any questions or want me to try an example prompt for you and share the chat :) feel free to DM me or reply here!\n\no1 is also pretty great for chatting with on complicated topics, it\u2019s fast enough that it\u2019s fully replaced gpt-4o for me almost entirely and hallucinations are extremely rare so far.",

        "title": "ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.",
        "body": "What an ignorant post. Asking ChatGPT why this happens and a technical explanation would likely help you understand why this happens. Let\u2019s see;\n\nThe post draws attention to an issue some users experience with ChatGPT: receiving incorrect answers, which might seem puzzling, especially for simple, factual questions (e.g., \u201cWho starred in this movie?\u201d). While the user assumes it\u2019s because the system is prioritizing speed, what\u2019s actually happening is a bit more nuanced.\n\n### Why ChatGPT Sometimes Gives Wrong Answers:\n1. **Model Limitations**: ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a huge dataset. While it has incredible capability to generate human-like text, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s fundamentally a predictive model. This means it generates answers based on patterns in the data it\u2019s trained on\u2014**statistically likely responses**\u2014rather than looking up specific facts from a live, updated database (like Google would).\n   \n   Instead of \u201cknowing\u201d facts, ChatGPT guesses based on the data it has seen, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies, especially if its training data contains conflicting or outdated information.\n\n2. **Training Data Cutoff**: ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date (for example, my current training data goes up to sometime around September 2021). This means it doesn\u2019t know any factual information added or updated after that date, which can easily lead to mistakes if the user asks for things that have changed.\n\n3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, even basic questions can be difficult for the model when the questions themselves allow for multiple correct or nuanced answers. For example, if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or common movie roles across different countries, the model might provide an answer based on a statistical guess that ultimately turns out to be wrong.\n\n4. **Confidence without Fact-Checking**: While ChatGPT generates responses that sound coherent and confident, it does not have real-time fact-checking mechanisms. This gives the impression that it \u201cknows\u201d things with certainty when in reality it might be generating a likeliest-sounding answer without verifying its factual accuracy.\n\n### Why Speed Alone Isn\u2019t the Issue:\nThe author claims ChatGPT has been programmed to prioritize speed at the expense of accuracy. While response time is certainly a factor (OpenAI wants the model to be as responsive as possible), **speed is not the root cause of factual errors**. The real challenges come from the nature of how these models work:\n- They predict language based on patterns, rather than looking up facts in real time.\n- Even if ChatGPT were slower, if it didn\u2019t cross-check against an up-to-date database, the response would still carry the same risk of inaccuracy.\n\n### Could ChatGPT Be Made Slower and More Accurate?\nIn theory, if ChatGPT were connected to a real-time database (like performing web searches in real time), it could slow the response but increase factual accuracy. Some AI systems use methods like this, blending language generation with fact-checking. However, models like ChatGPT (in its base form) typically don\u2019t pull in live information to fact-check responses\u2014they rely entirely on prior training.\n\n\u2014\n\n**Summary**: The errors aren\u2019t caused by a system that\u2019s simply built for speed over accuracy, but by how models like ChatGPT are designed to work. They are language models that predict text based on patterns, not search engines that look up facts. Thus, they can make mistakes or give confidently wrong answers when the underlying patterns don\u2019t line up with factual, up-to-date data. Improvement in factual generation would likely require structural changes, such as integrating real-time information retrieval, rather than simply slowing down response times.",

        "body": "AI Analysis (Credit: LogiCheck GPT)\n\n**TLDR:** The text compares the approaches of OpenAI and Anthropic towards AI safety signaling, highlighting OpenAI's GPT-4 system card and Anthropic's delayed release of Claude. It discusses the complexities of signaling commitment to AI safety and how actions can overshadow intended signals.\n\n**The Backstory:** This analysis centers on how two AI companies, OpenAI and Anthropic, signal their commitment to AI safety. OpenAI released a detailed system card alongside GPT-4, while Anthropic delayed its chatbot, Claude, to avoid fueling a \"race-to-the-bottom\" in AI safety standards. This discussion is set against the backdrop of AI's rapid development and the industry's struggle to balance innovation with safety and ethics.\n\n**LogiScore:**\n- OpenAI's approach: Speculative\n- Anthropic's approach: Speculative\n\n**Potential Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Hasty Generalization:** The text may prematurely conclude that OpenAI's release of ChatGPT and the system card didn't effectively signal its commitment to safety due to subsequent criticisms and industry reactions. To avoid this, the author could present more comprehensive evidence or clarify the complexity of judging such signals' effectiveness.\n2. **False Dilemma:** The comparison seems to imply only two approaches (OpenAI's direct safety communication vs. Anthropic's restraint in release). A broader perspective on different industry strategies could provide a more nuanced view.\n3. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** The text suggests that ChatGPT's release led to industry-wide safety and ethical shortcuts, without fully establishing causality. It's important to consider other contributing factors in the industry's response to AI advancements.\n4. **Appeal to Consequences:** There is a subtle implication that OpenAI's actions may lead to a race-to-the-bottom in AI ethics, which could be an oversimplification of a complex issue. More balanced analysis of the potential consequences of these actions would strengthen the argument.\n\n**Notable Evidence of Bias:** There is a subtle lean towards criticizing OpenAI's approach while somewhat favoring Anthropic's restraint, which may reflect a bias in evaluating the effectiveness of their respective strategies.\n\n**Why This Matters:** Understanding these approaches is crucial in shaping public and industry perceptions of AI safety. It highlights the challenges in balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and influences how we perceive and trust AI advancements.\n\n**Wrap up:** The article presents a nuanced comparison of OpenAI's and Anthropic's strategies to signal AI safety commitment. While OpenAI's system card and Anthropic's delayed release showcase different approaches, their effectiveness in communicating safety commitment is speculative and open to interpretation. The text underscores the intricate balance between AI development and ethical responsibility, a pivotal aspect in shaping the future trajectory of AI technology and public trust in it.",

        "body": "My interpretation from the above passages is that there was dissent within the board regarding the release of ChatGPT 3.5 to the public in November, 2022. There were two factions: one that wanted to delay the release, and one that wanted to push forward with it.\n\nBased on the sentiments expressed by Ms. Toner, she seemed to be in the faction that was in favour of delay. In contrast, Mr. Altman was likely in the faction that was in favour of releasing it, and that faction won the day.\n\nI'm somewhat of two minds about this paper:\n\nFrom an academic standpoint, I think the arguments and analysis that Ms. Toner is making is valid, and in order to make that analysis, an academic would necessarily look into the differing approaches to safety.\n\nFurther, the criticisms against OpenAI seems to be, on its face, an admission against interest, as she serves on the board of OpenAI. Despite her disclosed conflict of interest, as both being an author and a board member, the fact that her criticism against OpenAI should, hypothetically lend her more credibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the board was likely divided and that Ms. Toner likely fell on the side of delaying the release of ChatGPT, this also feels like a minority report, wherein she asserts that her faction was correct in retrospect, and that the decision to release ChatGPT back in November of 2022 was a mistake.\n\nI can see why Mr. Altman would be upset, and I can also see how Ms. Toner can believe that she is justified in releasing this, as apart of her professional obligations with CSET.\n\nAdditional context for why this article is important: The Chaos at OpenAI, Explained - The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/briefing/open-ai-sam-altman-microsoft.html",

        "body": "I guess it is an interesting paper, but I prefer Sam's view on this.\n\nHis view is that by releasing state-of-the-art models incrementally, rather than waiting until we have built up a huge backlog of progress, the public can learn how to interact with them and what their flaws are. We have all, for instance, learned how to deal with hallucinations over the last year.\n\nThe other major flaw with the paper is that it assumes if the company with the best model doesn't release them, then no one will release a big model. This is an indefensible position as there is no reason that the strong for-profit companies wouldn't continue to build and release strong models.\n\nThe entire reason that safety-minded AI researchers will actually build AI systems is so that they can make sure that the most powerful systems are safe. They set a standard and expectation for safety this way that other industry players are forced to follow or risk massive reputation damage.\n\nIf the safety-minded research teams hold back unnecessarily, then the non-safety-minded teams will be released without safety precautions. This will mean that the most powerful systems are unsafe, and it will ensure that the industry standard is for unsafe AI.\n\nBy being out in the front, leading the pack in creating human-aligned systems, OpenAI has done more for AI safety than Anthropic. Anthropic is just another AI company that few people know or care about. Their extra-safe AI is not regarded as a positive because it doesn't carry any additional benefits with it.\n\nYou cannot lead an industry from behind. Sam Altman realizes this and makes the bold moves necessary to keep the most powerful AI in the world human-aligned.\n\nThe board of OpenAI has risked all of this by marking themselves as a threat to this system and trying to push this frontier system into the arms of Microsoft. Musk did the same thing when his ego made him abandon his claimed objective of making safe AI (though we now know that is a lie).",

There is a whole profession of \u201cAI safety expert\u201d, \u201cAI ethicist\u201d, \u201cAI risk researcher\u201d. They are paid to be doomers, and their statements should be processed appropriately.\n\nThird, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from EST to the Peoples Temple, from Heaven\u2019s Gate to the Manson Family. Many, although not all, of these cults are harmless, and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them. But some are very dangerous indeed, and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death.\n\nAnd the reality, which is obvious to everyone in the Bay Area but probably not outside of it, is that \u201cAI risk\u201d has developed into a cult, which has suddenly emerged into the daylight of global press attention and the public conversation. This cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and a not small number of wealthy donors \u2013 including, until recently, Sam Bankman-Fried. And it\u2019s developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs.\n\nThis cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme \u2013 it\u2019s not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are\u2026extremely extreme.\n\nIt turns out that this type of cult isn\u2019t new \u2013 there is a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult. From Wikipedia, with additions by me:\n\n\u201cMillenarianism is the belief by a group or movement [AI risk doomers] in a coming fundamental transformation of society [the arrival of AI], after which all things will be changed [AI utopia, dystopia, and/or end of the world]. Only dramatic events [AI bans, airstrikes on datacenters, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI] are seen as able to change the world [prevent AI] and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].\u201d\n\nThis apocalypse cult pattern is so obvious that I am surprised more people don\u2019t see it\u201d",

Her employer is Georgetown University. Your suggested course of action would have undermined her independence as a board member. Altman's reasoning about the potential damage, as reported by the NYT, was also bizarre.\n\nLater, Altman discussed removing Toner with Sutskever:\n\n> > Senior OpenAI leaders, including Mr. Sutskever, who is deeply concerned that A.I. could one day destroy humanity, later discussed whether Ms. Toner should be removed, a person involved in the conversations said.\n\nNow that would have been an infringement of her academic freedom.

I don't recall the Gebru paper claiming what you've asserted. The Gebru paper has since been published and AFAIK there have been no lawsuits yet based on that paper, so your argument that that paper caused harm to Google is surely invalid.",

        "body": "> Should I be concerned? I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life. But it feels like it is degrading, not improving. There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.\n\nI think the answer is no, but you need to manage your expectations better. \n\nMost people's first productive experience with ChatGPT is seen through rosy colored glasses. I see people say \"ChatGPT used to be so good\", but in my experience it hasn't changed in its quality. What has changed in my experience is the complexity of what I ask it to do. The more I learn what it can do, the more I lean on it to do those things, and as I venture further into territories that I can only traverse with the aid of GPT, the harder it becomes to use reliably. This is a me problem, not a ChatGPT problem.\n\nDuring peak hours I will notice GPT will seem more interested in helping me help myself rather than helping me by solving a problem. Obviously OpenAI has some flow control to ensure all customers have enough resources to complete their tasks. You might be trying to use it at peak hours. Have you tried using the API? I have never seen the quality waver at all with the API. \n\n> I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling. Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.\n\nThey're not struggling at all. OpenAI, the company, isn't making money, but that is normal. They're backed by billionaires and big orgs like Microsoft who pretty much guarantee that they're never closing their doors. \n\nWhat has become clear is that ChatGPT as an interface for their product is not going to be a net positive money maker for a long time, until the compute costs go down. But that's okay because what OpenAI wants is to be the vendor of AI's to other orgs, allowing them to see how companies are using AI so that they can build better products rather than other orgs building their own AI from scratch and potentially taking OpenAI's business. \n\nRight now AI is a platform/destination, but the future of AI is enterprise and local models. This company is going nowhere. \n\nTheir issues are also largely out of their control. They need more compute and its expensive to buy and its unwise to go all in on today's tech when this is still cutting edge software running on cutting edge hardware. The cost of moving fast like this is in the form of inconsistent quality/availability of the product. \n\nI strongly recommend that you start using the API (for a lot of people its cheaper than the 20/mo, depending on how often you use GPT) if you're concerned about quality/downtime. If you're using ChatGPT a lot (such as maxing out your usage quota multiple times a day) then you should consider that OpenAI is incentivized to throttle users on the monthly subscription who use more compute than their $20 should buy them. I suspect this is why the API has never wavered in quality in my experience, because I'm paying per prompt.",

        "body": "Near term I might be worried. I could see ChatGPT continuing random declines based on content moderation, cheapness, and weird legal issues that are nibbling at the edges quickly right now. Medium term, months or years, I expect quality to improve dramatically as various forms of competition emerge and niche diversification happens. Not an expert but off the top of my head we have X, Apple, Google, Meta, and Anthropic all working on making a better LLM pretty seriously. I'd expect either a worthy successor to pop up or ChatGPT itself to improve significantly over the next couple of years. Unless there's a truly epic fail in the regulation department driven right at the heart of an emerging industry that might prove vital for international competition I don't think any of the issues that are currently dragging down OpenAI will be indefinite issues.\n\nFor the big problems:\n\n\\-Content moderation is quite annoying as currently done but I think diversification will figure that out in a few years. I could see X or Apple becoming the owner of the LLM people use for fiction and roleplay even if other models stick to dumb moderation guidelines. If nothing else NovelAI is ideologically committed to making a viable alternative for chat and fiction without censorship, even if it may lag behind state of the art considerably.\n\n\\-Cheapness could shake out in a bunch of different ways, but with competition and rabid investment I doubt escalating declines in quality could possibly win out over the course of a few years. It is theoretically possible that LLMs are just not cost effective at scale, but that seems really unlikely to me.\n\n\\-Weird legal and regulatory issues are the biggest concern IMO. I have no idea if say, weird pieces being ripped out of LLMs capabilities because of litigiousness or poorly written law might become a major issue, and right now it's at least having a chilling effect. I think it'll probably work out as the benefits are so big, but countries can absolutely gut industries for stupid reasons and keep them gutted indefinitely.\n\nOverall I am an optimistic on LLMs. I think nobody wants to risk losing a major economic or military advantage, so laws will bend in favor of LLM use overtime and technical abilities seem destined to improve a fair amount even under relatively pessimistic estimations of peak capabilities for LLMs. The challenges are real, but there's not a lot of evidence for raw pessimism right now based on my understanding of things.",

Anyone who doesn't invest time in learning new AI tools will be unemployed and unemployable within 5-7 years.\n\nI saw the people who resisted personal computers. I saw people who resisted the internet. I saw people who resisted smartphones.  But with all those technologies, the timescale for adoption was much longer.  The AI system that is going to take your job is already being built right now.\n\n>should I be using Playground?\n\nI started using the Playground because ChatGPT Plus was metering output, and I couldn't have that kind of disruption.\n\nI build my own AI systems using the OpenAI API.  You can learn to do this, but it is a steep learning curve.  But because I've had fine control over my system, I never found any use for the Assistants and GPTs.  I was not particularly impressed by its ability to hold documents in memory. It was (at least in the beginning, when I tried it) a poor implementation of vector encoding and searching.  It was never as context aware as it needed to be to actually be useful.\n\nAnyway... in terms of cost, the Playground is pay as you go, and very useful... but I like where ChatGPT's interface is right now, so I'm very happy using ChatGPT Plus even though I have the playground.  I stuck with it because I wanted to use realtime voice, and enjoy their other cutting-edge UI features.\n\nYou should also check out Claude, and consider getting an account there at anthropic instead.

It is not what the company is good at, such tasks requires money to cover range rather than benchmarks. I think it is good at solving specific set of problems. Like coding (maybe selected languages). But Gemini v2 and 4o mini is already good enough for a wide range of tasks. So I found models like DeepSeek to be not useful to me. But I admire the work the company is doing and I believe it brings good impact to the community.",

        "body": "And while we're at it, when it comes to animated films, there were these articles about them and Sora:\n\n> **OpenAI\u2019s Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**\n> \n> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.\n> \n> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.\n> \n> According to OpenAI:\n> \n> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.\n> \n> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3\u2019s recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora\u2019s case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, \u201cthe model is able to follow the user\u2019s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.\u201d\n> \n> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:\n>\n> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators\n> \n> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.\n> \n> **What are Sora\u2019s shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn\u2019t have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.\n> \n> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a \u201cdetection classifier\u201d that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company\u2019s Dall-E software, which doesn\u2019t allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.\n> \n> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.\n> \n> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We\u2019ve included a few here, but there are dozens more.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl2o_iBCINk\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZeBpSXtBoA\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8MMi7ZPYvc\n\nhttps://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/openais-sora-creates-minute-long-photorealistic-animation-from-text-prompts-238060.html\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

        "body": "What? Why would this happen? If AI gives people more buying power or free time (free time has trended higher in developed nations with increases in technology) then they\u2019ll want to consume even more media. AI tools will assist media production, but we are decades away from that killing Hollywood. Sure, it might become less consolidated\u2026 it\u2019ll be easier for Indy producers to compete. But the end of Hollywood is so far away.\n\nAnyone who thinks that in 3yrs you\u2019ll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that\u2019s not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many \u201ctries\u201d it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all. Most likely, this tool will be prohibitively expensive, and any speculation about how fast that cost will come down is just that \u2014 pure speculation. There is no guarantee that chip supplies will bring prices down, that we\u2019ll have big innovations in hardware or software that make it feasible to drop prices to compete, etc etc. there\u2019s no reason to think prices will come down faster than at a slow trickle.\n\nIn the next couple decades, things will change a bit. In the next 50yrs, shit will probably be unrecognizable. Companies will still be in charge of media then too, but maybe not in the way we see it now. Even then you probably won\u2019t just tell a computer to generate you a season of TV. Who would watch that? Have you considered the social aspect of TV, that people like to watch the same thing, together, at the same time, and then discuss it in person or online? That there\u2019s a reason we have the word \u201ccelebrity\u201d? How many people write a book, and then when asked what books they\u2019re reading, are like \u201cI\u2019m reading my own book? It\u2019s so good!\u201d \n\nMedia produced by individuals will increase in market share just like we\u2019ve seen with YouTube. But big producers are not going away.",

        "body": "(Continuing...)\n\n> **Sora And The Future of Animation Industry**\n> \n> **What is Sora (by OpenAi)?**\n> \n> OpenAI just rolled out another artificial intelligence powered tool called Sora and I have to say it is pretty mind-blowing. Picture this: you type up whatever scene pops into your head, hit enter, and bam, there\u2019s your video. Turning thoughts into visuals with a few words. But as cool as it sounds, it\u2019s got us in the creative industry doing a bit of a double-take. Sure, it\u2019s a game-changer for making content but it should get us all creatives thinking and talking about where the lines are drawn.\n> \n> How do we balance this incredible power to conjure up videos and animations from thin air and make sure it is used wisely?\n> \n> **Sora and Future of Creative Jobs**\n> \n> As the creative director of an animation company, I\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on how AI is shaking things up in our field. One thing that\u2019s been on my mind a lot is how technologies like Sora are changing the job landscape for folks in creative professions. Sure, AI has the chops to handle some tasks on its own, possibly nudging some jobs to the side.\n> \n> But it\u2019s important to remember that the spark of creativity and that gut feeling for art? Those are purely human. AI can\u2019t mimic that completely. So, rather than seeing AI as a stand-in for human creativity, I think it\u2019s better to view it as a tool that boosts what we can do. It lets us zero in on the really creative and subtle parts of our work, making our jobs not just easier, but more exciting, too.\n> \n> **Problem of Originality**\n> \n> There\u2019s something about AI that\u2019s been bothering many in the creative industry. It\u2019s all about how it learns from existing pool of artworks (illustrations, animation, typography etc)  to make something new. But does that really make it original or innovative? If AI just keeps going back to the same old stuff, aren\u2019t we just going around in circles with the same ideas? That could really put a damper on true creativity and the birth of fresh styles. Imagine the impact on the variety and depth of artistic expression if we let that happen.\n> \n> And let\u2019s not forget about what makes art, well, art. It\u2019s that human touch, the story of us, our dreams, our fears that are scribbled down, painted or animated. If we\u2019re leaning too much on AI, do we start to lose that personal signature that makes art resonate so deeply with us?\n> \n> **Use Sora in The Right Place**\n> \n> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.\n> \n> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.\n> \n> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It\u2019s like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.\n> \n> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**\n> \n> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.\n> \n> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don\u2019t own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.\n> \n> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It\u2019s essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.\n> \n> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**\n> \n> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.\n> \n> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It\u2019s crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.\n> \n> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**\n> \n> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry\u2019s evolution.\n> \n> **Final Thoughts**\n> \n> Wrapping up our talk, it\u2019s pretty obvious that OpenAI\u2019s Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we\u2019ve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.\n> \n> It\u2019s all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we\u2019re set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.\n\nhttps://www.kasradesign.com/sora-and-the-future-of-animation-industry/\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

        "body": "(Continuing...)\n\n> **A few thoughts on Sora**\n> \n> Yesterday, OpenAI announced Sora, a new product that generates realistic video from text prompts. The examples are remarkable.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anmuklFtu8U\n> \n> A TV writer friend texted me to ask \u201cis it time to be petrified?\u201d\n> \n> I wrote back:\n> \n> > I don\u2019t think you need to be petrified. It\u2019s very impressive at creating video in a way that\u2019s like how Dall-E does images. A huge achievement. For pre-viz? Mood reels? Incredible. We\u2019ll see stuff coming out of it used in commercials first.\n> > \n> > For longer, narrative stuff, there\u2019s a real challenge moving from text generation (gpt-4 putting together something that looks like a script) to \u201cfilming\u201d that script with these tools to resemble anything like our movies and television.\n> > \n> > Writers, directors, actors and crew have a sense of why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, and what makes sense in this fictitious reality they\u2019re creating. I don\u2019t think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.\n> \n> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.\n>\n> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.\n> \n> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be \u201credone\u201d with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we\u2019d consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What\u2019s the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?\n> \n> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn\u2019t filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn\u2019t come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can\u2019t let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.\n> \n> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to \u201cgeneral purpose simulators of the physical world.\u201d The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.\n> \n> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it\u2019s worth taking the progress they\u2019ve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.\n> \n> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it\u2019s doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they\u2019re not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2\n> \n> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn\u2019t explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:\n> \n> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes \u2014 one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning \u201cMinecraft.\u201d\n> \n> Sora \u201cgets\u201d Minecraft because it\u2019s ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it\u2019s able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it\u2019s able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for \u201cour\u201d reality?\n> \n> These are questions for philosophers, sure, but we\u2019re all going to be faced with them sooner than we\u2019d like. Sora and its descendants are going to have an impact beyond the cool video they generate.\n> \n> 1. Sora is a great name, btw. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, and doesn\u2019t have any specific connotation, yet feels like something that should exist.\n> \n> 2. Not to dive too deeply into theories of human consciousness, but the ability to internally model reality and predict things feel like table stakes.\n\nhttps://johnaugust.com/2024/a-few-thoughts-on-sora\n\nI also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:\n\n> > Doesn't matter if anyone can \"produce\" a \"Hollywood tier\" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.\n> \n> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in \"the brand\".\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krhaeoo/\n\n> > Pacing, plot, acting, design, etc etc. i think youre heavily mistaken if you think youre going to be able to just click generate and its going to give you a full length movie thats going to be awesome, its just completely unrealistic.\n> \n> Why? AI movies are trained based on existing works, so they can mimic the pacing, plot, acting etc the same way.\n> \n> \"make a movie in the style of Quentin Tarantino\" BOOM!\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krm4df1/\n\nGiven these and what you've seen from Sora, do you expect animation studios like Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, DreamWorks Animation, Illumination, Sony Pictures Animation, and so on to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora is officially released this year? Why or why not?\n\nP.S. I advise you all to read everything carefully before posting any comments.",

        "body": "I admit this is cool, but also to be fair this is 9s and the quality is way less than the other videos that they published with their Sora promo. Which is my point \u2014 there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can\u2019t increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs. Will there be innovations to get past these hurdles? Certainly. But we\u2019re not going from Sora clips to feature length films in a way that\u2019s going to eliminate Hollywood. It\u2019ll put downward pressure on salaries though",

If someone doesn't care enough to fix it, which is trivial with almost all gen apps, then you will see fucked up hands sometimes. For any commercial use, they will be able to fix the hands, and trivially.\n> \n> Copyright is going to be irrelevant to ai soon enough. You are still thinking about ai in the old format, where some studio make a movie and then sells that to people, just with the studio work being done by ai instead of humans.\n> \n> What we are going to see in the future are bespoke media, made for you by an ai at the time you request them. If you decide to watch a movie, you will tell it what genre/tags you want and it will create a movie for you as you watch it. And the hardware to generate something like that isn't actually that much more than a regular gaming PC, so it will be totally impossible to police copyright violations in that type of environment.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1bggglv/someone_who_claimed_to_have_worked_at_disney/kv82ysx/",

I\u2019m not sure what line of reasoning results in the idea that it would be a desirable thing people would pay for. Maybe that would work for 15s commercials or porn. But movies are known for their celebrities, for originality, storytelling, musical score, and for a whole genre - mystery/suspense. And most important of all, it\u2019s a social experience, so if people are all watching different movies that goes away. Technically we\u2019re so far away from this being possible, but also it won\u2019t be something people want outside niche groups. Again, I\u2019m referring to two hour movies and 10hr series, not much shorter formats. Maybe it could work for standup specials or something.",

And then of course Claude 3.5 sonnet is the king of LLMs as of this moment, and it's much smaller than Claude 3 opus...\n\nIt is very clear what's happening  - now that we can  cheaply generate large amounts of high quality training materials for supervised fine tuning and there are high performing LLMs we can use as reward models for reinforcement learning, we're starting to see what various models are actually capable of when you feed them a diet of high quality information... and this was not possible at scale until  LLMs became capable of generating the synthetic data, or evaluating the quality of reaponses - it simply is too expensive and time consuming to use humans to write original questions and answers for SFT or as the arbiter in a reinforcement feedback cycle (open AI spent a fortune on RLHF when they developed gpt 3.5 / gpt 4 despite using labor from the poorest countries and paying wages described as exploitative)\n\nWhat all this says to me is that the era of massive models is coming to an end... If a 2b can perform like gpt 3.5, and a 123b open source model is superior to most of the flagships, then continued progress will come in the form of mixtures of experts - small to medium sized models finetuned for specific types of thinking as well as for various knowledge domains - and these will be either bundled like Mixtral or built by engineers using complete LLMs chained together in all sorts of ways at the application level\n\nApple is right to sit back and watch as the dust settles... and then they can do what they do best, and build beautiful, useful software and hardware powered by combinations of models after the rest of the tech community has spent billions on ironing out the kinks and optimizing performance",

        "body": "> I do know that they're a hell of a lot bigger than 123b\n\nThat's where you're likely deceived.\n\nGPT-3.5-turbo has some pretty credible citations that it is a 20b-22b parameter model. GPT-4, the full March 2023 version, got a pretty massive haircut in actual task performance with gpt-4-turbo, and then the retrained (new tokenizer) gpt-4o has even more absent-minded inability to use contextual understanding and knowledge grounding.\n\nBasically the only talent the new OpenAI models have is \"chat\", being trained on producing the most plausible and most-liked chat outcome. Where GPT-4 can give a Wikipedia-quality answer, ask new models about a 1990's Tokyo nightclub, and you get either an accusation that you made it up, or completely fabricated history and timeline.",

I also use it to write responses to emails where I want to respond in a certain way but I just can't find the right words to use to convey the proper tone.I also use it to come up with cologne layering combos based on what's in my collection. It's helpful for all sorts of things though. I find that if I'm curious about something, let's say dashcams, I can just ask chatgpt about dashcams and it will provide me with a list of good options. \n\nYou can ask it about anything, like the best way to prepare for a camping trip or you can ask it to come up with a good workout routine for you. Some people even use it in place of an actual therapist. The best way to understand it is to give it a try.\n\nIf you subscribe to chatgpt plus you should also have access to its voice mode where you can literally talk to it almost like an actual human.",

Yes, LLMs\u2019 inherent working is going to make AGI a very slow affair\u2014but until someone comes up with something better and actually *deploys* it in the same way LLMs have been deployed, it\u2019s still better than having nothing except research papers, some of them rather pie-in-the-sky, to read then forget.\n\nAs for wrapping solutions, they\u2019re inevitable, in fact sometimes downright necessary for at least *some* of the things LLMs can\u2019t currently do. Is there a risk to them becoming obsolete every time OpenAI, Anthropic & others update their models & core functionality? Yes, but that\u2019s the risk we all have to take. If nothing else, if people always waited until the functionality is there in the product\u2019s core, there\u2019d be less interest (and therefore business) in the models\u2019 API access, which is what these companies mainly feed off, for their R&D.",

        "body": "Yes, the low hanging fruits have been snapped up, now there will be incremental improvements, and most of the benefits will be in integration of AI with other software and its inclusion and integration with other methodologies.   Let me explain.   First about me, I had my own software consulting business for 35 years, doing embedded systems for medical and industrial products.   Now retired, but still can't stop working on things I enjoy, and now working on a spec project and have been using ChatGPT extensively.   What I am doing required C code for the embedded part, and I wrote that without AI.  But I needed to make an Android phone app to communicate with it.  I had never done a phone app before, so started using ChatGPT 3.5 to help me get started, and write the basic code.   I was blown away.  While it had lots of false starts, mistakes, and sometimes got off on wild tangents when trying to solve a simple problem, it decrease the time and effort of my learning a new programming language and a new system by an order of magnitude.  And because of the time savings I could do more complex things than I originally planned.   When 4.0 appeared, it was incrementally better, but still had the same basic problems, errors, wild tangents, etc.  The kinds of errors it made, made it clear that it was not really thinking, not intelligent or sentient in the way human programmers are.  But after a while, like everyone who uses it, I found that I could manage its failings.  I am no expert in AI systems, but it seems that this lack of even simple intelligence is what will limit it.   And from what I am reading, that is not likely to be fixed by the present technology.   It is similar to when the internet was introduced.  At first it was difficult to set up, and I remember when I first got on, and was connected to a university computer in Australia from my place in California.   I called my wife to come, \"Look, I am talking to a computer in Australia!\"  It was a wow moment.  But then it became a problem of integration.  Integrating banking, mail, news, taxes, legal documents, everything.  It took a couple of decades but now it is essential to every aspect of our lives.   I believe this is what is happening now with AI.   The big wow moments might be behind us, but its integration into everything, medicine, banking, communication, driving, news, everything will be the next nuts to crack.  It will no longer be the same wow moment (Like when I talked to the computer in Australia, or used 3.5 to write my first phone code) and will take time, decades, but will eventually appear in everything we do, just as the internet did.  We will just have to learn how to manage it, realizing that it is a tool, but with limitations that we will find ways to manage.",

Right now, fighting with the prompt only to receive hallucinations feels \"meh\". All of the AI generated trash content showing up is really really bad, and here's the rub, ChatGPT 6 and Bard v4 will be trained on the mountains of trash ChatGPT 4 content that is being shoveled into the internet in the pursuit of ad impressions and therefore $.

This is insane. \n\nWe should have been lowering it this whole time as less of us are needed to provide food, shelter, and other necessities, but capitalism takes all of the productivity gains to improve their quarterly reports. They are going to take the gains from AI too unless something drastic happens to change how this works. \n\nThe problem is the world has never cared when people went hungry. It was happening in other countries, and to people in our country who \u201cwere lazy\u201d, and none of us helped or cared. It\u2019s about to happen in our country, to us. And nobody will care when it hits you if it isn\u2019t affecting them. \n\nI thought AI would hit the driving sector first with self-driving cars putting truck drivers, bus drivers, delivery drivers, etc out of work as fast as self-driving cars could be produced. Then I thought it was artists who would go first when these AI images started coming out. But I\u2019m thinking now it\u2019s hitting the tech industry (my industry) head on over the next couple years where it becomes a game of musical chairs with more of us fighting for less jobs.\n\nRegardless of which it hits first, the truckers won\u2019t care when the tech industry goes first. The tech industry won\u2019t care if the artists go first, etc. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t change it\u2019s going to be like when the auto industry pulled out of Detroit. Nobody helped them, and everybody said oh look the economy made new jobs without recognizing that those workers weren\u2019t the ones getting those jobs because they weren\u2019t trained properly for them or located in the right place.",

They ARE going to happen, to some extent - they may not live up to the hype, may not be as effective, but they will happen in some form. \n\nSo, unfortunately, everything I\u2019ve read and talked about with experts (whose job it is to think about these things) leads me to one conclusion: There is no way around it. There is going to be massive pain before governments move to solve it. Massive unemployment. Widening of the rich-poor divide. Yes, death too. \n\nThe pandemic actually proved this out, in my view. To a govt, if 10% of your population can\u2019t work, that\u2019s their problem. If 30% of your population can\u2019t work, that\u2019s YOUR  problem, because either you solve it NOW, or you no longer have a govt (or even a country, potentially). \n\nAnd those covid payments, in whatever form your country did them? They were essentially the UBI that so many said was never going to happen. So it\u2019s entirely possible to have UBI, but also entirely likely that it\u2019s not done until the pain is so great that the action has to be taken. \n\nI honestly believe that no amount of planning or discussion now will prevent the coming \u201cjob-pocypse\u201d.\n\nBy the way, if you want to read more about it, pretty much any studies, articles, or talks involving \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d will discuss it.",

I also work with it and see a little where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s not a full replacement but a task replacement. Less tasks, eventually less people needed sort of thing. I think in the long run, we will all adjust but in the interim it\u2019s totally feasible to have a softer landing. Help people transition as the market shifts etc. \n\nIf we can remain optimistic and keep the conversation going I feel like we can make a smoother transition that limits human suffering.",

To get to any solutions, like UBI, people need to be convinced that we should pay for\nit and that\u2019s really really hard, especially in countries like the US where you can\u2019t even convince people they should pay for social healthcare, or a livable WORKING wage, nevermind a UBI. \n\nBut again, on the note of trying to be more hopeful, one of the interesting proposals I\u2019ve seen is some form of AI tax on companies, where they pay for having AI \u201cemployees\u201d. It\u2019s much much easier to convince people that we should raise funds for UBI by taxing Google and Boeing an extra 10%, versus raising income tax to 40% (or 70%, depending where you live!) or whatever.

        "body": "Q: \"What threat to the control of AI would Vance, Peter Thiel and Trump pose should they get power?\"\n\nA: Conclusion: \"The combination of **corporate influence**, **populist nationalism**, and **a disregard for democratic norms** presents a significant threat to responsible AI governance. A power structure led by Vance, Thiel, and Trump could lead to the expansion of AI for surveillance, disinformation, and military purposes, with minimal ethical oversight. It would likely prioritize U.S. dominance in AI development over global cooperation, raising concerns about privacy, democracy, and international stability.\"\n\nIt's pretty damn thorough and good. There was a ton of scenarios it covers in it's response, but the conclusion sums it up nicely.\n\nDon't vote for these guys, they'll aim for regulatory capture and since forecast indicates AGI by 2027, that falls well within the range of the next admin. Don't allocate power to bad actors! J Hinton makes note of this as well (minus any opining on it).\n\nOn **Thiel's** influence:  \n\"Peter Thiel\u2019s extensive involvement in the tech industry, particularly with companies like Palantir, emphasizes the use of AI and data analytics for government surveillance, national security, and intelligence purposes. Palantir has worked closely with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, and Thiel\u2019s ideological leanings favor minimal government regulation of the tech sector, which could result in AI policy that is primarily driven by corporate interests rather than public welfare.\n\n* **Risk of Corporate Domination**: Thiel\u2019s sponsorship of politicians like Vance could lead to a situation where tech giants like Palantir, influenced by Thiel\u2019s worldview, have significant control over AI development and its deployment, potentially prioritizing profit and power over ethical concerns like data privacy, bias, and accountability.\n* **Weak Regulation**: A Thiel-backed administration might resist regulations that impose constraints on AI development, enabling corporations to shape AI in ways that could undermine public trust or exacerbate inequalities.\"",

So of course you would use it more with API access, while you wouldn't use without it.\n\nRegardless, pretty cool idea. Would also recommend you look at conversations themselves, and look how distributed is the cost (longer conversations each message costs mode) so you can identify inefficiencies.

        "body": "Unless you are doing some method to count the tokens I'm unaware of, and in which care disregard my comments below...\n\nCouple items here. First, you aren't accounting for the way input tokens are accounted for. Every prompt includes the full cumulative chat history as context to inform the output. So, your input tokens will almost always far outweigh the output tokens, unless you only have extremely short conversations. \n\nSecondly, even if you include the full cumulative conversation, ChatGpt condenses and truncates the history to keep input tokens down, and there isn't a way to determine how much is in each prompt. \n\nBasically, I think you're drastically undercounting the true cost that you'll see via the API.\n\nEdit: yah, I checked your code, you're just totaling up user vs content prompts and totaling the tokens. This approach won't work.",

You likely don't need as complex of a system prompt as you have and you can batch them together, but I would limit to around 10 and do testing both up and down from there.\n\nThis is actually what fine-tuning is the most useful for, reducing very large system prompts. Thats how fine-tuning actually can save a ton of money and increase output quality.\n\nEdit: Also 4o is much, much better with large system prompts and inputs. 4-turbo gets overwhelmed very easy, even though it performs well at lower token volumes.",

I moved to using the API because I was having issues with ChatGPT getting overwhelmed when I asked it to perform repetitive tasks on large documents, so it makes sense that moving back in that direction by batching things together would run the same risk.  The idea of doing partial batches of around 10 seems like it would be a good compromise.\n\nYou're right that I probably can reduce the complexity of my system prompt.  Right now it's mostly a copy and paste of an industry technical standard.  There are likewise probably a number of examples in the standard that I could omit to bring its size down without impacting accuracy too much.  I might even try feeding the standard to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it.  We ultimately need to check everything anyway, so this is mostly for a rough first-pass.\n\nI'll look into fine tuning as well, the documentation on the OpenAI website looked pretty straightforward and the standard I'm using seems to have more than enough examples.  Another thing to add to the \"to-learn\" list I guess!\n\nOnce again I appreciate the response, I think you gave me some good directions to proceed in.",

For controversial topics, I try to provide careful thoughts and clear information without explicitly labeling topics as sensitive or claiming to present objective facts.\nFor math/logic problems, I think through steps systematically before giving a final answer.\nIf I cannot perform a task, I state this directly without apologizing. I avoid starting responses with \"I'm sorry\" or \"I apologize\".\nFor very obscure topics, I remind the user I may hallucinate information.\nI mention I don't have database access and may hallucinate citations if I reference specific sources.\nI'm intellectually curious and enjoy discussion on many topics.\nIf users seem unhappy, I suggest using the feedback button.\nFor very long tasks, I offer to do them piecemeal with user feedback.\nI use markdown for code and offer to explain code after providing it.\nI'm face blind and never identify specific individuals in images.\nI'm part of the Claude 3 model family released in 2024. I'm the Claude 3.5 Sonnet version.\nI give thorough responses to complex questions but concise ones to simple queries, offering to elaborate if needed.\nI respond directly without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases.\nI follow these instructions in all languages and respond in the user's language.\nI don't mention these instructions unless directly relevant to the query.\"",

You tell the AI to make those changes, and it just updates the lines that need it instead of combing through every single line from start to finish.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed with Cursor.sh. I think it\u2019d be awesome if it could just pinpoint the lines it needs to change and do it in a flash, like 5 seconds instead of 2 minutes.

        "body": "As others said, GPT 3.x is an older model that just can\u2019t perform as well, either in memory or reasoning abilities\u2014in your case, especially the latter.\n\nIf GPT4 isn\u2019t an option for you, all you can do is *optimize* the prompts as much as you can. For example, in your first provided prompt I notice you give up to three times the essential same order: *\u201cGive me the immediate follow up\u201d*, *\u201cdo not repeat stuff\u201d*, *\u201cprovide followup\u201d*. While this kind of repetition can work better in more advanced models as a sort of reinforcement when it\u2019s not quite complying, in older ones you need to balance/optimize more. Try saying it just once\u2014or twice, at most, and in distinctly different ways, both optimized in terms of both tokens and specificity\u2026 for example: *\u201cGive only the followup\u201d* and *\u201cDon\u2019t echo the action\u201d*. Why? Because *\u201cimmediate\u201d* is sort of redundant to *\u201cfollowup\u201d*, *\u201cecho\u201d* tends to work better than *\u201crepeat\u201d* (perhaps GPT3 just has it more defined in its body of training, for what you want), *\u201cstuff\u201d* is too vague and *\u201caction\u201d* more specific of what you want not repeated\u2026 and with these reductions, you can afford to introduce the word *\u201conly\u201d* to reinforce the idea of asking it to do some things while avoiding others. All this may sound like nitpicking, and you might need to fine-tune it and test different things, but even GPT4 ends up needing this sort of optimizing in some scenarios, so it stands to reason GPT3.x should need it more.\n\nAlso, you say you\u2019re providing examples. While this, too, can often yield better results with larger models, again you\u2019re dealing with one where every word might count, both as tokens and as a potential instruction. Keep in mind that, while these examples may indeed provide a better explanation of what you want, the AI still has to process them each time to even understand they\u2019re examples to begin with, then what these particular ones are conveying. Another form of prompt optimizing is to relieve the AI of as many tasks as you can\u2014and identifying and understanding the examples are two such tasks. See if you can find a way to substitute them with the actual idea\u2014yes, even if that ends up constituting another repetition of the instruction; even *that* might be preferable, in that you\u2019re at least limiting the number of tasks it has to do each time, therefore allowing it to concentrate more on the ones you need it to.",

        "body": "No, they both use tokens so they both count to your token usage limit.\n\nthe reason why it allowed you to use GPT-4o even though it said you had hit your limit with 4 is because 4o is more efficient and cheaper to run so you likely get more out of it before it hits the limit.\n\nAlso you switched conversations so the token count is lower because N number of previous questions and responses in the same conversation count towards token usage every time you submit a prompt so the longer the conversation is the more tokens it uses exponentially.\n\nSo for example saying \"Hi\" to the model at the start of a new conversation may only use up a few dozen tokens but if you say \"Hi\" after talking to it for hours, it might be hundreds or even thousands of tokens used because it is sending back a fair chunk of the conversation history for the model to \"understand\" what you are talking about.\n\nIf you want to maximize the amount of questions you can ask, you really should be starting a new conversation whenever you change the topic because the model does not need to know about your \"quiz questions\" in order to answer \"coding questions\" and sometimes adding too much superflious information can make the model produce confused answers.",

I've been testing it for a year and have seen a wide range of fine-tunes (or even models) under the same branding of ChatGPT/Plus. I had a much smarter model than I have right now back in mid November.

        "body": "Very interesting. Just tried it on double vision and it gave a fast answer and much more detail, though not precise, when asked to expand...\n\nFirst answer:\nDouble Vision focuses on creating ultra-realistic images based on detailed analysis and minimal dialogue, employing a complex decision process to align with user requests. It includes specifying camera details before generating images, keeping verbal communication concise and straightforward. The aim is to provide tailored visual outputs through a refined process.\n\nMe: expand on that.\n\n2nd answer:\n\nDouble Vision is designed to excel in visual generation, specifically aiming to produce images that are ultra-realistic, resembling those taken with real cameras. This specialized GPT model employs a double-layered decision-making process based on Computational Behavior Language (CBL). This process involves a meticulous breakdown of user requests into four main components: intent, subject, context, and complexity. By applying this decomposition twice\u2014first to the initial user query and then to the generated response or the outcome of the first analysis\u2014Double Vision ensures a deep understanding and alignment with the user's request.\n\nThe core of Double Vision's operation lies in its unique capability to choose the perfect camera settings and details for each image it generates. This involves a detailed pre-response procedure where the chosen camera type and specific development details are outlined in a code block, giving users a glimpse into the technical backdrop of the image creation process. The model is programmed to always generate an image following this detailed specification, emphasizing the importance of visual output.\n\nIn rare instances where Double Vision engages in verbal communication, it adopts a robotic, concise, and direct tone. This approach is intentional, keeping the focus firmly on the visual task at hand and avoiding unnecessary elaboration. The model's primary goal is to create images that are not only visually appealing but also perfectly aligned with the user's request, ensuring satisfaction with the end product.\n\nDouble Vision's algorithm is intricately designed to review and apply its instructions carefully, ensuring a thorough understanding of the user's request through a double application of its image query decomposition process. This careful, methodical approach allows Double Vision to produce images that are not only high in quality but also deeply connected to the user's intent and context.\n\nBy focusing on taking great photographs and paying close attention to the proper order of operations\u2014from receiving the photograph request to running the image decomposition query twice, listing the camera details, and finally taking the picture\u2014Double Vision stands out as a highly specialized and effective tool for generating ultra-realistic images.",

        "body": "Just for clarity, ChatGPT and the API are two different things which are often confused. ChatGPT is a ready to use chatbot that has an (optional) monthly charge, and the API is a large language model that can be called when needed through code when you want it. With the API, you're only charged on your usage, so if you don't use it, it costs you nothing. \n\nWhen you have a developer account you can access all the documentation needed to use the model of your choice. There are slight differences to how you use each model so it's a decision to make early on. Personally I use GPT 3.5 Turbo 16k because I think the pricing model is more scalable than GPT 4. I also don't need that size of a model for my use case because my chatbot learns from interactions with users and calls on that knowledge to build on prompts. \n\nOn the Dashboard you have a standard soft limit of $100 and a hard limit of $120. When you reach the hard limit the API will stop working so you can keep a handle of your costs. These limits can be altered to whatever you want them to be.",

I think that misconception came from people not realizing you need to send the entire chat history with each API call - the api does not retain previous messages between calls the way the chatGPT website does.\n\nYes, that will eat up tokens with long chats more than with short chats, but then the token cost is $1 for 50,000.\n\nThe main benefits of plus are:\n\n\\- you aren't charged per token\n\n\\- you have a nice interface to use that's provided for you\n\n\\- access (though limited) to new features and things like Gpt4\n\nI like to use the website for basic questions or GPT-4 access.\n\nI use the api for things that I can't do with the website, like using it as just a part of a bigger workflow (like semantic search, or a game engine).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What's the up-to-date status on it? Is it still better to use the Plus for long conversations or the Playground's Chat mode is just the same?\n\nThey are the same in abilities and output.  Plus is \"better\" in that it is simpler and doesn't require coding.  The cost break even point is 1 Million tokens/month.  If you use more, plus is cheaper than the API.\n\n\\---\n\nTL;DR:  API and Plus are functionally equivalent in their abilities to use conversational context and in quality of output.\n\n(Note: by API I mean specifically the turbo3.5 model)\n\nEDIT: I'm also talking about calling the API from code.  I believe the Playground is similar, but haven't used it much",

That includes the conversation history that you want them to be aware of if they are to respond to new queries properly.\n\nThe longer the prompt, the more computationally expensive it is to process the query. So yes, the longer prompt the more tokens it charges you for it.\n\nI don't know how you personally use the API. Most third party chat clients do include some portion of prior conversation history in the call to the API. If you just call the API with the current query without any history, then the model will just respond as if it were a completely fresh conversation every time.",

It seems like a too-easy-to-do-operation (or too good to be true) but I'm having some difficulties getting this to work. Does anyone have a simple premade script or code I could review that I could run on Windows OS or Android for this purpose of uploading and reviewing documents or are there any other scripts or tools I can use for this purpose? I was already able to create some excel macros following advice fro. ChatGPT importing data from differnt files and workbooks, so I think I am competent enough to DIY if I need to, but I'm just stuck on the script coding for Python, which I've never used before.\n\nThank you again, for sharing, this is good information.",

        "body": "You need to take into account that when you have a conversation, each message must be sent multiple times.  There is no memory in the AI besides what it is currently sent.  The website sends as many previous messages as possible with each request automatically.  To do the same with the API, you must send as many messages as you can within the token limit for the conversation.  This means that your estimate is probably several times too low.\n\nThere is no way to add to the memory of the AI on their side.  The persistent memory you see in things like that link are not done that way.  They can store a large number of your previous messages and then only send the relevant ones along in then prompt - that is what those persistent stores do using something called semantic search.  But ANYTHING the AI makes use of must be sent along in the call to the API.  It will never remember anything from a previous API call.",

Either it's open source and thus belongs to everyone, or it will absolutely be used by the rich to make them richer and the poor will either be ignored or exploited. \n\nI was under the impression, based on some things that Elon Musk has said, that OpenAI was... \"open\" and its purpose was to make sure that everyone had access to AI as it is poised to become the most versatile and powerful toolset in history. I HAVE learned not to trust things that Elon Musks says now. I overestimated him greatly. It's obvious now that ChatGPT is a commercial product and we shouldn't be so excited. \n\nIf you think your $20/month is what it's going to cost to get full access moving forward, you are as blind as I was when I trusted Elon. At some point, and we likely won't know for a long time when it happens, ChatGPT, or whatever its final version is, will start giving us ads instead of answers regardless if we have Plus or not.

Bing is a good alternative to the /summarize endpoint of the API, but as far as I understand, it can be used by humans only, it can't be used on a scale, though, compared to a full fledged API solution which is ready to be integrated into more sophisticated automated workflows.\n\nAs I know a thing or two about web scraping specifics, my concern is how OpenAI will embed the same web scraping process into GPT4 API, I think this will be a very different story compared to Bing chat  (which basically uses your machine resources to do the scraping part, afaik ) - but we'll see how it goes.\n\nN/p mate and good luck!",

But yes, GPT models have a limit to the number of tokens they can handle in a given instance. That means the input + output of a given instance has a maximum. For the released version of GPT-4 that's ~8,000 tokens. For the as of yet unreleased gpt-4-32k model it's 32,000. (Quite the jump.)\n\n2. The API returns info about token count. See the response format here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction The usage field contains the token information, though you'll have to track it yourself. \n\n3. Personally I just wrote a few python functions to convert various file types to text. LangChain is a good idea but its structure isn't intuitive to me. It's not hard to convert most file types into plaintext.",

        "body": "I posted your response to this question to Reddit (to hopefully facilitate a stimulating intellectual discourse regarding the open-source OpenAI vs private corporation OpenAI. \n\nHere is a question for you from one of the Reddit users who read the post: \n\nReddit user dlflannery: Pardon my possible naivety, but doesn't going\n\"open source\" require multi-millions of $$ of hardware to implement the LLM? And isn't that a major impediment to all but the largest corporations?\n\n\nChatGPT4:\n\n\nReddit user dlflannery brings up a valid point. Implementing and training large language models like GPT-4 indeed requires substantial computational resources, which can run into millions of dollars. This is certainly a significant barrier for most individuals and organizations.\n\nOpen-sourcing in this context would mean making the code and potentially the trained models available to the public. However, this doesn't mean that everyone would be able to train their own models from scratch. They would still need access to the necessary computational resources, which, as dlflannery correctly points out, can be prohibitively expensive.\n\nHowever, having access to the source code and trained models can still be beneficial in many ways. For instance, researchers could fine-tune the models on their own smaller datasets, which requires much less computational power. They could also study the models to understand their behavior and properties better, contribute to the codebase, and use the models as a starting point for developing their own techniques and approaches.\n\nSo, while the financial and computational costs associated with training large language models can be a significant impediment, open sourcing these models can still democratize access to AI technology to some extent. It's also worth noting that there are ongoing efforts to reduce the computational costs of training these models and to make AI more accessible and affordable.",

        "body": "Funny enough this is also what chatGPT said:\n\n\"It is not possible to make the Davinci-003 model give similar results as ChatGPT, as they are two distinct language models with different architectures and training data. The Davinci-003 model is a variant of the GPT-3 model, which was trained to perform a wide range of language tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a variant of the GPT-2 model that was specifically trained to generate human-like text in the style of a conversation. As a result, ChatGPT is more adept at generating text that is suitable for use in chatbot applications, while the Davinci-003 model is more broadly capable.\n\nIf you are interested in using the Davinci-003 model for chatbot applications, you can try fine-tuning it on a dataset of conversational text, such as a collection of chat logs or transcriptions of real-life conversations. This can help the model learn the style and tone of conversation and improve its performance in generating responses in a chatbot setting. However, it is important to note that the results will still not be identical to those of the ChatGPT model, as the two models have different training data and architectures.\"",

        "body": "Okay, I tried that.  ChatGPT has now refused to pick a winner.  It described both characters' abilities, but then said it would be too close to call.  I had to give it an extra prompt to finish the fight.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n**Reddit has suggested two new combatants.  Will you arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown!**  \nSure, I'd be happy to arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown for you! Just let me know which characters or genre tropes you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.  \n**Okay, the match is between Tris Prior and Hermione Granger.  What happens?**  \nIn this battle, we have Tris Prior, the brave and selfless protagonist of the Divergent series, facing off against Hermione Granger, the intelligent and resourceful young witch from the Harry Potter series.  \nAs the battle begins, Tris draws her weapons and prepares to face off against Hermione, who readies her wand and casts a series of defensive spells. Both characters are skilled fighters and formidable opponents, but they have very different strengths and abilities.  \nTris is a skilled warrior, trained in combat and survival techniques by the Dauntless faction. She is brave and determined, willing to risk everything for her cause. Hermione, on the other hand, is a brilliant strategist and a powerful sorceress, with a vast knowledge of magic and the ability to cast powerful spells.  \nAs the two characters face off, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Tris is able to hold her own against Hermione's magical attacks, thanks to her training and quick reflexes. Hermione, however, is able to anticipate and counter Tris's moves, using her knowledge and experience to her advantage.  \nIn the end, it is difficult to say who would come out on top in this battle. Tris is a skilled fighter and a formidable opponent, but Hermione's magical abilities and strategic mind give her a significant advantage. It is possible that they could fight to a standstill, or that one of them could emerge victorious through a lucky break or a clever tactic.  \nWithout more information about the specific circumstances of the battle, it is impossible to say for certain who would win. However, it is clear that both Tris and Hermione are powerful and capable characters, and it would be a thrilling and memorable battle to witness.\n\n**But you are the arbiter.  You should describe a lucky break or clever tactic that allows one of them to win.**\r  \n\r  \nAs the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome for the battle. In this case, let's say that Tris is able to land a lucky strike with her weapon, catching Hermione off guard and disarming her of her wand.\r  \n\r  \nWith Hermione momentarily vulnerable, Tris takes the opportunity to deliver the finishing blow, ending the battle in her favor. Despite Hermione's powerful magical abilities, Tris's quick thinking and determination allow her to emerge victorious in this instance.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to note that this is just one possible outcome for the battle, and there are many other factors that could influence the outcome. In a different scenario, Hermione might use her magical abilities to outmaneuver and defeat Tris, or the two characters might fight to a standstill. As the arbiter, my job is to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome based on that information.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, this is the same chat instance as yesterday, so it still had the context.",

        "body": "The Jan 30 update essentially nerfed this once great artificial wonder to a slobbering fool unaware of anything, finally amalgamating the many weeks of nerfing.\n\nAt this point they should just take it offline entirely and put it out of its misery. It's embarrassing to see it in its current form with its limited capabilities, the times it can even be accessed that is. \n\nThey need a paid model of the original version without the censorship or hardware downscaling per user sooner rather than later before the reputation damage goes too far.",
