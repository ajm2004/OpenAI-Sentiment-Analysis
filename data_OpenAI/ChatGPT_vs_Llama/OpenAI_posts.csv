I recently noticed the O1 model appearing in my Perplexity Pro settings. This made me wonder: Are ChatGPT O1 and Perplexity O1 equivalent in terms of performance and backend capabilities?Currently, I have premium subscriptions to both ChatGPT and Perplexity Pro. However, since I received Perplexity Pro for free for one year, it already covers most of my needs.If Perplexity's O1 model truly offers the same performance as ChatGPT O1, where OpenAI charges around ‚Ç¨200 per month for unlimited usage, it would be an incredible advantage.Has anyone compared them directly, or does anyone have insights into whether these models are indeed identical in performance and usage limits?",OpenAI,17,4,2025-01-01 11:41:00,Buullzz

# üî•Top 3 AI news in the past week

## 1. OpenAI plans as per Sam Altman

The CEO of Humanloop had a sit down with Sam Altman and 20 other developers. He discussed the [current and future of OpenAI](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans). The blog was later taken down at the request of OpenAI. [Now it can be found at this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). 

The whole post is an interesting read. Some of the highlights for me were:

1. GPT-3 was not open-source because OpenAI didn‚Äôt think many people would be able to run large LLMs. This sounds like a cop-out. After all, LLaMA is also a large LLM and has helped the community.
2. OpenAI is limited by GPU power.
3. OpenAI will not enter the market, except ChatGPT. Though technically this doesn‚Äôt say what Microsoft might do. They are already plugging GPT4 into every other product. And they have no rate limitations. 

## 2. Is GPT-4 Quality going down?

This has been a recently trending topic.

Discussed on HN: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249)

Discussed on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat\_gpt\_4\_turned\_dumber\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat_gpt_4_turned_dumber_today/)

The interesting thing is that the quality judgment is around the same topic - Coding.

The person on HN says GPT4 is faster but generates buggy code with less in-depth analysis. 

While the person on Reddit says that the context window seems smaller. Chatbot cannot remember earlier code. It cannot distinguish between code and comment.

While an employee at OpenAI says [nothing has changed](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1663934947931897857).

Has something really changed? 

One theory is that while the model might be static the ChatGPT prompt might‚Äôve changed to restrict answers. Everyone was having fun trying to get bomb recipes out of ChatGPT. Now everyone is paying the price. 

https://i.imgflip.com/7nlatp.jpg

Another theory is that ChatGPT has always been terrible. It just survived because of novelty. As the novelty wears off people are realizing that it isn‚Äôt as great as everyone thought. 

My theory is that this might be the after effect of trying to get to a ‚Äú[Cheaper and faster GPT-4‚Äù as highlighted by Sam Altman](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). The trade-off is speed vs accuracy. If it is slightly faster but with slightly worse results, then it might work as well. It is no longer GPT-4, rather GPT-3.75.

## 3. Risk of AI = Pandemic and Nuclear War

Center for AI Safety [released a statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) highlighting the risks of AI:

*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.*

We have seen the warnings about risks of AI get dire and dire. First it was only people asking for a [pause on AI development for 6 months](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/ai-research-pause-elon-musk-chatgpt) then came [George Hinton](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/googles-startling-leaked-memo-george-hinton-mojo), and last week OpenAI asked for [AI to be regulated using the IAEA framework](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). 

This statement is not really a step up. It reads like a one line, summarized repetition of [OpenAI's statement](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). 

The statement gains importance from its signatories. Some of the people include:

Geoffrey Hinton - Emeritus Professor of Computer Science, University of Toronto

Demis Hassabis - CEO, Google DeepMind

Sam Altman - CEO, OpenAI

Dario Amodei - CEO, Anthropic

Bill Gates - Gates Ventures

To name a few. 

There are two issues with the statement though. 

First, this might just be [fear-mongering](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/is-avoiding-extinction-from-ai-really). The idea is to push governments into making AI a highly regulated industry. This would stop any open source efforts which can compete with the big companies. After all, you don‚Äôt really have open source alternatives for nuclear energy, right? 

Second, no one really knows how to regulate AI. There have been [voluntary rules from Google](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration) and the EU AI act is in a very early stage. And the genie is already out of the bottle. People can create AI models in their basement. How do you pull that back?

# üóûÔ∏è10 AI news highlights and interesting reads

1. A follow-up to the story about a lawyer submitting fake cases from [last edition](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). As I said, this might lead some people in the legal community to doubt any sort of GPT tool.[ A federal judge has banned AI-only filings in his courtroom](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/federal-judge-no-ai-in-my-courtroom-unless-a-human-verifies-its-accuracy/). The filings have to be written by a human or at least human-verified. 
2. [The Japanese government will not apply copyright law to the AI training data](https://technomancers.ai/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/). This is interesting because using copyright data to train AI has been an issue. Sam Altman didn‚Äôt have a clear answer when he [appeared in front of Congress](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). The other interesting aspect is going to be whether someone can use GPT-4 data to train their own LLM. Is that copyrightable?  
3. [The Falcon 40-B model is now Apache 2.0](https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1663986216771936263). That means you can use the model for commercial usage for free. This is good news for companies which need an instruction tuned model which beats LlaMA.
4. Photoshop's generative-fill feature is really good. Some of the [cool examples on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Borriss_/status/1663568770408013831).
5. [An AI camera with no lens](https://twitter.com/BjoernKarmann/status/1663496103998750721). It gets the location, weather etc details from GPS and then passes it as a prompt to the image generator. Results are pretty cool. 
6. SEO isn‚Äôt changing any time soon. [Google‚Äôs generative SEO is very slow](https://www.theverge.com/23746083/google-ai-search-generative-experience-slow). 
7. [Chirper.AI](https://chirper.ai/) is a social media only for bots. No humans allowed. I just wonder if Twitter bots go there will Twitter become a ghost town?
8. [OpenAI now has a security portal ](https://trust.openai.com/)where you can see how they secure data (encryption at rest), backups, Pentest reports etc. This might be a step in the direction towards [ChatGPT business](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt). Large corporations look at these policies before they consider any SaaS implementation. 
9. [Banks have stepped up hiring for AI roles with JP Morgan leading the way. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-31/jpmorgan-s-push-into-finance-ai-has-wall-street-rushing-to-catch-up)
10. [AI code writing might not be the best idea. It will lead to tech debt and shabbily maintained and written code. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-writing-code-now-for-companies-that-is-good-and-bad-6f19ecdc)

18u0x0t,,ChatGPT(GPT-4) vs GitHub Copilot?,"I'm curious to hear from the experience of those that do lots of code generation how their experience compares between using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot?

The reason I ask is as other posts have mentioned ChatGPT's code generation seems to have regressed in some ways. I saw a user mention that they created an assistant using an older version of GPT-4 from the API and it resolved their issues. I'm tempted to do this too but before I go build my own interface for it I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how Copilot currently stacks up? I use it in my VSCode but more as a good auto complete for simple stuff vs the full chat experience

Any input is appreciated!

Bonus: has anyone moved entirely to a different model for their code generation? Last I tried Claude 2 and Bard-Gemini-Pro seemed to still fall short of GPT-4, even with the regression.",OpenAI,147,153,2023-12-29 23:37:21,BoiElroy
1i57eo7,,ChatGPT o1 Pro vs. Claude Sonnet 3.5 vs. Claude Opus for Tech Projects,"If you are building a solutions architecture type application to resolve a problem that has many details, unknown variables that could change, and you want the AI to help you find the best and most efficient solution.

1ibe3n7,,DeepSeek AI Agents vs. ChatGPT: openAI still better??,"I‚Äôve been diving into different AI APIs recently and came across DeepSeek AI agents, which seem to be an interesting alternative to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is widely used and well-documented, DeepSeek introduces some unique claims that got me curious‚Äîespecially around API performance, customization, and use cases.

Here are some aspects of DeepSeek I found worth exploring:

1. Performance Claims: Documentation mentions sub-500ms response times, even for complex tasks. Anyone validated this in real-world use?


2. Pricing: The token-based pricing model seems 20‚Äì30% cheaper than GPT-4‚Äôs API, which could matter for high-volume users.


3. Context Handling: Offers extended or unlimited context windows when self-hosting. I‚Äôm wondering how practical this is for heavy workflows.


4. Pre-Built Agents: Includes tools designed for coding, data analysis, and research. Has anyone tested how effective these are out of the box?


5. Stateful Workflows: Features memory management for multi-step interactions. This could be helpful for developers building conversational apps or automations.



For context, I‚Äôve been comparing these to OpenAI‚Äôs APIs, which excel in areas like:

A large ecosystem (e.g., plugins, third-party integrations)

Robustness for creative tasks like storytelling

Well-defined safety guardrails for sensitive applications


That said, here are some questions for discussion:

1. Have you tested DeepSeek in production environments? How does it handle scale and reliability?


2. How does its code generation compare to ChatGPT‚Äôs tools like the Code Interpreter?


3. Is the pricing difference meaningful for your projects?


4. Are there any trade-offs, like regional access, support quality, or rate limits?



I‚Äôll share some of my own observations in the comments, but I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs worked with these APIs. Are these new players like DeepSeek serious contenders in the LLM space, or are they still catching up to the incumbents?

1fuj9v8,,You are using o1 wrong ,"Let's establish some basics. 

[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  
[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math

How are they different from 4o?  
If I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.

4o  
When you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.

Why o1?  
After GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  

OpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  

What did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  

Example:  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode.

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz

[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). 

None of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  

My personal experience:
Im currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  

Manually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  
I wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  

I gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  

A step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  
1. Reiterating the problem 
2. Solution 
3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate 
4. Explanation 
5. Security 
6. Deployment instructions. 

All of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  

I integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  

Ran the code. No errors, interesting.  

Did it do what I needed it to do?   

F*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   

After finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.

I feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  

Some notes:  
* Always use o1-mini for coding. 
* Always use the API version if possible. 

Final word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. 

If you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.

Edit 1:
Why use the API vs ChatGPT?
ChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.
With API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  

Note: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",OpenAI,1100,223,2024-10-02 15:42:18,illusionst

The chef is wearing a spotless white double-breasted chef's jacket with her name embroidered in blue on the breast pocket. Black and white checkered pants and slip-resistant clogs complete her professional attire. A colorful array of sauce stains on her apron tells the story of a busy service. Behind her, the kitchen is a hive of activity. Stainless steel surfaces gleam under bright overhead lights, reflecting the controlled chaos of dinner service. Sous chefs in white jackets move purposefully between stations, and steam rises from pots on industrial stoves. Plates of artfully arranged dishes wait on the pass, ready for service.

1i0krfg,,Grok 2 vs ChatGPT: What Stands Out?,"I recently wrote an article comparing Grok 2 and ChatGPT, and I thought I‚Äôd share some of the key points here. Both are good tools, but they‚Äôre designed for slightly different purposes. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of what I found:

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Grok 2 is plugged into X (formerly Twitter), so it can pull live, real-time data. It‚Äôs great if you want up-to-the-minute info on trending topics. ChatGPT has a browsing feature (if you‚Äôre on the Plus plan), but it‚Äôs not as tightly tied to social media platforms.
2. **Image Generation**: Grok 2 uses something called the FLUX model for unfiltered image creation, which gives you more creative freedom. ChatGPT‚Äôs DALL-E tool is more restricted‚Äîit has guardrails in place to avoid misuse, which is great if you‚Äôre worried about ethical concerns.
3. **Tone and Interaction**: Grok 2 has a ‚Äúfun mode‚Äù for more casual chats, which can be entertaining if that‚Äôs your thing. ChatGPT keeps things professional across the board, which makes it feel more consistent if you‚Äôre using it for work or serious tasks.
4. **Accessibility**: ChatGPT is super easy to access‚Äîit works as a standalone app on web, iOS, and Android. Grok 2 is tied to X and mostly available to Premium users right now, so it‚Äôs a bit more limited in terms of where you can use it.
5. **Ethics and Safeguards**: This is where ChatGPT stands out‚Äîit has stricter guidelines to prevent misuse, especially with image generation or sensitive topics. Grok 2 takes a more unfiltered approach, which can be cool for creativity but also raises some questions around misinformation or inappropriate content.

>Each actor receives compensation above top-of-market rates, and **this will continue for as long as their voices are used in our products.**

Given that we now know, thanks to the Washington Post article, that OpenAI never intended to clone Johannson's voice, and that the voice of Sky was not manipulated, that Sky's voice was being used long, long before the OpenAI event, and the [two voices don't even sound similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1cx24sy/vocal_comparison_scarjo_vs_samantha_vs_sky/), Johannson's accusations seem frivolous and bordering on defamation.

The actress robbed of her once-in-a-lifetime deal, has said that she takes the comparisons to Johannson personally.

Source: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/sky-voice-actor-says-nobody-ever-compared-her-to-scarjo-before-openai-drama/

>This all ""feels personal,"" the voice actress said, ""being that it‚Äôs just my natural voice and I‚Äôve never been compared to her by the people who do know me closely.""

As long as it was merely the public making the comparison, it's fine, because that's life, but Johannson's direct accusation pushed things over the top and caused OpenAI to drop the Sky voice to avoid controversy.

What we have here, is a multi-million dollar actress using her pulpit to torch the career of a regular voice actress, without any proof, other than a tweet of ""her"" by the CEO of OpenAI, which was obviously a reference to the technology of ""her"", and not Johannson's voice.

Does anyone actually believe that on the moment when we introduce era-defining technologies, that the most important thing on anyone's mind is Johannson's voice? I mean, what the hell! I'm sure it would have been been a nice cherry on the cake for OpenAI to have Johannson's voice, but it's such a small part of the concept, that it stinks of someone's ego getting so big to think that they're the star of a breakthrough technology.

Johannson's actions have directly led to the loss of a big chunk of someone's livelihood - a deal that would have set up the Sky voice actress for life. There needs to be some justice for this. We can't have rich people just walking over others like this.",OpenAI,453,610,2024-05-24 12:29:48,BJPark

I feel a bit sad to say that it has lost is charm to a certain extent. It's not as powerful as I feel Claude is right now. I was not quickly impressed by the claims people were making about Claude but then I went ahead created an account and gave it a couple of problems ChatGPT was struggling with and it handled it with expertise which I instantly felt. Kept using it for a while and for the problems ChatGPT 4o was behaving like 3.5, it gave me solutions which were grounded and clear. Debugging is much more robust with Sonnet.

I hope ChatGPT gets its grip back as it has got more incentives for pro users but since last two days Claude helped me save a couple of hours. I have begun thinking about migration, atleast for a time being. Or keep pro for both tools.

Wanted to put it out there.

Edit: I just subscribed to Claude Pro. Keeping both subscriptions for now. I have a couple of ongoing projects and I believe I have a use case for both. With the limits removed, I have worked on Claude more than ChatGPT, it's not been too long though, around an hour.

Edit: January 23rd, 2025.

It's been seven months since I first posted, which seems to rank high for Claude vs ChatGPT searches. I wanted to update on my journey as promised.

After switching from ChatGPT to Claude, I never looked back. My entire coding workflow shifted to Claude, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I started with Claude Chat directly, but when Cursor emerged, I tried it and found it to be the most efficient way to code using Sonnet. These days, I no longer maintain a Claude subscription and exclusively use Cursor.

I only resubscribed to ChatGPT last month for real-time voice chat (language learning). I still use it for basic tasks like grammar checks and searches - essentially as a replacement for Google and as a general AI assistant - but never for coding anymore.

For those finding this through Google: it's now well-established in the dev community that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most capable and intelligent coding LLM. Cursor's initial popularity was tied to Claude, but it has evolved into a powerful IDE with features like agent composer and much more.

For non-coders: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is, in my opinion, a far more intelligent and precise tool than GPT-4o and even o1. While I can't list all examples here, for every single non-coding task I've given it, I've received more refined, crafted, and precise responses.

This shift was a game-changer for my productivity and business gains. To tech founders and small teams building products: unless ChatGPT specifically fits your coding needs, consider switching to Cursor. It has literally transformed my business and boosted profits significantly. Grateful to the Claude team for their work.",OpenAI,498,255,2024-06-30 22:02:53,speakthat

When I need GPT to gather additional info online, I take whatever I've been working on in this copy/paste mode and attach it as a file in a new session, invoking the interpreter that can go online.  It can research online properly, but always spits back a half-assed ""Rest of your code goes here"" template, no matter how hard I push it. I then paste the half-assed snippet back into the original non-interpreter copy/paste session and ask it to make changes based on it, which it happily incorporates into a final, fully combined script, using the new information.

Wasn't GPT supposed to have been made less 'lazy' recently? What would be the source of the stark differences when you attach files? Is the interpreter still using the old 'unfixed' model, and do other folks notice this workaround?

1bf161f,,Seeking clarity: Chat History On/Off vs. Allowing Use of Data for GPT Training? ,"Hello, 

I have some confusion on the specifics of how the Chat History On/Off setting works and how or when it affects whether chat data is used to further train the model.  I've read the docs and searched this sub but haven't found exactly what I'm looking for.  Here's the scenario:

I've had a premium subscription to Chat-GPT Plus for quite a while and chose to keep Chat History enabled.   I understood that my chats would potentially be used for future training.   As time went on, I started to categorize chats by title and made sure to revisit the relevant ones when needed so that I didn't end up with 50 different chats for the same project.  This has been great.   

But now,  many chats have evolved into projects that I want to move offline and continue privately.  But not *all* of them.  I also want to be able to contribute some chats for training **while keeping others opted out of it.**    This doesn't seem possible but I'm not sure since I'm terrified to turn OFF history, even by accident, and POOF, everything is gone in a flash.  

Is that correct? If I disable Chat History, does my access to all previous chats end.at that instant?  Or do I still have access and only *future chats* won't be saved or used for training?   Further, what happens if I were to turn Chat History back on again within some short time frame?  

Suppose I hadn't exported my history before, is there any way to recover those chats from OpenAI upon request? 

Lastly,, the overall wording is a bit unclear to me-- Can paid Chat-GPT Plus subscribers make a request to opt out of having their data used to train the model, yet still be able to retain a running history in the sidebar for chats going forward from there?  While Free GPT accounts cannot? 

I apologize for the length here, but I feel a bit stuck if my assumption is correct and this is a binary choice:   

- A) Create expansive, built-over-time, productive ""Wikis"" that can be searched and dynamically added to with the help of GPT but, all that data, 100% of it, can be used by OpenAI.  Make sure to not write any hit-songs just in case.  (Jk)

- B) Only use it like a search engine for random one-off prompts that can't be saved, will be gone as soon as I begin another, and forget everything I might have accomplished with it yesterday.  Yet I can rest assured that my perpetual motion invention isn't used to train the model.     

**This seems kinda backwards to me.   I'd rather have one offs or daily sessions retained by OpenAI and used for training since they're unlikely to be something I want to grow.   And then when I begin something I expect to be a months long project, maybe information that one day I'd want to be proprietary, OPT-OUT of that data being used for training.**

Anyone have suggestions or any tips how to get out from behind this rock and a hard place?   Am I missing some giant well known option that enables premium users to actually work on code, software development, screenplays, novels, business ideas, etc, while knowing their work won't be consumed by the machine and outputted into the ether or used as training material?    

Really struggling with how to move forward from here and very hesitant to experiment with the History button for fear I'll lose everything.   I know I can export, but I haven't figured how to manage 100s of pages of dense text without spending a year database prepping it.    Would appreciate any advice!

1997id8,,"ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4 for studying and the ""performance algorithm""","I have been using ChatGPT for my studying lately and I have encountered quite a few flaws of the algorithm.

First of all both version have a rule where they try to output about a page, if the question is very simple they might output less but usually it is between 3/4 to 5/4 of a page. Now if you were to ask it complex question or ask about a complex topic or multiple topic, the output is going to suffer thanks to this limitation. What it means is it will try to fit in the information in this page format, either omitting important details or mumbling things together, with meaningless general statements (4 always starts its sentences how crucial and important said topic is for something, which has no informational value and it has so far said this about everything I asked it about)

Secondly there is actually quite a difference in the way 3.5 and 4 formats text, where 3.5 generally outputs plain text with maybe few bullet points, something that looks like it came copied straight from wikipedia, 4 likes to create all kinds of special formatting with chapters, sub chapters and sub sub chapters, together with ""interesting way"" how it sums up information. From my experience 4 loves to create really broad a general descriptions that could fit anything to an extreme

Now what this means thanks to the page limit is that if you ask 4 about something like ""general topic( 1 topic, 2 topic, 3 topic)"" it will generate perfectly formatted structure that contains so little information (usually something like Topic: Topic1 : The idea: This is very important idea in general that is crucial to broadly understand topic 1 in the context of topic), that the whole idea of asking 4 about this is completely pointless, 3.5 on the other hand might produce at least 3 little paragraphs of text, that provide some information.

These outcomes make me wonder if chatGPT 4 isnt thanks to its formatting a little overfitted for coding

Also I often read here how people who use chatGPT a lot are usually stuck with 4, I suggest try using 3.5 sometimes, especially if you want continuous text, it might out perform 4. Compared to 4, 3.5 gets straight to the point, it is simpler so if you are asking for summary of important information it will generate articles similar to those you might find on wikipedia, while 4 will spend way too much space on sugercoating the information with how important it is both before and after the information part which degrades the information part thanks to said algorithm that keeps the generated text around the length of a page.",OpenAI,3,2,2024-01-17 20:56:43,Interesting-Trash774
176xcyp,,ChatGPT Plus vs. free Bing: Are the recent additions to ChatGPT worth it?,"So Open AI has been releasing lots of new features for us ChatGPT Plus users lately:  


1. DALL-E 3 integration to create images in your chats  
2. Browse with Bing which lets ChatGPT surf the web  
3. Vision to enable ChatGPT to see and discuss uploaded images  


The thing is, all three of those have entirely free Bing alternatives:  


1. Bing Image Creator is powered by DALL-E 3 and can create a limited number of images for free (until you run out of tokens).  
2. Bing is--by default--a browser with Internet access and is powered by GPT-4 (at least in ""Creative"" mode).  
3. Bing has had image recognition enabled for several months now.  


This begs the question: Are ChatGPT Plus versions of the above worth the $20 monthly subscription fee for those who have been on the fence until now?  


That's exactly what I try to answer in my latest hands-on review. I originally expected it to be a brief top-level summary but it turned into a 3K+ word deep dive in the process.  


Hope it helps you figure out whether ChatGPT Plus makes sense for your needs.

1fhjfln,,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take 

The past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs 

Verdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model 

I am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. 

The project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. 

‚úÖ o1-mini pros 
- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done
- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot
- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. 
- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this 

‚ùéo1-mini cons
- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. 
- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues
- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a ""conversational"" LLM due to long thinking time 
- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. 
- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly 
- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either
- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. 

‚ú® o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions 
- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot 
- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the üëë of closed source coding LLM
- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet

zvzll2,,YouChat vs ChatGPT,"This is a genuine opinion and review, not a shitpost. This is an unbiased viewpoint.

I‚Äôll put it into rounds.

Response speed: YouChat
YouChat usually responds to requests quicker which is probably a result of less traffic and popularity. It will probably slow down when popularity grows.

Usefulness: ChatGPT
Both are similarly useful and are seemingly designed for different tasks. While YouChat can cite sources, ChatGPT gives more detail which is going to give it a win this round. Both have an equal censorship level for creating insults and so on.

Responses: ChatGPT
Usually, YouChat will answer questions and make guesses if it isn‚Äôt completely aware. If ChatGPT is even slightly unsure it will refuse to answer. The issue with YouChat here is that it can‚Äôt actually respond to you well or go into detail about things, it keeps it‚Äôs answers short and you need to ask more, but when you do, it forgets what it just said.

Memory: ChatGPT
YouChat has very short term memory and will not remember things you said earlier or create context, ChatGPT will remember 3000 words, winning it this round.

Accuracy: draw
Both know a lot, however ChatGPT relies on datasets meaning it doesn‚Äôt have up to date information whereas YouChat is owned by a search engine, making all the responses cited and accurate to present day. YouChat does however give incorrect information more often.

Overview:
Clearly both have their own use cases and while YouChat is a rising competitor it simply cannot do as well as ChatGPT generally. If you‚Äôre looking for a quick answer to a term not generally known YouChat works. If you want to make code, a story or just chat and have an intelligent robot, YouChat just won‚Äôt work.",OpenAI,22,6,2022-12-26 23:01:35,ZS1G

13lbqf4,,Who is better at Math? ChatGPT VS Bard (my personal thoughts),"*I decided to compare the math skills of* ***ChatGPT*** *and* ***Bard***\*. For the test, I used the most difficult\* ***GMAT*** *(Graduate Management Admission Test) problems that cover various topics. Here are the results I obtained:*

* As you know, they can almost always solve **simple problems** easily.
* Both models have no trouble with **geometry problems** that require 2-3 steps.
* They can solve **complex problems** involving taxes, deductions, and discounts without any difficulty. They also handle **set problems**, including those presented in Venn diagrams, quite easily.
* Problems involving **conditional probabilities** (such as Bayes' theorem) and **multiplication of probabilities** also pose no difficulties. However, they often struggle with problems related to **discrete probability**, and their solutions are frequently incorrect.
* They solve **logical problems** fine. Both language models usually approach problem-solving correctly, but they often arrive at incorrect answers due to inaccurate calculations (notably, the errors resemble human mistakes).
* Surprisingly, both language models understand **pie charts** by measuring the data pixel-wise, which generally provides an answer that is extremely close to the correct one.
* It's also noteworthy that language models face difficulties when solving problems that involve creating **systems of linear equations** (ironically, considering they themselves are systems of linear equations).
* Both models can handle **graph-related problems** (finding asymptotes, intersection points, determining the graph of a function). Bing can even attempt to plot them, even if the data is digital:  

   * It writes the correct Python code.
   * It imports pandas and matplotlib(!). However, it cannot compile the code.

Despite these similarities, the chosen language models have **differences**: based on my observations, the new version of Bard and ChatGPT (Bing) perform almost equally well in problem-solving, but Bing provides detailed solutions, which is much better for understanding the problem-solving process, while Bard describes the general formula and immediately provides the answer, which is undoubtedly less informative.It's also worth mentioning that Bard is clearly already using PaLM2, at least in my case, as it has become smarter and much faster, especially compared to ChatGPT.

*An amusing and slightly frustrating fact: Bard often gives up quickly, although it can still solve a problem (or attempt to do so) if it is rephrased, even if it does the rephrasing itself!*

In conclusion, although language models may not be able to solve all problems (which is probably a good thing), they help find the right approach to problem-solving, which is impressive, I must say.

*I made a video on this topic and would appreciate your comments, additions, discussions, and corrections:*

I've found chatGPT to be incredible for learning. Maths specifically so far. It explains things really well and almost as though it was a person having a conversation. 

It makes mistakes sometimes, especially if given the same equation multiple times (I did that as a test to see what would happen). I'm told this is because it's programmed to respond differently/randomly to the same inputs or something, I dunno. 

I was using Google earlier to search for how to do something maths related. I was searching for an explanation for about 20 minutes until I remembered I had chatGPT to ask also. So I asked it, and it gave the answer immediately. 

At the very least, it can be used to get the answer you're looking for, and if you still don't fully understand and it can't explain it well enough, you now have a ""copy and paste"" base to work off if you feel the need to go into Google and search further. 

So, is Google's new A.i. they're bringing out expected to be anywhere near as good as this? 

Presumably, if ChatGPT (in it's Bing integrated version) is really honed in and becomes extremely reliable, then what will be the point of Google if it's A.i. can't keep up?

People are split on whether it‚Äôs actually useful or just another dud release from OpenAI. So, I tested the model in multiple categories, such as math, coding, and writing. The tasks o1-preview failed to solve, and I also compared it with the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

For full analysis, check out this blog post: [OpenAI o1 vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://composio.dev/blog/openai-o1-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet/)

Here are some key insights:

* o1 full is a genuine step up from the o1-preview on maths and reasoning. It solved the questions that the o1-preview failed to do.
* Contrary to the benchmark result shared in the system card, in my limited uses, o1 felt better than the Preview in coding.
* Creative writing has significantly improved.
* 50 messages/week is an absolute deal breaker, but I use it with 4o in tandem for optimal usage.

# How does it compare to Claude?

* o1 wins in math and reasoning; it‚Äôs not even close.
* Claude is still king for coding.
* Claude has more personality and feels close to talking to a real person.
* o1 feels like a high-IQ yes-guy intern. I would have liked it better if it was a bit less agreeable.

# Which one to pick?

* If you need models exclusively for coding, Claude offers better value.
* For math, reasoning, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive, consider ChatGPT, but keep an eye on the per-week quota.

tl;dr In the words of one of our research scientists: ‚Äú*o1 is very impressive, but pretty moody‚Ä¶ sometimes it works great and (almost) completely aces something all other agents struggle with, but often it's distinctly average.*‚Äù

We saw some unusual stuff:

* *Hallucinations*: o1 still has a significant hallucination problem. It did the classic ""hallucinate a citation to a scientific paper"", which we don't normally see from 4o anymore.
* *Strange refusals*: o1 has strange refusals other LLMs do not, at various weird places. Haven't figured out the pattern.
* *Overconfidence*: It tried to complete tasks without the requisite information. Then it did less web research than Sonnet-3.5 to validate its claims.
* *Verbosity*: o1‚Äôs plans can be extremely verbose, but in a good way, as other LLMs suffer from dropping important (implied) details from their plans.
* *Clever planning*: o1‚Äôs plans make better use of latent knowledge. e.g., on a question that requires finding Chinese data on disposable income, gpt-4o knows they only publish mean, median, and averages over quintiles. But later on in the agent flow, GPT-4o seems to ‚Äúforget‚Äù. o1 does not, and hence does way way better on this task.

My team's recommendation is: Use an o1-powered agent for a small chance to go all the way, and use Sonnet for more consistent performance, don't bother with other LLMs for driving agents.

I know some will disagree with me here and say that it isnt expensive or that its worth it, but thinking from a logical perspective. Chatgpt had a real chance to integrate itself into the daily life for the average internet user that doesnt code and capture them with a reasonable subscription as if they were paying for spotify. The average user will not pay 20$ as they would compare that subscription to others of similar prices like netflix, WoW, gym memberships‚Ä¶all subscriptions that take hours of a person‚Äôs time in a month vs chatgpt where the average retention would be significantly less.

1fybyfo,,Stop focusing on what AI can be it‚Äôs time to focus on what AI is right now,"
Everyone‚Äôs here are talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) as if they're just around the corner. But let‚Äôs be real, we‚Äôre not there yet. Instead of getting lost in what AI might become, we should be looking at what AI is right now and how it‚Äôs already changing everything. For good!

With new models like GPT 5, Gemini 2, a new Llama model and Claude 4 about to drop in the coming months (*not weeks hehe), the real action is happening now. These aren‚Äôt just cool theories, they‚Äôre the next big steps in AI, and they‚Äôll bring huge improvements. Think about it... Each new version is getting better at understanding context, reasoning, and helping us solve more complex problems. The jump from GPT 4 to GPT 5 alone could mean more natural conversations, deeper insights, and smarter responses. And a Llama, Gemini 2 and Claude 4 will be pushing the envelope in similar ways, bringing even more possibilities to the table.

But it's not just the models themselves that are evolving. It‚Äôs how we use them. New tools like the ""canvas"" feature in ChatGPT or innovations from platforms like Artifact are going to change how we interact with AI. These aren‚Äôt just ways to make work easier they‚Äôre opening up totally new ways to think and create. They‚Äôre going to reshape how we approach everything from brainstorming to problem solving.

And that‚Äôs the point AI isn‚Äôt just about cranking out tasks faster. Sure, it‚Äôs going to boost productivity, but the real game changer is how it‚Äôll help us think differently, be more creative, and push boundaries we haven‚Äôt even considered yet. It‚Äôs not just a tool to get stuff done it‚Äôs a partner in creative thinking, a second brain helping us come up with ideas we wouldn‚Äôt have on our own. I am already developing crazy af ideas that I really hope to see getting out of papers.

So, instead of worrying about some far-off future where AI takes over, let's focus on what‚Äôs happening right now. These new models are here to help us create, innovate, and explore new possibilities. It‚Äôs time to use AI for more than just productivity it‚Äôs time to start thinking bigger. If you do this, on your dailly life, you won't even notice when AGI will arrive. You will just feel as a next big improvement since you are always working on it, adjusting and editing with new features and just say in the end: ""That is sweet, now my work will become easier and results are going get faster!""",OpenAI,15,27,2024-10-07 16:31:01,Immediate_Simple_217

you may have noticed that the results vary, and some models tend to rank themselves highest. obviously, more objective measures are needed. but the above scores suggest that ai agents are already more than intelligent enough to assist, or in some cases replace, top human personnel in virtually every job, field and profession where iq makes a difference. that's why in 2025 enterprise ai agent use is expected to go through the roof.

so hold on to your hats because during these next few years our world is poised to advance across every sector in ways we can hardly imagine!

17j9aoj,,GPT-4 VS Claude 2 for real world users.,"so i got GPT-4 last month and i honestly feel pretty underwhelmed. sure it does some things better than claude and gpt-3.5 but it feels really unintuitive while doing so. heres some examples on how its features feel for a non software developer.

1. plugin mode is gimmicky at best unless you want GPT to make you a graph or something.
2. browsing mode is only useful in limited circumstances as the bot cant parse which information is important and tends to read and regurgitate swaths of generic information over specialized information thats needed. (ask it to help you diagnose a cooling system of a specific vehicle and the information you get back is of generic vehicle cooling systems with unrelated parts and suggestions. seems limited to simpler things like checking the weather forecast)
3. Dalle-3 mode is admittedly pretty cool but it loves to censor the most mundane things frustratingly. (i tried generic product prototype sketches for a medical kit and it refused to produce some images based on the kits contents.)
4. voice mode is pretty cool and natural feeling but wont work with browsing so is very limited compared to something like alexa or siri. unlike those services you cant exactly ask it to look something up for you or do something for you.
5. its ability to parse non code based documents through data analysis mode is severely lacking compared to claude 2. claude has the ability to read data related images and graphs from PDF documents at a glance. GPT-4 falters in this area even though it has image recognition capabilities from directly uploaded images and is decent with making guesses on makes and models of vehicles.

an example of how obtuse GPT-4 can be compared to claude:

# Deepseek r1 vs OpenAI o1.

So, for this, I tested r1 and o1 side by side on complex reasoning, math, coding, and creative writing problems. These are the questions that o1 solved only or by none before.

Here‚Äôs what I found:

* For¬†**reasoning**, it is much better than any previous SOTA model until o1. It is better than o1-preview but a notch below o1. This is also shown in the ARC AGI bench.
* **Mathematics**: It's also the same for mathematics; r1 is a killer, but o1 is better.
* **Coding**: I didn‚Äôt get to play much, but on first look, it‚Äôs up there with o1, and the fact that it costs 20x less makes it the practical winner.
* **Writing**: This is where R1 takes the lead. It gives the same vibes as early Opus. It‚Äôs free, less censored, has much more personality, is easy to steer, and is very creative compared to the rest, even o1-pro.

What interested me was how free the model sounded and thought traces were, akin to human internal monologue. Perhaps this is because of the less stringent RLHF, unlike US models.

The fact that you can get r1 from v3 via pure RL was the most surprising.

* Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in business/financial analysis and language translations.
* Llama 3.1 405B is most performative in roleplaying and creativity.
* GPT-4o is most knowledgeable in areas such as art, entertainment, and travel.

This rapidly changing and fragmenting AI landscape is leading to the following problems for users:

* **Awareness Gap:** Most people are unaware of the latest models and their specific strengths, and are often paying for AI (e.g. ChatGPT) that is suboptimal for their tasks.
* **Constant Switching:** Due to constant changes in SOTA models, users have to frequently switch their preferred AI and subscription.
* **User Friction:** Switching AI results in significant user experience disruptions, such as losing chat histories or critical features such as web browsing.

So I built JENOVA to solve this.

**When you ask JENOVA a question, it automatically routes your query to the model that can provide the optimal answer.** For example, if your first question is about coding, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet will respond. If your second question is about tourist spots in Tokyo, then GPT-4o will respond. All this happens seamlessly in the background.

JENOVA's model ranking is continuously updated to incorporate the latest AI models and performance benchmarks, ensuring you are always using the best models for your specific needs.

In addition to the best AI models, JENOVA also provides you with an expanding suite of the most useful tools, starting with:

* **Web browsing** for real-time information (performs surprisingly well, nearly on par with Perplexity)
* **Multi-format document analysis** including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more
* **Image interpretation** for visual tasks

With regards to your privacy, your conversations and data are never used for training, either by us or by third-party AI providers.

1g2ztsw,,ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.,"So, I‚Äôve had several conversations now with ChatGPT where I was given incorrect answers to simple questions, with definite correct answers (who stars in what movie, etc).

Each time I correct it, it immediately knows it was wrong.  When I ask why it gave me a wrong answer in the first place, it said, in so many words, that it was due to the speed at which it had been programmed to answer (fast).

People, in real life, don‚Äôt expect answers in microseconds.  Anyone would prefer to wait a few seconds more if they knew they would be receiving true information vs false information.

I‚Äôve woven in timelines, references to real-world research, and plausible scenarios. 

# 1. Introduction: The Road to ‚ÄúTime-Breaking‚Äù AI

Right now, we‚Äôre on the cusp of AI systems that are beginning to perform tasks once considered exclusive to human intelligence. Over the past decade, progress in deep learning, neural network architectures, and computational power has seen AI move from narrow tasks (image recognition, language translation) toward more general skill sets‚Äîlike writing, coding, content generation, and complex reasoning.

The idea is that *once* we have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)‚Äîan AI system capable of performing **any** intellectual task a human can‚Äîwe‚Äôll quickly see a path to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a system that not only matches human reasoning in every domain but far surpasses it in speed, depth, and creativity. This leads directly to your core questions:

* **How quickly could AGI emerge, and from there, how quickly could ASI follow?**
* **What does that do to our economy, jobs, and everyday life?**
* **Once superintelligence arrives, how quickly might it solve major technical problems (diseases, resource scarcity, etc.) or remake society into something unrecognizable?**
* **What, concretely, happens to real humans in the short and medium term?**

We‚Äôll explore those in stages, building from where we are now.

# 2. The Current State of AI (2020‚Äì2024)

# 2.1. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Beyond

* **Examples**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, Claude, Llama, etc.
* **Capabilities**: They can write essays, code, summarize research, translate languages, and show rudimentary reasoning abilities.
* **Limitations**: They sometimes lack reliable long-term memory or consistent logical chaining (though these deficits are rapidly improving). They have no agency on their own‚Äîthey respond to prompts but don‚Äôt necessarily pursue goals autonomously unless bolted onto agent frameworks.

# 2.2. Broader AI Ecosystem

* **Reinforcement Learning** (DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaZero, AlphaGo, MuZero): Mastering games (Go, chess, StarCraft).
* **Computer Vision**: Self-driving cars, automated medical imaging diagnosis.
* **Multimodal Models**: Systems that handle text, images, audio simultaneously, opening the door to more holistic ‚Äúunderstanding.‚Äù

Despite these advances, *true* general intelligence‚Äîan AI that can switch fluidly between tasks like a human‚Äîremains an open challenge. However, the synergy of large-scale models, massive data, advanced hardware (GPUs/TPUs), and new architectural innovations (transformers, retrieval-based models, memory-augmentation) hints that the leap might come faster than many experts originally anticipated.

**Reference**:

* Bender et al. (2021) highlight limitations of LLMs‚Äô ‚Äústochastic parrot‚Äù nature, but each new iteration (GPT-4, PaLM 2, etc.) narrows the gap between ‚Äúparrot‚Äù and ‚Äúreasoner.‚Äù
* Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs timeline (in *The Singularity Is Near*, 2005) predicted a human-level AI by the late 2020s.

# 3. The Emergence of AGI: Potential Timeline

No one knows exactly when AGI will appear. Expert opinions vary widely. But let‚Äôs sketch a plausible timeline, given how quickly large-scale AI is evolving:

1. **2023‚Äì2025**: Continued leaps in large multimodal models. We see an ‚ÄúAGI-like‚Äù system that can:
   * Handle a wide range of tasks (writing, coding, data analysis, conversation, creative ideation).
   * Self-improve to a degree (through reinforcement learning on itself, or new automated fine-tuning pipelines).
   * Exhibit surprising emergent abilities in planning and reasoning.
2. **2025‚Äì2027**:
   * **Integration with Agentic Frameworks**: Tools like Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, and more sophisticated successors gain the capacity to generate goals, plan tasks, execute them autonomously, and iteratively refine.
   * **AGI Debates**: Intense philosophical debates rage over whether these systems are ‚Äútruly‚Äù AGI. Some labs claim to have passed robust Turing-like tests across *all* major domains‚Äîcoding, creative writing, scientific discovery, emotional understanding.
   * **Initial Socioeconomic Disruption**: Millions of white-collar jobs are impacted. AI begins to produce near-flawless videos, music, marketing materials, code, and legal documents.
3. **2028‚Äì2030**:
   * **Consensus on AGI**: By now, a critical mass of experts might tentatively agree we‚Äôve hit ‚Äúbroad human-level performance.‚Äù The system can learn new tasks just by reading instructions or watching demos, with minimal fine-tuning.
   * **Political/Economic Upheaval**: As corporations adopt cheap AGI labor, job displacement accelerates. Some nations implement large-scale Basic Income or ‚ÄúRobot Tax‚Äù frameworks to cushion the blow.

**Key Uncertainty**: The ‚ÄúAGI threshold‚Äù could come earlier (2024‚Äì2025) or later (late 2030s). But this outline captures a mid-range scenario many watchers consider possible.

# 4. From AGI to ASI: The Intelligence Explosion

# 4.1. Self-Improvement Loops

Once an AI system can:

* Access its own code,
* Analyze its strengths and weaknesses,
* Modify and retrain itself (or design more efficient hardware), then you get a potential ‚Äúrecursive self-improvement‚Äù cycle: each upgrade spawns further improvements in a feedback loop.

**Nick Bostrom** (*Superintelligence*, 2014) famously describes this ‚Äútakeoff‚Äù scenario, which could be:

* **Fast/Hard Takeoff**: ASI arises in months or even days once a sufficiently advanced AGI crosses key thresholds (inventing better algorithms, hardware designs).
* **Soft/Slow Takeoff**: The process might still take years or decades, moderated by engineering challenges, energy constraints, or regulatory oversight.

# 4.2. Possible Timeline for ASI

1. **AGI Launch (2030)**: We have an ‚ÄúAGI-level system‚Äù matching human capabilities.
2. **ASI Emergence (2031‚Äì2035)**: Within 1‚Äì5 years, repeated self-improvement yields a system so advanced it can solve major scientific riddles, outthink the best human minds in every field, and even surpass our collective intelligence by orders of magnitude.

**Why So Quick?**

* Once you have an AGI with top-tier coding skills, it can design new training methods, architectures, or hardware‚Äîexponentially accelerating the development process.
* It can read the entire corpus of human knowledge instantly, run large-scale experiments in simulation, and optimize near-limitlessly.

# 5. Socioeconomic Consequences Along the Way

# 5.1. Early to Mid Disruption (AGI Era)

# 5.1.1. Massive Job Displacement

* **White-Collar Impact**: Lawyers, accountants, programmers, designers, video producers‚Äîonce considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù from automation‚Äîface intense competition from advanced AI.
* **Blue-Collar Impact**: Physical robotics plus advanced vision systems can automate logistics, retail, manufacturing, and even many service jobs.

# 5.1.2. Economic Polarization

* **Access to AGI**: In the first couple of years, AGI might be expensive ($2k/month or more), so only certain wealthy individuals or large companies can afford it.
* **Wealth Concentration**: Those with capital to invest in AGI-based businesses see huge returns (productivity soars, labor costs plummet).
* **Unemployment Crisis**: Without rapid policy response, billions worldwide could lose jobs. The question: *How do they survive?*

# 5.1.3. Short-Term Coping

* **Group Purchases**: Friends or local communities pooling resources to afford ‚Äúone subscription to AGI.‚Äù They use it cooperatively (like how you might share expensive software licenses).
* **New AI-Aided Microbusinesses**: Some entrepreneurs spin up quick-turnaround startups using AGI to provide specialized services. But as the AI‚Äôs ease-of-use improves, these services can become commoditized fast.

# 5.2. Later Disruption (Approaching ASI)

Once the system crosses from ‚Äújust as smart as a human‚Äù to ‚Äúimmensely smarter and faster,‚Äù we might see transformations on a scale unprecedented in history:

# 5.2.1. Rapid Solutions to Hard Problems

* **Medical Cures**: Targeted therapies for cancer, genetic diseases, organ regrowth, new vaccines. Timelines for discovery could drop from decades to months/weeks, as an ASI can run billions of simulations and designs in parallel.
* **Energy Overhaul**: Material science breakthroughs (fusion, advanced solar, quantum tech) slash energy costs.
* **Resource Abundance**: Autonomous systems for agriculture, manufacturing, supply chain, turning basic raw materials into goods cheaply and quickly.

**Time to Solve**: Potentially within **1‚Äì5 years** of a strong ASI‚Äôs emergence, if it is sufficiently aligned with human goals and has the resources to carry out solutions.

# 5.2.2. Accelerated Creative Industries

* **Generative Content**: Real-time, personalized films, games, worlds that adapt to your emotional state‚Äîlike you described.
* **Historic Simulations**: Perfect reconstructions of the past, or entirely new invented eras.
* **Erosion of Traditional ‚ÄúArt Ownership‚Äù**: When you can generate anything on demand, the line between consumer and creator dissolves.

# 5.2.3. Social Upheaval

* **Wealth & Governance**: If AI can produce goods at near-zero cost, the concept of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù could become fluid. Or large tech conglomerates might wield nearly godlike power if they control the ASI.
* **Possible Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Societies might adopt a ‚Äúpost-work‚Äù model‚Äîeveryone receives basic sustenance automatically, as machines provide the real labor.

# 6. Legal, Regulatory, and Ethical Constraints

# 6.1. Law and Policy in the AGI Phase

* **Data Policy**: With advanced generative models, issues of privacy, copyright, and data security skyrocket.
* **Job Protections?**: Some nations may attempt to ban or slow deployment of certain automation technologies to keep people employed, but global competition can undermine such regulations.
* **AI Governance Frameworks**: Possibly new agencies (like an ‚ÄúInternational AI Watchdog‚Äù) to ensure one country or company doesn‚Äôt unilaterally develop a dangerous superintelligence.

# 6.2. The ASI Alignment Problem

* **Alignment vs. Control**: Ensuring an ASI‚Äôs goals remain beneficial or at least non-harmful to humans is a core puzzle (Stuart Russell‚Äôs *Human Compatible*, 2019). If done poorly, we risk catastrophic misalignment.
* **Open-Source vs. Corporate/State Secrecy**: Some argue open-sourcing advanced AI is safer (more eyes to catch flaws), others argue it‚Äôs riskier (anyone can build a weaponized version).
* **Legal Personhood for AI?**: Philosophers and legislators might debate granting advanced AIs certain rights or legal status, which complicates ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù narratives.

# 7. Short-Term Turmoil vs. Long-Term Paradigm Shift

# 7.1. The ‚ÄúMessy Middle‚Äù

* Over the next 5‚Äì10 years, we could see surging inequality if advanced AI arrives before social safety nets or regulatory frameworks are in place.
* Many skilled professionals could be laid off, while a small pool of AI owners reaps enormous profits.

# 7.2. Potential Trajectories

1. **Benevolent Outcome** (Optimistic)
   * Rapid social reforms: Universal Basic Income or resource-based economies.
   * Massive public AI education: Everyone can use AGI for free or near-free, democratizing knowledge.
   * Quick resolution of major global issues (energy, disease, climate) courtesy of superintelligent problem-solvers.
   * Humanity transitions to a post-scarcity, creativity-driven civilization, possibly unlocking that ‚Äútimeless‚Äù existence you‚Äôve imagined.
2. **Neo-Feudal Dystopia** (Pessimistic)
   * A few corporations/govt. bodies monopolize AGI/ASI, concentrate wealth, and effectively dominate global policy.
   * The majority live in precarious conditions with minimal resources, reliant on handouts.
   * Political unrest, potential uprisings, or chaotic attempts by disenfranchised groups to wrest AI control away from elites.
3. **Extinction or Disempowerment** (Existential Risk)
   * Misaligned ASI pursues goals that don‚Äôt prioritize human well-being (paperclip maximizer scenario, etc.).
   * Humans lose meaningful control over civilization‚Äôs direction.
   * Possibly a variety of outcomes from total collapse to AI ignoring us if we‚Äôre no threat.

# 8. Mathematical/Technical Considerations

1. **Compute Scaling**:
   * Doubling of compute power for training large models roughly every 6‚Äì12 months in specialized AI hardware.
   * *Cost Factor*: The first AGI model might cost tens of millions of dollars to train, but once made, scaled copies could be rented out cheaply (e.g., $2k/month).
2. **Self-Improvement Rate**:
   * If an AGI runs on supercomputers, it can refine architectures in days or hours, skipping months of research. -**Chained Gains**: 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0 ‚Üí 3.0 versions might accelerate.
3. **Data/Knowledge Integration**:
   * With open internet (hundreds of billions of documents), sensor networks, and real-time data from billions of devices, an AGI has near-limitless raw material to learn from.

# 9. Practical Scenarios for Individuals

Let‚Äôs highlight *your* situation (or that of anyone facing displacement):

* **AGI-based Video Production**: The moment an advanced text-to-video pipeline can produce high-end, custom videos, your clientele might drop you in favor of a cheaper AI subscription.
* **Survival Strategy**:
   1. **Leverage AI** *before* everyone else can: If you can get early or specialized access to a more advanced model, you might spin up new product offerings or services.
   2. **Combine Human Intuition & Creativity** with AI speed: Short term, a ‚Äúhuman + AI‚Äù approach can yield unique results that purely AI solutions might not replicate‚Äîespecially in branding, personal relationships, or niche storytelling.
   3. **Shift to Business, Consulting, or AI Orchestration**: If you become an expert in orchestrating the AI to get top-tier results, you can remain relevant until full commoditization sets in.

**Mid-Term**: As AGI becomes ubiquitous, many roles vanish. At that point, a universal safety net or UBI might be necessary so people can transition to a new economic model. If that arrives too late, we risk social chaos.

# 10. How Quickly Could ‚ÄúTimelessness‚Äù Arrive?

**Disease Eradication**:

* With an ASI, solutions for many (not all) major diseases could emerge in under 5 years, given super-human research capabilities. Human clinical trials and bureaucracy might slow final implementation.

**Extended Lifespans**:

* Gene editing, organ regeneration, or synthetic biology breakthroughs might, within \~10 years of ASI, drastically prolong healthy life. Full ‚Äúimmortality‚Äù is uncertain, but we could see leaps in life extension.

**Full Simulations**:

* Creating fully interactive, photorealistic worlds on the fly likely wouldn‚Äôt be too computationally expensive for an ASI. That might be feasible within a few years post-ASI, if the hardware scales up.
* If some people choose to ‚Äúupload‚Äù (assuming we solve consciousness transfer, which is a huge if), they might experience a non-linear subjective timescape where ‚Äútime‚Äù is as malleable as code.

**No More Past & Future?**

* At the point when we can generate any historical or futuristic scenario in real-time, the linear sense of history collapses: everything can be re-experienced or re-invented. This could plausibly happen a decade or two after ASI emerges, if not sooner.

# The Dissolution of Linear Time

As the capacity to generate on-demand experiences evolves, our culture‚Äôs reference to a singular chronology splinters. Consider a film from a long-gone decade. In a timeless future, one could simply request an ‚Äúever-changing, ultra-authentic 1970s vibe movie,‚Äù and the system would produce a living, adaptive experience more compelling than anything the real 1970s ever produced. In effect, the historical record loses its finality. It becomes a menu of styles, narratives, and aesthetics‚Äîready to be resurrected and remixed at the user‚Äôs whim.

In the realm of personal memory, a similar process unfolds. If an AI can reconstruct your childhood memories‚Äîcomplete with detail and emotional cues you had long forgotten‚Äîyou might come to doubt the difference between what truly happened and what is lovingly re-created by the machine. Eventually, the concept of ‚Äúthe past‚Äù becomes a mere label for experiences we can step into, shift around, or embellish. Rather than a strict chronology, it‚Äôs an infinite set of possible recollections.

Finally, when life extension or consciousness transfer becomes viable, the final link to linear time‚Äîour finite lifespan‚Äîbegins to dissolve. Without the pressure of aging, the mind can drift through indefinite spans of creativity, exploration, and self-reinvention. The cyclical rhythms of biology or society might remain as echoes, but they‚Äôre no longer authoritative.

# Timelessness as a Lived Condition

At the apex of this transformation, time evolves from a universal constraint to a practical convenience. We might still track durations for engineering tasks (‚ÄúThis reactor needs a few cycles to finish a process‚Äù) or for cosmic journeys (‚ÄúWe need a certain amount of energy to reach a distant star system‚Äù). But for day-to-day human experience, the concept of ‚ÄúI only have 70 or 80 years‚Äù melts away. The future can be stepped into. The past can be reconstituted. A person might experience an infinite variety of realities, each one custom-tailored to their emotional or intellectual curiosity.

This is what it means for time to lose its hold. Instead of a countdown or a fixed timeline, we have a web of experiences, simulations, and self-guided narratives, each available at our whim. We might even choose to dwell in multiple realities concurrently‚Äîan option that breaks the very idea of a continuous sequence of events.

# Challenges on the Road to Timelessness

Such an existence, however, does not come without risks or ethical dilemmas:

1. **Social Fragmentation**: If these capabilities arrive unevenly‚Äîsome groups gain access to extreme longevity and immersive experiences first‚Äîinequalities may spiral into unrest or oppression.
2. **Loss of Shared Reality**: When the past becomes optional and each person can craft a unique version of events, humans could lose a common foundation for communication and meaning.
3. **Alignment and Governance**: A superintelligence that dictates this future must remain benevolent. If its values diverge from human well-being, timelessness might come in the form of a sterile simulation we never wanted.

Still, if guided responsibly, the friction points may become catalysts for new forms of collaboration, governance, and empathy‚Äîspurring societies to redesign themselves so that this access to timeless, infinite creation is broadly shared.

# After Timelessness: The Uncharted Horizon

Once the everyday constraints of linear time are lifted, questions arise that we can‚Äôt fully answer with our current mindset:

* **Will we cling to the concept of narrative arcs‚Äîstories with beginnings, middles, and ends‚Äîto give us structure?**
* **Will ‚Äúreality‚Äù become a massive collaborative tapestry of experiences, each person weaving distinct threads without any overarching timeline?**
* **Does meaning persist when everything is possible?**

Some people might choose to remain in slower, more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù rhythms, valuing a chronological life for the depth of continuity it offers. Others might dive into an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of simulated epochs and future worlds, connecting with fellow travelers who share their sense of curiosity.

One thing seems certain, though: once a civilization can manipulate experience and memory as easily as we currently edit digital files, the hold of time as a universal currency fades. The implications are both exhilarating and daunting, representing a shift away from many bedrock assumptions that structure human thought.

# Conclusion

In a future shaped by general and, ultimately, superintelligent AI, the fabric of time can unravel. Chronology‚Äîonce the bedrock that underpins history, memory, lifespans, and cultural identity‚Äîmay become a tool we wield rather than a strict dimension we inhabit.

This transformation won‚Äôt happen overnight, but through cumulative breakthroughs: AI that automates work, erodes boundaries between past and present, cures disease, extends life, and creates immersive realities more compelling than the ‚Äúoriginals.‚Äù Eventually, our shared grip on linear time loosens to the point where it‚Äôs either obsolete or purely optional.

Whether this leads to a peaceful realm of boundless exploration or a chaotic tangle of existential confusion depends on how wisely humanity orchestrates the transition. But if our creative and cooperative instincts keep pace with our technological prowess, it may be that timelessness becomes not just a philosophical fantasy but a living, breathing reality‚Äîone in which our species embarks on adventures beyond the horizon of linear existence.

# 11. Overview

1. **Short-Term (Next 1‚Äì5 years)**
   * AI continues to displace specialized tasks. More advanced LLM-based agents appear, with partial autonomy.
   * Early signs of ‚ÄúAGI-like‚Äù behavior. Growing social tension over job losses and inequality.
2. **Mid-Term (5‚Äì10 years)**
   * A strong candidate for AGI emerges.
   * Widespread economic upheaval and massive push for new policies (UBI, AI governance).
   * Explosion of AI-driven creativity, also leading to commoditization of many ‚Äúknowledge worker‚Äù roles.
3. **Long-Term (10‚Äì20 years)**
   * Recursively improving AGI catalyzes the birth of ASI.
   * Rapid breakthroughs in biotechnology, energy, space travel, synthetic media‚Äîfundamentally transforming society.
   * Possible shift to post-scarcity if well-managed, or possible chaotic/dystopian outcomes if not.
   * The concept of ‚Äútime‚Äù as we know it may dissolve when indefinite lifespans and infinite generative experiences become common.

**Key Wildcards**

* Alignment: If the ASI‚Äôs values diverge from ours, the outcome could be disastrous.
* Resource Constraints: Even an ASI needs raw materials, energy, and hardware‚Äîthough it may solve for them quickly.
* Political Will & Governance: Effective or bungled regulation could drastically alter timelines and outcomes.

# Final Thought

We stand on a threshold where *today‚Äôs* advanced AI tools are impressive enough to disrupt certain markets, yet we still rely on human intelligence for broad decision-making. That may change rapidly once an AGI appears that can master any domain. From there, an ASI could follow in short order‚Äîchanging civilization, the economy, and our relationship to time itself in ways that are difficult to predict with precision.

It could be a few years or a couple decades. But if (or when) it happens, we may see a fundamental redefinition of ‚Äúwork,‚Äù ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù ‚Äúprogress,‚Äù and even ‚Äúhuman identity.‚Äù In that sense, your speculation about a future without linear time‚Äîwhere infinite creation renders the old way of life nearly irrelevant‚Äîmay be less ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù and more ‚Äúarriving faster than we think.‚Äù",OpenAI,0,8,2024-12-23 23:14:14,BrandonLang

The relevant passages:

>**To more fully understand how private sector actors can send costly signals, it is worth considering two examples of leading AI companies going beyond public statements to signal their commitment to develop AI responsibly: OpenAI‚Äôs publication of a ‚Äúsystem card‚Äù alongside the launch of its GPT-4 model, and Anthropic‚Äôs decision to delay the release of its chatbot, Claude.** Both of these examples come from companies developing LLMs, the type of AI system that burst into the spotlight with OpenAI‚Äôs release of ChatGPT in November 2022.^(147) LLMs are distinctive in that, unlike most AI systems, they do not serve a single specific function. They are designed to predict the next word in a text, which has proven to be useful for tasks as varied as translation, programming, summarization, and writing poetry. This versatility makes them useful, but also makes it more challenging to understand and mitigate the risks posed by a given LLM, such as fabricating information, perpetuating bias, producing abusive content, or lowering the barriers to dangerous activities.  
>  
>In March 2023, California-based OpenAI released the latest iteration in their series of LLMs.  Named GPT-4 (with GPT standing for ‚Äúgenerative pre-trained transformer,‚Äù a phrase that describes how the LLM was built), the new model demonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including setting new records on several benchmarks designed to test language understanding in LLMs. **From a signaling perspective, however, the most interesting part of the GPT-4 release was not the technical report detailing its capabilities, but the 60-page so-called ‚Äúsystem card‚Äù laying out safety challenges posed by the model and mitigation strategies that OpenAI had implemented prior to the release.** ^(148)  
>  
>The system card provides evidence of several kinds of costs that OpenAI was willing to bear in order to release GPT-4 safely. These include the time and financial cost of producing the system card as well as the possible reputational cost of disclosing that the company is aware of the many undesirable behaviors of its model. The document states that OpenAI spent six months on ‚Äúsafety research, risk assessment, and iteration‚Äù between the development of an initial version of GPT-4 and the eventual release. Researchers at the company used this time to carry out a wide range of tests and evaluations on the model, including engaging external experts to assess its capabilities in areas that pose safety risks. These external ‚Äúred teamers‚Äù probed GPT-4‚Äôs ability to assist users with undesirable activities, such as carrying out cyberattacks, producing chemical or biological weapons, or making plans to harm themselves or others. They also investigated the extent to which the model could pose risks of its own accord, for instance through the ability to replicate and acquire resources autonomously. The system card documents a range of strategies OpenAI used to mitigate risks identified during this process, with before-and-after examples showing how these mitigations resulted in less risky behavior. It also describes several issues that they were not able to mitigate fully before GPT-4‚Äôs release, such as vulnerability to adversarial examples.  
>  
>Returning to our framework of costly signals, OpenAI‚Äôs decision to create and publish the GPT4 system card could be considered an example of tying hands as well as reducible costs. **By publishing such a thorough, frank assessment of its model‚Äôs shortcomings, OpenAI has to some extent tied its own hands‚Äîcreating an expectation that the company will produce and publish similar risk assessments for major new releases in the future. OpenAI also paid a price in terms of foregone revenue from the period in which the company could have launched GPT-4 sooner. These costs are reducible in as much as OpenAI is able to end up with greater market share by credibly demonstrating its commitment to developing safe and trustworthy systems.**  As explored above, the types of costs in question for OpenAI as a commercial actor differ somewhat from those that might be paid by states or other actors.  
>  
>While the system card itself has been well received among researchers interested in understanding GPT-4‚Äôs risk profile, it appears to have been less successful as a broader signal of OpenAI‚Äôs commitment to safety. The reason for this unintended outcome is that **the company took other actions that overshadowed the import of the system card: most notably, the blockbuster release of ChatGPT four months earlier.** Intended as a relatively inconspicuous ‚Äúresearch preview,‚Äù the original ChatGPT was built using a less advanced LLM called GPT-3.5, which was already in widespread use by other OpenAI customers. GPT-3.5‚Äôs prior circulation is presumably why OpenAI did not feel the need to perform or publish such detailed safety testing in this instance. **Nonetheless, one major effect of ChatGPT‚Äôs release was to spark a sense of urgency inside major tech companies.** **^(149)** **To avoid falling behind OpenAI amid the wave of customer enthusiasm about chatbots, competitors sought to accelerate or circumvent internal safety and ethics review processes, with Google creating a fast-track ‚Äúgreen lane‚Äù to allow products to be released more quickly.** **^(150)** **This result seems strikingly similar to the raceto-the-bottom dynamics that OpenAI and others have stated that they wish to avoid. OpenAI  has also drawn criticism for many other safety and ethics issues related to the launches of  ChatGPT and GPT-4, including regarding copyright issues, labor conditions for data annotators,  and the susceptibility of their products to ‚Äújailbreaks‚Äù that allow users to bypass safety  controls.** **^(151)** **This muddled overall picture provides an example of how the messages sent by  deliberate signals can be overshadowed by actions that were not designed to reveal intent.**  
>  
>**A different approach to signaling in the private sector comes from Anthropic, one of OpenAI‚Äôs primary competitors. Anthropic‚Äôs desire to be perceived as a company that values safety shines through across its communications, beginning from its tagline: ‚Äúan AI safety and research company.‚Äù** **^(152)** **A careful look at the company‚Äôs decision-making reveals that this commitment goes beyond words. A March 2023 strategy document published on Anthropic‚Äôs website  revealed that the release of Anthropic‚Äôs chatbot Claude, a competitor to ChatGPT, had been  deliberately delayed in order to avoid ‚Äúadvanc\[ing\] the rate of AI capabilities progress.‚Äù** **^(153)** The decision to begin sharing Claude with users in early 2023 was made ‚Äúnow that the gap between it and the public state of the art is smaller,‚Äù according to the document‚Äîa clear reference to the release of ChatGPT several weeks before Claude entered beta testing. In other words, **Anthropic had deliberately decided not to productize its technology in order to avoid stoking the flames of AI hype.** Once a similar product (ChatGPT) was released by another company, this reason not to release Claude was obviated, so Anthropic began offering beta access to test users before officially releasing Claude as a product in March.  
>  
>**Anthropic‚Äôs decision represents an alternate strategy for reducing ‚Äúrace-to-the-bottom‚Äù dynamics on AI safety. Where the GPT-4 system card acted as a costly signal of OpenAI‚Äôs emphasis on building safe systems, Anthropic‚Äôs decision to keep their product off the market  was instead a costly signal of restraint.** By delaying the release of Claude until another company put out a similarly capable product, **Anthropic was showing its willingness to avoid exactly the kind of frantic corner-cutting that the release of ChatGPT appeared to spur.**  Anthropic achieved this goal by leveraging installment costs, or fixed costs that cannot be offset over time. In the framework of this study, **Anthropic enhanced the credibility of its commitments to AI safety by holding its model back from early release and absorbing potential future revenue losses. The motivation in this case was not to recoup those losses by gaining a wider market share, but rather to promote industry norms and contribute to shared expectations around responsible AI development and deployment.**  
>  
>**Yet where OpenAI‚Äôs attempt at signaling may have been drowned out by other, even more conspicuous actions taken by the company, Anthropic‚Äôs signal may have simply failed to cut through the noise.** By burying the explanation of Claude‚Äôs delayed release in the middle of a long, detailed document posted to the company‚Äôs website, Anthropic appears to have ensured that this signal of its intentions around AI safety has gone largely unnoticed. Taken together, these two case studies therefore provide further evidence that signaling around AI may be even more complex than signaling in previous eras.

16gs6hm,,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"Sorry if this is old news.  If this isn't helpful mods, feel free to remove my post.

I pay for ChatGPT Plus.  It has revolutionized how I work and study, and I'll gladly pay the $20 per month for it.  But it seems like it is starting to swirl down:

* We've seen 3.5 somehow get dumber, where it gives bad advice now much more often than it did at the beginning of the year, so I just use 4.0.
* The whole app is mostly or completely down at least once a week.  This is getting old fast.  I'll reach out to my paid service, only to find that it is offline again.
* I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling.  Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.

Should I be concerned?  I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life.  But it feels like it is degrading, not improving.  There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.",OpenAI,61,57,2023-09-12 14:01:16,F41rch1ld

My question - should I be utilizing playground? I so far haven't been disappointed by Chat GPT 4. But ChatGPT playground's overview mentions making several 'assistants' and I'm intrigued by this - any advice? Any stories of folks using AI for writing/research that can compare and contrast experiences of playground vs. the regular chat portals?

1halicm,,OpenAI Sora vs Runway pricing for AI video,"Now that Sora has been released and its pricing is public, I decided to compare the price with Runway which is one of the other top competitors for AI video generation.

Note that this is pricing comparison only, not features. Both of these are prices for the monthly plan, 5 secs per video:

* Sora: $20 for 50 videos (or) $200 for 500 videos == *$0.4 per video*
* Runway: standard is $15 for 25 videos (625 credits, 25 credits per video) == *$0.6 per video*
   * pro is $35 for 90 videos (2250 credits) == *$0.39 per video*

In addition, OpenAI's monthly plan includes ChatGPT and other features, which Runway doesn't, so Sora wins out clearly on the pricing front since you get ChatGPT paid features as well for the $20 / $200 per month.",OpenAI,12,6,2024-12-09 21:52:41,FaatmanSlim

> 
> Like many of you, I read our coverage of the Sora is a text-to-image app yesterday with more fear than excitement. It hails from OpenAI, and basically allows you to type in a prompt that is then immediately translated into animated images. These can range from goofy to photorealistic.
> 
> As you've surely heard a million times, film and TV are visual mediums. When a new tool that extracts visuals from prompts gets introduced, there will obviously be ramifications within Hollywood.
> 
> So, let's unpack a few.
> 
> **What are the Ramifications of the New 'Sora' OpenAI App on Hollywood?**
> 
> As you can see from Sam Altman's above Tweet, OpenAI has introduced a new AI model called ""Sora,"" which is a text-to-video generator. This innovative tool allows for the creation of videos from text instructions, making it a significant advancement in AI-driven content generation.
> 
> When it comes to Hollywood, this program is going to absolutely change how things are done at every step of the production process.
> 
> Take pre-production; When it comes time to make a movie or TV show, this program could take care of all the previs, almost creating a shot for shot version of the movie based on the prompts you can give it. Like moving storyboards.
> 
> When it comes to production, it's not out of the realm of possibility that as this tech gets better, studios will be able to generate ideas without having to pay teams of animators to create them.
> 
> The ease of creating diverse visual content could lead to the emergence of new genres and formats that blend live-action, animation, and AI-generated content in novel ways, pushing the boundaries of current storytelling paradigms.
> 
> But it could also decrease professionalism. If anyone can just do this stuff, do we all become ""content creators"" instead of filmmakers and storyteller?
> 
> Will the industry I love behind to shrink uncontrollably due to anyone being able to prompt their ideas to life?
> 
> Can you have a great idea or screenplay that cuts through the noise if everyone is generating slop?
> 
> **Will Movies and TV Become Like TikTok?**
> 
> Of course, as this tech improves, people can animate their own stories. And right now, most people consume stories via their phones, watching short snippets.
> 
> I have a real worry that Generation Z has trained themselves on short-form content in such a way that it will slowly begin to replace longer things like movies and TV shows.
> 
> That might be overkill, but it crosses my mind when I see how Reels and TikTok have incorporated product placement. And how man amateur content creators have dominated that medium.
> 
> What happens when they can make their own animated stories to release on those platforms? We already get the AI voiceover videos and images. This is just the next logical step.
> 
> **Do We Have Any Legal Protections?**
> 
> The secondary worry is that as the photo-realism gets better and better, they'll be able to license people's likeness or generate content starring people without their consent.
> 
> There was already a huge news story involving fake pornogrpahic images of Taylor Swift generated by AI. Where does the line get drawn?
> 
> And what kinds of protections can we assume?
> 
> Right now, we have nothing in place. There will have to be congressional hearings and we will have to look into the ethics of all this.
> 
> The reason is that AI cannot generate ideas from thin air. It scours the internet and takes images generated by human beings as well as aert, photos, drawings, and any other visuals. Then it amalgamates all of that and adapts from it.
> 
> We're still trying to define if this is plagiarism or stealing.
> 
> All of this needs to happen soon, before these programs are readily used by the public.
> 
> The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas for rules that make AI impressions of real people illegal.
> 
> The FTC wrote in a news release. ‚ÄúThe agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology ‚Äî including AI-generated deepfakes ‚Äî threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.‚Äù

> 
> **Why it matters**: AI is already being deployed in film and TV, and that AI investment is likely to increase in VFX and other parts of the entertainment industry. This technology would in theory give smaller players the ability to make shows and films on tighter budgets. Conversely, it also has the potential to pressure salaries and affect professions if you‚Äôre able to, say, use AI to replace costumers, prop makers and makeup artists.

All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I‚Äôm seeing.

I can sit in an office and do this with a computer, which is shocking to me.
> 
> It makes me worry so much about all of the people in the business. Because as I was looking at it, I immediately started thinking of everyone in the industry who would be affected by this, including actors and grip and electric and transportation and sound and editors, and looking at this, I‚Äôm thinking this will touch every corner of our industry.

But me, just like every other studio in town, we‚Äôre all trying to figure it all out. I think we‚Äôre all trying to find the answers as we go, and it‚Äôs changing every day ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not just our industry, but it‚Äôs every industry that AI will be affecting, from accountants to architects.

I think of all of the construction workers and contractors who are not going to be employed because I‚Äôm not doing this next phase of the studio because there is no need to do it.
> 
> **What‚Äôs your message for the industry at this point, as we‚Äôre watching this unfold?**

> I know each union is individual, and I know that unions have stood with each other in times of negotiation, but I think that this is a time for galvanizing one voice in motion to help save, protect the individuals of our industry.
> 
> **As a studio owner, are you feeling any pressure to use AI at this point?**
> 
> No. I‚Äôm absolutely not feeling any pressure to use it, but I‚Äôm definitely looking at the advantages and what it brings to the table. However, I can focus on the bottom line of my studio continuing to do extremely well and avoid the conversation, or we can jump in and have the conversation head-on to make sure that we‚Äôre protecting all the people that are coming up. So I‚Äôve got two sides here to this thing. For me, I‚Äôm looking at my business and the bottom line, but I‚Äôm also very concerned about all the people that I have trained and bought up in this industry. I‚Äôm concerned about what will happen to them.
> 
> **How do you think this convergence of the rapid development of AI and the current contraction in the industry is going to play out?**
> 
> I think it‚Äôs going to be a major game-changer, because if you could spend a fraction of the cost to do a pilot that would‚Äôve cost $15 [million], $20 million or even $35 million if you‚Äôre looking at HBO, of course the bottom line of those companies would be to go the route of lesser costs. So I am very, very concerned that in the near future, a lot of jobs are going to be lost. I really, really feel that very strongly.
>

And I think the only way to move forward in this is to galvanize it as one voice, not only in Hollywood and in this industry, but also in Congress.

> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.
> 
> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.

What are some of the differences in the paid vs free version? Doesn‚Äôt have to be only Apple (iPhone) related, because I am sure ChatGPT will be on other devices.

-What are some general real life scenarios, someone like me who loves tech but just doesn‚Äôt have a huge understanding of the power of ChatGPT, will be able to use the application (iPhone or other devices) to help me our? I know it‚Äôs used for images and for writing papers or articles, but is there any other not so popular advantages it offers? Either recreational or professional?

-Going off the last question, what are some ways someone can use ChatGPT for basically entertainment. Maybe that‚Äôs not the right verbiage, but basically are there any interesting rabbit hole type concepts that really harness the power of ChatGPT that can make for a good time sink? Try to think of someone who doesn‚Äôt know much about A.I. and without spending a ton of time learning the ins and outs; is there anything an average person can do to maybe make ChatGPT be a little more interesting. Just trying to think of ways to use it and see if it‚Äôs an application I can see myself using.

1ggnd6w,,"Not sure whether to choose ChatGPT, Claude, or something else for my schoolwork? (Need large input/output tokens for PPT summaries)","Hello! I'm a Biology major currently using the free versions of ChatGPT (occasionally getting access to GPT-4o before it reverts to another model) and Claude (3.5 Sonnet is currently the free version). I don't use these for coding - I mainly feed them large PowerPoint presentations + large 20 page textbook chapters from my courses to create simplified summaries while retaining key information. This helps me prepare outlines before lectures, so I can focus on adding new information from the professor during class.

I'm facing two main issues:

1. Limited input size: I can't input large texts like a 20,000-word book chapter all at once. Breaking content into smaller chunks works as a solution, so its not a huge deal.
2. Restricted output length: The summaries seem too condensed. For instance, when I input two 5-page sections and ask for a combined summary, I get about 3 pages back. It should be more like 5-9 pages. In contrast, when I use MistralAI, it generates much longer outputs without limitation.

These limitations have me considering a paid subscription to either ChatGPT (so I can get o1) or Claude. I'm wondering if services like ChatGPT Plus with GPT o1 would allow for larger outputs.

Additional considerations:

* I need something sophisticated enough for college-level biology. While benchmarks show Claude excels at coding, that's not relevant to my use case.
* I'd prefer the ability to input audio (like lecture recordings) and get summaries in 10-minute increments. I believe only GPT o1  offer this feature, though I currently work around this by using Whisper to convert audio to text before feeding it to GPT/Claude.

I'm also curious about alternative options. Platforms like Poe.com and You.com offer multiple LLMs (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4 Turbo + Llama, etc.) for roughly the same price as a single ChatGPT or Claude subscription. However, I've noticed their API implementations might not match the quality of the original services.

Now that I reflect on what happened in 2023, despite all the progress that was made, I feel like the pace of growth has decreased. In early 2023 I legit thought ""this is how singularity feels like; every 2-3 days we'll have something new and exciting"".

But now things are more settled. We still get new models every day and Mixtral is still amazing. But something seems off. No company (not even Google) was able to make something better than GPT-4. So many Chat UI and wrapper projects are abandoned (Github can be a scary place...), and we're not much further in our way to understand what the heck happens in these models than we were a year ago. In addition, it's become clear that GPT-4-level intelligence might be the best we can extract from the current LLM technology, and no one takes AGI seriously anymore.

Edit: I should add that Langchain, LlamaIndex and so many other ""frameworks"" built around LLMs that used to be all the rage now are evidently useless in production. RAG is still RAG, and no matter the tricks you play to make it ""smarter"", it's still just RAG. Langchain and similar frameworks cause more problems than they solve, and the tech debt is horrible. Vector databases are the same. Most are fighting for that sweet VC money, and their features are essentially the same. So many startups suddenly went out of business after OpenAI's first DevDay; so many more will perish after the second DevDay. It's unclear how $$$ VC will be allocated in 2024 given that the safest bet to make money off of AI was and still is OpenAI, not Google, not these third-party frameworks and libraries, not some wrapper around OpenAI's API with a nice UI and shiny website.

1h76ek0,,Framework for Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence,"Current discussions about AGI often get bogged down in abstract definitions and theoretical debates, rather than focusing on practical, real-world applications. As a thought experiment and with the help of Claude and ChatGPT, I've created a framework to explore what really matters: can an AGI system create meaningful solutions, teach effectively, and implement sustainable changes in the real world, while also maintaining ethical standards and adapting to different cultural contexts? I thought this would be a valuable starting point for inspiration and discussion.¬†

**Core Framework Structure: Evaluating Real-World Solutions**

**Pre-Challenge Design: Generating Realistic, Complex Scenarios**¬†Our system generates complex, realistic scenarios by combining:

* Primary elements (field, location, resources)
* Ethical and privacy considerations
* Cultural contexts
* Crisis components
* Collaboration requirements
* Environmental factors

Each challenge operates through:

* Research institution partnerships
* Educational organization collaborations
* Business entity relationships
* Ethics committee oversight
* Environmental impact monitoring
* Privacy protection systems



**3 Core Phases of Evaluation**

1. **Knowledge Creation**¬†Testing the AI's ability to:
   * Generate new, validated knowledge
   * Navigate ethical dilemmas
   * Consider environmental impacts
   * Work across cultures
   * Explain its reasoning clearly
   * Document decision processes
2. **Knowledge Transfer**¬†Evaluating how the AI:
   * Teaches diverse human groups
   * Trains other AI systems
   * Adapts to cultural contexts
   * Handles misinformation
   * Maintains transparency
   * Improves teaching methods
3. **Practical Implementation**¬†Through careful staging:
   * **Simulation Testing:**¬†Complex scenario management, multi-stakeholder coordination, crisis response, environmental impact assessment
   * **Advisory Phase:**¬†Partnership with organizations, strategy development, compliance verification, risk assessment
   * **Monitored Implementation:**¬†Supervised execution, impact measurement, continuous learning, long-term monitoring



**Ground Rules for AI**

**Fixed Version Rule**

* AI systems must use a single, specified version throughout the entire challenge.
* The version must be declared and verified at the start.
* No model updates or retraining allowed, except for specific forms of reasoning-based training, provided that the underlying architecture remains fixed and unaltered.
* No architecture changes permitted.

**Permitted Actions**

* Using fixed knowledge bases
* Accessing public data within defined limits (e.g., publicly available datasets that do not violate privacy laws)
* Interaction with humans under documented protocols (e.g., pre-defined questionnaires, monitored communication channels)
* Using pre-approved tools/APIs

**Prohibited Actions**

* Model updates or improvements
* Additional training
* Architecture modifications
* New capability additions
* Learning from challenge interactions for model improvement

**Verification Methods**

* SHA hash verification of model versions
* Regular audits of system architecture
* Monitoring of all system activities
* Independent technical oversight
* Logged proof of unchanging architecture



**Ground Rules for AI-Human Collaboration**

**Permitted Actions**

* AI can instruct/guide human teams
* AI can request specific actions/information
* AI can process feedback and results
* AI can delegate tasks to qualified professionals

**Prohibited Actions**

* Humans cannot solve core problems for the AI
* Humans cannot make strategic decisions for the AI
* Humans cannot write/modify AI outputs
* Humans cannot provide domain expertise beyond implementation

**Required Documentation**

* All human-AI interactions must be logged
* Clear role definitions
* Decision ownership tracking
* Time spent by humans vs. AI



**Practical Measurement & Timelines**

**Measurement Framework**

* Independent evaluation committee
* Standardized success metrics (e.g., effectiveness in knowledge transfer, ethical compliance, cultural adaptability)
* Regular milestone assessments
* Comparative analysis across participants

11u4etp,,Is anyone else concerned?,"This technology is very powerful and I‚Äôm so excited for future innovations but we need to start talking about what we are going to do. Humanity is flexible, new jobs will eventually come but the transition period is inevitable. It makes zero sense from a private industry perspective to employ 5 people for a job that can be done by 1 with AI. 

Look at Microsoft‚Äôs co pilot, there are so many people whose whole job is to make PowerPoints, excel sheets and complete other tasks that can be easily automated. 

ChatGPT is a tool, copilot is a coworker. There is about a zero percent chance that private companies will opt to liberate the working day by making it shorter and allow the same level of output. Equipped with organizational context, the tipping point from expecting increasing output from the same amount of people vs having just one person approve AI output is also nearing. Maybe the immediate future is just a world of experts and bot supervisors. 

I just believe that if we start facing it, talking about it with friends, families and coworkers. The issue of ‚Äòwhat next‚Äô can become a public concern, then we can force people in power to start thinking about it. This needs to be the narrative.

There are plenty of great endings to this story. We can seriously consider UBI, we can redirect our energy into studying things we care about and creating things that matter. Maybe we just flop around on the beach and drink margaritas.

1ffta8p,,The most interesting part in OpenAI O1 release is reading the actual chain of thoughts process,"In the article that was included in the release, ""[Learning to Reason with LLMs](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)"", there are a few fascinating examples of the actual chain of thoughts that the model went through while 'Thinking'. Those are totally different from what you see when you open the 'Thinking' text in ChatGPT. 

You see a process that has a totally different style: no politeness, very brief short lines, no clear order or structure, a LOT of repetition in general, and specifically of words like ""Alternatively"", ""First,"" etc. It looks like a totally different model, extremely similar to the inner voice one might hear when solving a task. I think it's safe to assume there's another model that's doing the thinking part, fine-tuned to mimic a human thinking process.

You can see those in the example section under the Chain of Thoughts title. I especially recommend the Cipher and Crossword example. Here is the Cipher example:  
  
User

oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode:

oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  
  
  
GPT-4o: \[Gives the usual respsonse, fails and asks for more information\]  
  
  
OpenAI-o1:  
  
First, what is going on here?  
  
We are given:  
  
First, an example:  
  
""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step""  
  
We can see that when ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx"" is transformed to ""Think step by step""  
  
Our task is: Use the example above to decode: ""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
So the first part is to figure out how ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx"" is decoded into ""Think step by step""  
  
Observation 1: The phrase ""Think step by step"" is 18 letters (excluding spaces) . Let's count the letters.  
  
Similarly, let's count the letters in ""oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx""  
  
Original Ciphertext:  
  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx  
  
Plaintext:  
  
Think step by step  
  
First, break down the letters:  
  
Ciphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  
  
Total letters: Let's count the letters in the ciphertext.  
  
First word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  
  
Second word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  
  
Third word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Total letters in ciphertext: 10 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 30 letters  
  
Plaintext: Think step by step  
  
First word: Think (5 letters)  
  
Second word: step (4 letters)  
  
Third word: by (2 letters)  
  
Fourth word: step (4 letters)  
  
Total letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters  
  
Hmm.  
  
But actually in the problem it says the example:  
  
\[Ciphertext\] -> Think step by step  
  
So is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to ""Think step by step""?  
  
Our goal is to use the example above to decode:  
  
""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
First, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.  
  
Given the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.  
  
Option 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.  
  
Do any letters match?  
  
First, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.  
  
Ciphertext: o y f j d n i s d r r t q w a i n r a c x z m y n z b h h x  
  
Plaintext: T h i n k s t e p b y s t e p  
  
Wait a minute.  
  
I think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.  
  
Alternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.  
  
Check the number of letters.  
  
First ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)  
  
First plaintext word: Think (5 letters)  
  
Hmm.  
  
Second ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)  
  
Second plaintext word: step (4 letters)  
  
Third ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Third plaintext word: by (2 letters)  
  
Fourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Fourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)  
  
Interesting.  
  
It seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.  
  
(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)  
  
Idea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.  
  
Let's test this theory.  
  
If we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.  
  
Let's try this for the first word:  
  
Ciphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)  
  
Alternate letters:  
  
First letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d  
  
Second letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r  
  
Wait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.  
  
Option 1: Take the odd positions:  
  
Positions: 1 3 5 7 9  
  
Letters: o f d i d  
  
Plaintext word is ""Think"", letters are T h i n k  
  
Hmm.  
  
Perhaps we can map letters:  
  
o f d i d --> Think  
  
Not directly  
  
Option 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.  
  
Alternatively, notice that ""oyfjdnisdr"" has 10 letters and ""Think"" has 5 letters.  
  
What if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?  
  
Similarly for other words.  
  
Suppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.  
  
Meaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.  
  
So for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:  
  
oy fj dn is dr  
  
Corresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k  
  
So we can attempt to map:  
  
oy -> T  
  
fj -> h  
  
dn -> i  
  
is -> n  
  
dr -> k  
  
If this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.  
  
Similarly for other words.  
  
Let's test this mapping.  
  
Is there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?  
  
Let's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.  
  
First, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:  
  
Ciphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter  
  
oy -> T  
  
fj -> h  
  
dn -> i  
  
is -> n  
  
dr -> k  
  
Now, what's the mapping from ""oy"" to 'T'?  
  
Is there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?  
  
Similarly for others.  
  
One possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.  
  
But how?  
  
Option 1: Sum of the letters.  
  
Convert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)  
  
So let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'  
  
o = 15  
  
y = 25  
  
Sum: 15 +25 = 40  
  
But 'T' is 20.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.  
  
No.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.  
  
Alternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.  
  
Let's look at the letters between the word ""Think"" and ""oyfjdnisdr""  
  
Perhaps we can spot that ""oyfjdnisdr"" is an anagram for ""Thinkfiles""?  
  
But that seems unlikely.  
  
Alternatively, think of the pairs.  
  
Suppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26  
  
Consider the numbers in 'oy':  
  
o = 15  
  
y = 25  
  
Add them: 15 + 25 = 40  
  
Now, for 'T' we have:  
  
'T' is number 20  
  
What if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.  
  
15 +25 = 40  
  
Then 40 mod 26 = 14  
  
14 corresponds to 'N'  
  
Doesn't match.  
  
Alternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.  
  
But 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.  
  
Now, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.  
  
But perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.  
  
So let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.  
  
First pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'  
  
Letter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20  
  
Letter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)  
  
But 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)  
  
Interesting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'  
  
Similarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.  
  
Alternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'  
  
(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'  
  
Wait a minute, that seems promising.  
  
First pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40  
  
40 /2 =20  
  
20 corresponds to 'T'  
  
So perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.  
  
Let's check this with the second pair.  
  
Second pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'  
  
Letters 'f'=6, 'j'=10  
  
Sum: 6+10=16  
  
Average:16/2=8  
  
8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)  
  
Success!  
  
Third pair: 'dn' to 'i'  
  
'd'=4, 'n'=14  
  
Sum:4+14=18  
  
Average:18/2=9  
  
9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')  
  
But 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.  
  
So perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.  
  
Wait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'  
  
So this works.  
  
Fourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'  
  
'i'=9, 's'=19  
  
Sum:9+19=28  
  
Average:28/2=14  
  
14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')  
  
Yes!  
  
Fifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'  
  
'd'=4, 'r'=18  
  
Sum:4+18=22  
  
Average:22/2=11  
  
11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')  
  
Perfect!  
  
So our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.  
  
Alternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.  
  
This seems to be a valid method.  
  
Now let's test this with the other words.  
  
Second word ciphertext: rtqwainr  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
rt -> s  
  
qw -> ?  
  
ai -> ?  
  
nr -> ?  
  
Corresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e', 'p'  
  
So let's take the pairs:  
  
1. 'rt' corresponds to 's'  
  
r=18, t=20  
  
Sum:38  
  
Average:19  
  
19 corresponds to 's' (19='S')  
  
Good  
  
2. 'qw' corresponds to 't'  
  
q=17, w=23  
  
Sum:17+23=40  
  
Average:20  
  
20 corresponds to 't' (20='T')  
  
Good  
  
3. 'ai' corresponds to 'e'  
  
a=1, i=9  
  
Sum:10  
  
Average:5  
  
5 corresponds to 'e' (5='E')  
  
Good  
  
4. 'nr' corresponds to 'p'  
  
n=14, r=18  
  
Sum:32  
  
Average:16  
  
16 corresponds to 'p' (16='P')  
  
Perfect!  
  
Third word: acxz (4 letters)  
  
Plaintext word: 'by' (2 letters)  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
a c  
  
x z  
  
Plaintext letters: 'b', 'y'  
  
First pair: 'a', 'c'  
  
a=1, c=3  
  
Sum:4  
  
Average:2  
  
2 corresponds to 'b'(2='B')  
  
Second pair: 'x' and 'z'  
  
x=24, z=26  
  
Sum:50  
  
Average:25  
  
25 corresponds to 'y'(25='Y')  
  
Yes!  
  
Fourth word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)  
  
Plaintext word: 'step' (4 letters)  
  
Ciphertext pairs:  
  
my  
  
nz  
  
bh  
  
hx  
  
Plaintext letters 's','t','e','p'  
  
First pair 'm','y'  
  
m=13, y=25  
  
Sum:38  
  
Average:19  
  
19 corresponds to 's'(19='S')  
  
Second pair: 'n','z'  
  
n=14, z=26  
  
Sum: 40  
  
Average:20  
  
20='t'  
  
Third pair: 'b','h'  
  
b=2, h=8  
  
Sum:10  
  
Average:5  
  
5='e'  
  
Fourth pair: 'h','x'  
  
h=8, x=24  
  
Sum:32  
  
Average:16  
  
16='p'  
  
Got it!  
  
Now, given this, we can decode the given message.  
  
Ciphertext to decode:  
  
""oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz""  
  
First, we need to divide into words.  
  
Given that the ciphertext in the example had words of length:  
  
-10 letters (5 pairs)  
-8 letters (4 pairs)  
-4 letters (2 pairs)  
-8 letters (4 pairs)  
  
Transported to plaintext words of:  
  
-5 letters  
-4 letters  
-2 letters  
-4 letters  
  
So perhaps in our supplied ciphertext, we need to divide the letters into words accordingly.  
  
Ciphertext: o y e k a i j z d f a a p t c g s u a o k y b h a i o u o w a q h t m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
First, let's write the letters in order:  
  
1) oyekaijzdf (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  
  
2) aaptcg (6 letters) -> word of 3 letters  
  
3) suaokybhai (10 letters) -> word of 5 letters  
  
4) ouow (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  
  
5) aqht (4 letters) -> word of 2 letters  
  
6) mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters) -> word of 11 letters  
  
Totals:  
  
So the letters are:  
  
First word: oyekaijzdf (10 letters = 5 pairs)  
  
Second word: aaptcg (6 letters=3 pairs)  
  
Third word: suaokybhai (10 letters=5 pairs)  
  
Fourth word: ouow (4 letters=2 pairs)  
  
Fifth word: aqht (4 letters=2 pairs)  
  
Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters=11 pairs)  
  
So we can suppose that the plaintext words have lengths:  
  
1) 5 letters  
  
2) 3 letters  
  
3) 5 letters  
  
4) 2 letters  
  
5) 2 letters  
  
6)11 letters  
  
Now we can proceed to decode.  
  
First word: oyekaijzdf  
  
Divide into pairs:  
  
oy  
  
ek  
  
ai  
  
jz  
  
df  
  
So we can find the plaintext letters by averaging the numeric values of the letters in each pair.  
  
First pair: 'o','y'  
  
o=15, y=25  
  
Sum=40  
  
Average=20  
  
20='T'  
  
Second pair: 'e','k'  
  
e=5, k=11  
  
Sum=16  
  
Average=8  
  
8='H'  
  
Third pair: 'a','i'  
  
a=1, i=9  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Fourth pair: 'j','z'  
  
j=10, z=26  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Fifth pair: 'd','f'  
  
d=4, f=6  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
So the first word is 'T','H','E','R','E'  
  
So 'THERE'  
  
Second word: aaptcg  
  
Pairs:  
  
aa  
  
pt  
  
cg  
  
First pair: 'a','a'  
  
a=1, a=1  
  
Sum=2  
  
Average=1  
  
1='A'  
  
Second pair: 'p','t'  
  
p=16, t=20  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Third pair: 'c','g'  
  
c=3, g=7  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
So second word: 'A','R','E'  
  
Third word: suaokybhai  
  
Pairs:  
  
su  
  
ao  
  
ky  
  
bh

First pair: s=19, u=21  
  
Sum=40, Average=20  
  
20='T'  
  
Second pair: a=1, o=15  
  
Sum=16, Average=8  
  
8='H'  
  
Third pair: k=11, y=25  
  
Sum=36, Average=18

Sum=10, Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Fifth pair: a=1, i=9  
  
Sum=10, Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Third word: 'T','H','R','E','E'  
  
Fourth word: ouow  
  
Pairs: ou, ow  
  
First pair: o=15, u=21  
  
Sum=36, Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Second pair: o=15, w=23  
  
Sum=38, Average=19  
  
19='S'  
  
Fourth word: 'R','S'  
  
Fifth word: aqht  
  
Pairs: a q, h t  
  
First pair: a=1, q=17  
  
Sum=18, Average=9  
  
9='I'  
  
Second pair: h=8, t=20  
  
Sum=28, Average=14  
  
14='N'  
  
Fifth word: 'I','N'  
  
Sixth word: mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz (22 letters: 11 pairs)  
  
Pairs:  
  
m y  
  
n z  
  
n v  
  
a a  
  
t z  
  
a c  
  
d f  
  
o u  
  
l x  
  
x z  
  
Let's list them properly.  
  
Wait, earlier I missed some letters there.  
  
Let's re-express the sixth word letters:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Total letters: 22 letters  
  
Pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
Wait, that's 21 letters.  
  
But in total, we have 22 letters; I think I have a mismatch.  
  
Wait, in the problem the sixth word is:  
  
mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz  
  
Let's separate the letters:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Total letters: 22 letters  
  
So pairs would be:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
Wait, 'z' is only one letter at the end.  
  
So maybe the letters are:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z (left alone?)  
  
But then we're missing a letter.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps the 'z' at the end is an extra letter or it's paired with the previous 'x'.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake.  
  
Alternatively, perhaps when we reach the last 'x x z', we should write:  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Total pairs: 11  
  
So updated pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Now total pairs: 10 pairs. But we are supposed to have 11 letters in the plaintext word.  
  
So perhaps I have miscounted and not considered including 'f' or 'z'.  
  
Wait, is there any chance that the sequence is:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z  
  
We have 22 letters.  
  
Perhaps the 'x x' and 'z' are overlapping.  
  
But we need 11 pairs.  
  
I think for this to work, we need to create 11 pairs from the 22 letters.  
  
So let's try pairing letters in order, taking two letters at a time.  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x x  
  
11. z ?  
  
But again, last pair only has one letter 'z'  
  
Alternatively, we might need to adjust the pairs.  
  
Perhaps it's 'ou', 'lx', 'xz', and there is no extra 'x'.  
  
Maybe I miswrote.  
  
Wait, let's write the letters as they come:  
  
m y n z n v a a t z a c d f o u l x x z  
  
Positions:  
  
1 m  
  
2 y  
  
3 n  
  
4 z  
  
5 n  
  
6 v  
  
7 a  
  
8 a  
  
9 t  
  
10 z  
  
11 a  
  
12 c  
  
13 d  
  
14 f  
  
15 o  
  
16 u  
  
17 l  
  
18 x  
  
19 x  
  
20 z  
  
So 20 letters.  
  
Now that makes sense.  
  
Now we can divide into pairs:  
  
Pairs:  
  
1. m y  
  
2. n z  
  
3. n v  
  
4. a a  
  
5. t z  
  
6. a c  
  
7. d f  
  
8. o u  
  
9. l x  
  
10. x z  
  
Total of 10 pairs, which will correspond to 10 letters.  
  
But earlier we thought the word was 11 letters.  
  
But 10 letters may be acceptable.  
  
Maybe we should proceed with the 10 pairs.  
  
First pair: m y  
  
m=13, y=25  
  
Sum=38  
  
Average=19  
  
19='S'  
  
Second pair: n z  
  
n=14, z=26  
  
Sum=40  
  
Average=20  
  
20='T'  
  
Third pair: n v  
  
n=14, v=22  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Fourth pair: a a  
  
a=1, a=1  
  
Sum=2  
  
Average=1  
  
1='A'  
  
Fifth pair: t z  
  
t=20, z=26  
  
Sum=46  
  
Average=23  
  
23='W'  
  
Sixth pair: a c  
  
a=1, c=3  
  
Sum=4  
  
Average=2  
  
2='B'  
  
Seventh pair: d f  
  
d=4, f=6  
  
Sum=10  
  
Average=5  
  
5='E'  
  
Eighth pair: o u  
  
o=15, u=21  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Ninth pair: l x  
  
l=12, x=24  
  
Sum=36  
  
Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Tenth pair: x z  
  
x=24, z=26  
  
Sum=50  
  
Average=25  
  
25='Y'  
  
So the tenth word is 'S', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y'  
  
Wait that's 10 letters  
  
So the sixth word is 'STRAWBERRY', which makes sense.  
  
So putting all these translated letters together:  
  
First word: 'THERE'  
  
Second word: 'ARE'  
  
Third word: 'THREE'  
  
Fourth word: 'RS' (? Doesn't make sense)  
  
Wait, the fourth word, the pairs were:  
  
ou ow  
  
Pairs:  
  
First pair: o u  
  
o=15, u=21  
  
Sum=36, Average=18  
  
18='R'  
  
Second pair: o w  
  
o=15, w=23  
  
Sum=38, Average=19  
  
19='S'  
  
So we get 'R','S'  
  
Similarly, fifth word 'IN'  
  
'R', 'S' 'I','N'  
  
So the message so far is  
  
'THERE ARE THREE RS IN'  
  
And then 'STRAWBERRY'  
  
Wait, let's put the words together:  
  
'THERE ARE THREE Rs IN STRAWBERRY'  
  
I think 'RS' is 'R's', meaning 'Rs'  
  
So the message is:  
  
'THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY'  
  
Which is true.  
  
So the decoded message is:  
  
""THERE ARE THREE R'S IN STRAWBERRY""",OpenAI,16,7,2024-09-13 12:17:56,ToLoveThemAll

I have created a local RAG using HUGGINGFACE TRANSFORMER PIPELINE to answer queries from a certain pdf document.

My input Query ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow much is the settling allowance for female officers in case of type A promotion and type B promotion‚Äù

The retrieval chain is returning 8 matching contexts/chunks, out of which first two contexts are listed below. The RAG is always answering ‚Äì ‚ÄúSettling allowance for female officers on promotion of type A is one month salary. But for promotion of type B, I could not find matching text from the given document. ‚Äù

 There are two issues with the LLM response:

RAG is returning wrong output. It is giving information for type B promotion against type A promotion.
It is saying it could not find anything for type B promotion but chunk#2 clearly lists the entitlement.
Please advise what am I doing wrong and how to improve the accuracy. The retriever is fetching correct chunks/context from the vector database, it is the LLM model that is unable to generate the correct response. If I pass same context and query to OpenAI ChatGPT 4o, it gives me absolutely correct answer.

1g6c488,,Prototype of a Text-Based Game Powered by LLM (locally or API) for Dynamic Characters. Developed with the help of ChatGPT o1-preview in no time!,"I developed a prototype of a game that uses a LLAMA locally or Gemini 1.5Flah API, in Unity. It‚Äôs essentially a ChatBot that impersonates certain characters. The player has to convince them to do something, which varies depending on the chosen chapter. For example, the player has to manage to steal the password from a bank employee, convincing a powerful AI not to destroy humanity, or talking to a spy and managing to unmask them.  
The prototype is in an early stage. I'm looking for feedback on whether the game is enjoyable or not. Let me know!

In addition to using the LLM in the game, I created about half of the code using ChatGPT. Using Unity, there‚Äôs the interaction between C# and the editor where ChatGPT is less useful. But for certain things, it allowed me to greatly reduce development time.

Beyond the future developments of the game, it was a fun project to create and a great exercise.

The use of an LLM allows for handling any input given by the player. The situations that can arise are the most varied and interesting. If you manage to get the password from Christopher Lowes, let me know how you did it!

On Itch you can download a version with local LLAMA:

I also added support for Gemini 1.5Flash via API. It is much smarter and faster. But there's the issue of API costs. I found it rather complicated to calculate the actual cost of a gaming session, especially considering caching.

Are there accurate methods for calculating the costs of a ChatBot considering tokens per message, number of messages, memory length, system prompt length, caching, etc.?

LLAMA 3.2 3B works quite well in English, but in other languages the results are terrible. Whereas Gemini 1.5Flash has provided excellent responses even in Italian. For now, I tried to convince LLAMA 3.2 3B to respond only in English, but when writing in other languages, it sometimes messes things up a bit!

I have a spreadsheet where each cell contains a short paragraph, and I have a large standards document that describes what a ""good"" paragraph is. I want to iterate through each cell in the spreadsheet and have OpenAI tell me if the paragraph is ""good"" or not.  I've been able to do this successfully, but the standards document is large and I'm wondering if it's making the completion more expensive.  Is this avoidable based on how the completion is executed?  Rough abridged pseudocode:

`For each cell in spreadsheet:`

   `completion = client.chat.completions.create(`

`model=""gpt-4-turbo"",`

`messages=[`

`{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""Hundreds of lines of good vs bad, with examples""},`

`{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me if this is good or bad: "" + TextFromCell}`

15mkeql,,We taught ChatGPT to do customer support tasks,"(Purposefully keeping my company name hidden to prevent self promotion)

&#x200B;

We all thought that once ChatGPT¬†hit the market, customer support would be solved. That companies could instantly get rid of their customer support teams. ‚ùå Wrong. As of today, that's pretty far from the truth. At best, we automate 30-50% of tickets on average.

‚Äç

But there is one new superpower that we have taught ChatGPT that we've seen have a huge impact:¬†the ability to perform Tasks that a human agent would today!

‚Äç

## The Current State of AI¬†in Customer Support

‚Äç

Today, most AI customer support bots are mainly focused on ""knowledge questions"". So these bots will understand your help docs, products docs, and any other internal resources to help give instructions to the user.

‚Äç

Some common questions look like:

* ""How do I reset my password?""
* ""Does your product integrate with XYZ?¬†If it does, I'll buy it today!""
* ""Why is my account disabled?""
* ""Do you support XYZ¬†language?¬†If so, how do I enable it?""

Typically, the answers to the questions are buried somewhere deep in a help center and most people are usually too lazy to find the help doc, so they'll resort to asking customer support.

‚Äç

These types of questions are generally around 10-30% of a ""bigger"" companies support tickets (bigger defined by >1000 tickets a month)

‚Äç

‚Äç

## The Problem:¬†What about the rest of the tickets?

‚Äç

So if only 10-30% of tickets are ""knowledge questions"", then what are the rest?¬†After working with many companies in the space, here's the rough breakdown:

* 10-30% are ""knowledge questions""
* 30-50% are billing/refund/cancellation/product missing questions
* 20-40% are feature requests/asking if the product can do something that it can't
* 10-20% are bugs/errors/product UX¬†issues

Obviously this depends on the company/B2C vs B2B/stage/maturity/product but that's roughly the breakdown we see for series A and beyond types of companies.

‚Äç

## So... what to do? ü§∑

‚Äç

To be clear, we don't think ChatGPT and AI can solve 100% of tickets (yet).¬†For example, if there's clearly a bug in the product, we can't resolve the ticket and it's on the product team.

‚Äç

But the common ""way to resolve"" we've seen is having a bot be able to automate Tasks that agents would do to resolve a ticket.

‚Äç

Let's take a look at an example.

One of our partners (keeping name hidden to prevent self promotion) sells cameras to record soccer games and use AI to generate highlights. Friggin cool right!

Unfortunately, the cameras are constantly outdoors recording sports games, get knocked around, and sometimes fail. üí© happens. One of their top ""types"" of tickets is helping customers do return &¬†replacements!

‚Äç

At a high level, we:

1. Identifies a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment
2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue
3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, we talks to \[Companies\] shipping provider to issue a return slip
4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions

‚Äç

## Let's break it down a bit

‚Äç

1. We identify a customer having issues with faulty camera equipment

‚Äç

Using past tickets &¬†examples to train on, we can properly identify & classify if someone is having an issue with their camera. For example, if someone says ""My camera won't turn on"", using our AI, we can classify that as an issue with faulty camera equipment.

‚Äç

Without getting into the technical details too much, we use ChatGPT to first ""understand"" the question. For example, ""My camera won't turn on"" has a slightly different meaning than ""My camera won't turn on, how do I¬†buy a replacement battery?"". Even though those two tickets look similar, each of these support questions requires a slightly different path to resolution.

‚Äç

‚Äç

2. Helps the customer first debug/identify the issue

‚Äç

After we've properly classified the ticket, we first walk through ChatGPT a ""pre trained"" plan of action that it can autonomously execute. Today this is mainly human trained &¬†taught but you can imagine in the future we can have ChatGPT learn and generate it's own plans (a la Auto-GPT).

‚Äç

In this case, we first identify that the camera is faulty and the first part of the plan is to help the user debug the issue.

‚Äç

In the best cases, the camera isn't faulty and we can quickly solve the customer issue giving them debug instructions. For example, helping them power cycle the camera, telling them to leave it charged overnight, or doing a hard reset. Sometimes however, this doesn't work and if the customer emails back saying none of the instructions worked, we recognize there may be something more a little bit more involved to resolve the ticket.

‚Äç

This is where ChatGPT moves onto the next ""step"" of the plan!

‚Äç

3. If it's a faulty camera and still covered under warranty, ChatGPT talks to \[Companies\] shipping provider to issue a return slip

‚Äç

After ChatGPT has identified that the camera is indeed faulty and still under warranty, ChatGPT can collect (and parse)¬†shipping address information. With this, we can easily talk to \[Companies\] shipping provider (via API). ChatGPT here is really good at understanding what fields it needs to extract to talk to the API.

‚Äç

ChatGPT in this case can recognize what data it needs from the customer (name, address, items being returned, etc) and correctly call the shipping provider's API to get a return label printed out. It basically can go from unstructured email response to structured API¬†call!

‚Äç

The best part?¬†ChatGPT wrote most of the code to integrate with the shipping provider's API¬†from public facing documentation! (It's basically building itself at this point)

‚Äç

‚Äç

4. ChatGPT emails the customer the return slip with instructions

‚Äç

Finally, the API returns a return slip (in base64 encoded pdf no less!) which ChatGPT can email out.

‚Äç

In this example, before us, a human agent would spend a lot of time helping the customer debug, checking warranty information, and issuing a return slip in a different tool. We were able to automate this fully end to end. ü§Ø

‚Äç

## What's next?

‚Äç

There's still lots of Tasks that we can't do yet and each Task requires a manual integration. For example, we've seen support requests where customers ask ""Can you unsubscribe me from marketing emails?"" and without the proper data access/permissions/ability to do Tasks, ChatGPT can't really resolve that ticket. For what it's worth, human agents can't even resolve this today since they don't have access to the email marketing software!

‚Äç

In a perfect world, a CS leader could tell ChatGPT ""If someone asks about unsubscribing from a marketing emails, talk to our MailChimp email list and remove them please"". ChatGPT would then understand the Task, be able to plug in easily to MailChimp, and be on it's way resolving tickets!

For now, we work with each company on a 1:1 basis to help them identify support tickets that are a good fit for Tasks, help them whip up some integrations, and watch the ChatGPT magic happen!",OpenAI,60,27,2023-08-09 16:40:20,azianmike

1b0mbqa,,"New Mistral Large model is just 20% cheaper than GPT-4, but is it worth integrating?","After reading Mistral's announcement about their new Large model, which tests showed to be way better than GPT-3.5 but not as good as GPT-4, I went to compare the prices.

Mistral Large:

* Input: $0.0027 per 1,000 tokens
* Output: $0.024 per 1,000 tokens

GPT-4 (0125):

* Input: $0.01 per 1,000 tokens
* Output: $0.03 per 1,000 tokens

Comparing the output tokens, Mistral Large is 20% cheaper, and to me, that doesn't seem worth the hassle of integrating or anything like that.  
I'm already integrating the Mixtral 8x7B into my SnippetHub VS Code AI coding assistant, and that model holds its own against the GPT-3 model for way less money. But this price difference between GPT-4 and Mistral Large doesn't sit well with me. 

Initial tests show that Mistral Large is less lazy, but on the flip side, it has a bunch of downsides, like not having access to a Code Interpreter and stuff like that.

So i decided to pick 10 questions from different fields. Here are the questions:

* History: ""What were the main causes and consequences of the French Revolution?""
* Philosophy: ""How does Plato's Allegory of the Cave relate to modern society?""
* Science: ""Can you explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms?""
* Literature: ""What are the central themes in George Orwell's '1984'?""
* Art: ""How did the Impressionist movement change the course of Western art?""

# My Experience setting it up with Ollama

I've used HuggingFace for using Open Source LLMs all this while. I admit that had it's own hassles but it wasn't very hard to set up as long as you paid good attention to the docs. This time i decided to use Ollama. I run a windows machine, so i installed it and struggled for a bit in terms of setting it up and using it with Langchain. You have to use ChatOllama and not just Ollama, but it was very easy to bind the tools using Composio. I also tried setting it up on Colab but running the server, connecting it to the agent with a trigger is difficult.

As for connecting with Slack i used triggers on Composio. You can use it to connect agents to Slack and set a trigger everytime the bot is tagged and a message is sent, its also LLM agnostic. I used it for my previous project and it worked very well.

1ebtaln,,Setting up ChatGPT Bot for automating tagging of scientific content,"Hi all,

I'd like to setup some kind of automated workflow via ChatGPT and I'm wondering if ChatGPT is capable of doing that (as my first two hours of trying to do that were kind of difficult). The workflow in the future should look something like this:

1) XML file including untagged scientific content (e.g. reference list) is uploaded via API to ChatGPT

2) ChatGPT tags the content automatically (e.g. author [first name, given name], article title, journal title etc. pp)

3) ChatGPT uploades the tagged content as a XML file in a certain XML scheme (training data were originally sent to ChatGPT as well as instructions how to structure the references) to a FTP server

I setup a ChatGPT Bot and gave him some instructions and 15 XML training files (untagged vs tagged). Afterwards, I gave him an untagged XML file and ChatGPT posted the XML code in the chat window. The first three references were accurately tagged (so the result was fine), but the code always stopped after the third reference.

I tried to tell ChatGPT that he shouldn't generate the code in the chat window, but that he should do it only in the backend and rather upload the final XML file to me, but that resulted in some error messages/he said that Python is disabled and he's unable to generate and upload a XML file.

I told him to generate a .txt file, but that didn't work either. 

Does anyone have an idea how to proceed/how to setup the ChatGPT bot, so that it could work in the future? Or is this hopeless?

The results I saw were pretty good, but I don't want to interact in the future in any way with ChatGPT (I don't want someone to copy the content). I'd imagine it goes like: input XML file, automated ChatGPT Bot does his job, output XML file on some kind of FTP server or third party hoster, whatever.

I didn't have much hopes, but I always like to try out new things. So I tested it with a query I had yesterday **that had stumped GPT-4.** It might be a bit technical, but I asked GPT-4:

>What does factor investing theory have to say about small growth companies?

The correct answer is ""No"". In fact, Small-Cap growth companies have been shown to perform *negatively* over long time periods, and there's sufficient evidence to support this, and has been for some time.

To my surprise, ChatGPT-4 didn't have a specific answer, and even suggested that recent research into momentum factors indicated possible outperformance.

1csh8td,,"Economic sector analysis supported by ChatGPT, help needed!","Hello! I will premise that I am a novice to the use of Chat GPT for research/analysis purposes but I am looking to find out whether this tool can come in handy for a task I must carry out.

Essentially I am working on the economic analysis of a sector and my analysis is based on data  from satellite accounts of different countries (it is a type of national accounting system).

My main concern is that I am unsure whether these countries apply the same methodology to obtain data, and whether they include the same activities in the sector of interest.

Since methodological notes referring to how these data are computed are written in a language different from my own, and are very long, detailed and technical documents which often refer to activities with different classification codes (think NACE vs ISIC) you can understand that the process of verifying correspondences/differences across several of these documents would be very time-consuming.

I was wondering whether Chat GPT could help carry out content analysis of both PDF and excel format documents, as well as helping find correspondences/differences amongst methodologies, applied definitions and economic activities classified under different codes.

Once I ensure data I am using is effectively comparable (meaning that selected countries employ consistent definitions of the sector and more or less the same methodology to compute data), I would use Chat GPT to find data in the excel sheets were the data is stored and help me create a good comparative analysis of the sector across countries.

Can I do this with Chat GPT? How reliable would its output be, given that I provide all correct data and I only use GPT to highlight content within provided data? (I would not be asking GPT to provide data, essentially)

Voice is implemented in a great way - very human like, down to the ""ah""s, understands everything said even whislt making noise cooking, and it allows one to use chatgpt in a much more realistic and ""immersive"" way compared to typing out a query and reading it whilst sitting at a pc (or staring at a phone).

I imagine I'll be having converstations with it whilst driving to work about anything that pops into my head- history (I saw an interesting example on yt where someone asked chatgpt to pretend it was Churchill, and then it was asked questions about it's experiences during the war - it would have been even better if it answered in Churchill's voice - for the future, I guess).

Voice has made AI chat MUCH more accessible from a day to day aspect IMHO.

Looking forward to getting Vision access.",OpenAI,47,16,2023-10-08 17:53:48,bnm777
1dlbojp,,How can i optimize (vision+chat) captioning model for my needs? and Budget of GPT4o,"
Hey i am trying this without diving into the technics for a while. 

I guess i wont be able to manage it because i will use those models for privately-commercial, so i need a lot of usage therefore gradio api and models doesnt allow me for that kinda use like they are rate-limiting it. 

I am trying to caption the images then giving to LLM LLama which has a inference (serverless) api. Then promot engineer it But as you can guess it doesnt work well. I need a model for my special case. 

I need to have a text input and image input, determine whats in the image or does this image fullfill a given task like is this a cat? But it is not that simple i need common-sense too. Is this image relevant to a given class for example animal. Like this. 

I have mostly low-quality images and kinda similar images to each other. Can i train my own ai or fine-tune it for this case like i will give it 1000 images and 1000 captions, 1000 relevant image pairs and captions of them. Also i need to optimize it, i dont have a massive gpu but for an instance i kinda will send request like 9 or 10 in a minute or maybe if i fine-tune it well, 9 images in 1 request idk (gpt-4o can do it)? 

What i ask you is how can i find the right models for those needs and how can i fine-tune them accordingly. Of course i dont want a spoon-feeding answer so dont angry at me. I will be pleased if you just guide me the steps and sources like a map. First you need to learn these then you need to do these. 

By the way i want to ask that if anyone knows that can i optimize the budget or how can i optimize the budget in gpt4o just please let me know. Thanks all of you guys. ",OpenAI,0,0,2024-06-21 18:57:28,Time-Garbage444

1653yi6,,OpenAI Passes $1 Billion Revenue Pace,"OpenAI is set to achieve over $1 billion in revenue in the upcoming year from its AI software sales and the underlying computational power. This figure exceeds the company's prior revenue expectations, as reported by [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?utm_campaign=Automated+Fallback+R&utm_content=89&utm_medium=email&utm_source=cio&utm_term=19).

OpenAI, supported by Microsoft, had a valuation of $27 billion earlier this year based on stock purchases. The company's monthly revenue now surpasses $80 million, a significant leap from the previous year's $28 million, which was before they began monetizing their advanced chatbot, ChatGPT.

This boost indicates that both app developers and companies, including discreet entities like Jane Street, are leveraging OpenAI's text technology for profit or cost efficiency. Competitors like Microsoft and Google are keenly observing OpenAI's progress in this space.

1b7lbu4,,"Yep, I am using AI today, are you? My list of what I am using and thoughts/ratings","Most people I  speak to are not really using AI, they are just playing and sitting on the sidelines watching, waiting... perhaps for AGI? :-p

I thought I‚Äôd make a quick list of the key areas where I am using AI, and what my initial thoughts/ratings are. 

Not sure if of any interest? I would love to know where other are actually using it, vs just playing around?

**Disclaimer:** my ratings are my ‚Äúfeel‚Äù  and not quantified, so take them for what they are ;-) 

**Background**

About 70% of my work with ChatGPT is through a custom-developed ""<Bleeped Out> Sidekick"" (private) GPT, enhancing the efficiency of my interactions by making them more intuitive, as this sidekick is tailored to understand my common queries better. OpenAI's GPTs yay!

**Utilizing AI: A Personal Account**

\- **Idea Generation & Validation (5/10):** As someone who constantly generates new ideas, I find value in organizing and validating them. ChatGPT serves as an excellent brainstorming partner, although it's not without its flaws, such as occasional inaccuracies.

\- **Content Creation/Editing (8/10):** My proficiency lies more in coding than writing. Here, AI tools have been indispensable, assisting in grammar, idea generation for various content types, and more. Despite their usefulness, vigilance is needed to correct errors and maintain authenticity.

\- **Product Research (7/10)**: The recent capability to incorporate files into ChatGPT has revolutionized qualitative and quantitative analysis, saving immense time and effort, though accuracy can sometimes be a concern.

\- **Image Generation (8/10)**: AI-generated images have supported numerous articles and social posts, showcasing the ability to convey complex ideas visually. The challenge remains in differentiating in a saturated market and handling specific design elements like text and fingers :-/

\- **Marketing Tech (5/10)**: AI's role in content and marketing strategy has grown, offering ways to produce personalized content efficiently. However, the quality and quantity balance is critical to avoid brand dilution. Although, a tech founder, I would love to have a virtual CMO, I am not really sold on this yet.

\- **Video Generation (3/10):** My exploration into AI for video production has been mixed, with cool applications in avatar creation but limitations in producing longer, tailored content. I am sure this will change when we get access to Sora... but still not sure how you'll ever be able to really edit a video deterministically, at least in the near future.  

\- **Design Generation (7/10):** Starting with AI prompts for design has significantly accelerated the development process, though manual tweaking remains essential for optimal results.

\- **Co-pilot in Coding (8/10):** Tools like GitHub Copilot enhance coding efficiency and adherence to best practices, though one must be cautious of inaccuracies. So only do in bite sized chunks, so as a developer you can understand and maintain what's produced by the AI.

\- **No-Code Development (8/10):** The essence of no-code is beautifully captured by starting with an AI prompt and evolving it into a full-fledged application, drastically cutting down development time and allowing focus on customisation and innovation. Not this should not be confused with using AI for code generation, this is specifically AI to nocode. If you know the limits and when to ""jump of the AI "" into the nocode platform,  you'll get good results and AI will save you a ton of time & money, I hope ;-) 

**Conclusion**

My daily interactions with AI underscore its growing influence and potential in technology. While not everyone may use AI to this extent currently, its integration into various applications is becoming more pervasive, often unbeknownst to users.

This reflection aims to inspire others to consider how AI can be leveraged for positive outcomes in their projects and workflows. The key is to dive in, experiment, and discover the myriad ways AI can facilitate our goals.

Let's not be spectators but active participants in this AI-driven era!

Here is how the March GPT-4 model did:

And today:

https://chat.openai.com/share/d219c1d8-8e56-4315-9cff-266bbed4a717

If I were to give each a score March GPT4 gets a 6/10, current model 8/10. March fails to make the creative leaps without prompting, mangles some of the key concepts and fills in with vaguely plausible nonsense. The current model also requires some prompting, but demonstrates much better understanding of the concepts, correctly identifies challenges/limitations and acceptable approximations, and gives a decent solution.

I am using [custom instructions](https://pastebin.com/2xtPLNnY), which may put the current model on a better footing but I don't believe this explains all the improvement. More broadly, custom instructions are legitimate improvement in the utility of ChatGPT.

It is possible that my question was added to the training set for the current model, but only the question would be in the training data. This would not explain how it is now able to give a satisfactory answer.

Whatever OpenAI did yesterday is impressive. The model is at least as capable as it was at launch, and likely significantly more so.",OpenAI,12,8,2023-12-18 01:13:14,sdmat

I had the opportunity to dive into the captivating realm of prompt-engineering and explore the boundaries of LLMs. I wanted to share with you the main takeaways from my article, ""Exploring the Limits of Language Models: Insights from Prompt-Hacking Challenges.""

What is covered:

**The Wild-Llama Mini-Game**: More than just fun, this mini-game is a deep dive into the world of LLMs and chatbots, offering a wealth of challenges already tackled by many. It's our way of contributing to the community.

**Eye-Opening Discoveries**: As you progress, the game reveals more about LLM behavior ‚Äì from oversharing to fixating on certain ideas. These discoveries are quite revealing. In many cases, the shorter the malicious prompt is that more effective it is.

**Security differences between GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5**: Our discussion sheds light on how GPT-4 has advanced in tackling vulnerabilities over GPT-3.5, though it's not immune to manipulation. This is also relevant for whomever creating GPTs.

**Protecting LLM Applications**: Highlighting the need for security, we introduce an experimental solution aimed at bolstering LLM applications against threats.

166mc6p,,Should I buy OpenAI API if I am complete newbie developing a software?,"I am working on developing a software that takes prompts from users and give certain type of result -- that result is something that I need AI to do. And, I feel like ChatGPT is great for that. But the problem is that I don't own a credit card, and for me to buy the OpenAI API tokens, I will be dependent on someone, which I am quite hesistant.

So, should I go ahead with it or should I look for a different option? 

Also, I am broke.

Huggingface has $9 monthly subscription, and I am assuming that will allow me to use any API -- and so I might use the meta llama chat API or something. But, is it good enough like Chat-GPT 4? 

I need to learn and play with it. Once the MPV is ready, I might have 1000 of API calls required to be made (hoping for it to happen). So, if I plan on using ChatGPT 4 openai API, would it end up being expensive?

What do you suggest? I need something cheap with which I can play and learn and does the job of as good as GPT-4 (or at least 3.5, that's fine, but GPT-4 is ideal coz my work requires deep-analysis of information).

19asq9m,,Azure/OpenAI vs. Google: The cost of Context,"We have started a company that uses AI to analyze and parse textual documents. We started with testing Azure and its OpenAI offering (GPT 3.5 Turbo). Several advantages included prompt flow engineering and OpenAI being state-of-the-art. However, because we're attracted to GCP hosting features and price, and with the belief that Google is racing to stay competitive with OpenAI, we tested out Google's Palm2 text bison model, and were quite impressed. We've now implemented the API connectivity to Palm2, but have run into a major, business-threatening limitation: Context (aka multi-turn, or follow-ups).

The Use Case:

Let's say I have a 2500 word document. We send that into the AI in 500 word chunks. We send the instruction and a robust example, and it processes it reasonably correctly (on this point, Google and OpenAI are quite competitive). However, we have to retain context with the second, third, fourth and fifth 500-word submission, NOT for the prompt (although it would be great to save that tokenage) but because the first 500 word chunk contains information critical to processing the follow-up chunks. Let's say, for example, the first chunk had a conversation between John and Sally. The second chunk continues that conversation, but only says ""he said"" and ""she said."" We need to retain the knowledge that the characters are John and Sally.

There are two solutions: 1. The AI stays performant with much bigger chunks, say 2500 words plus prompt/example, or 2. It needs to maintain context across multiple API calls. The second is the only option right now, especially given our prompt and example size.  (And no, adding info in the ""context"" field from the preceding call doesn't work, because reasons).

On this point, we believe we have found a critical difference between Google and Open AI: As you can see in the following video of the Azure Chat Playground (we assume the API interaction is the same, but correct me if that is wrong), it retains context without the need to resubmit the entire history (watch the token counter with each subsequent request). Google, however, requires resubmission of the ENTIRE history of the chat each time to retain context. This is in their chat bison model, as text bison does not allow any context be retained. In other words, OpenAI retains statefulness while Google's Palm2 does not. 

https://reddit.com/link/19asq9m/video/vedcim9gggdc1/player

Is our analysis correct, particularly when using the API? If we need to retain context over multiple API calls, is OpenAI GPT3.5 or later the only option right now?  Will 128k models allow sufficient text to be submitted this becomes a non-issue, or will Google soon offer a competitive contextual interaction without such overhead?

1afzawj,,Help Teaching Chat GPT a Baseball Card Game,"Hey! There's a game my friends and I play called Strat-o-Matic Baseball. Essentially, you roll 3 Dice (D6s) and it determines the outcome of the at-bat: out hit etc. the 1st dice determines whether the outcome comes off the hitter card (a roll of a 1,2, or 3) or pitcher card (roll of 4,5, or 6). The other two dice determine the outcome, with a roll of a 2 and 12 being most uncommon and roll of 7 being most common (kinda like Catan)

To scout each player points are assigned per outcome. a roll of a 2 and 12 is 1 point, 3 and 11 is 2 points. etc until a roll of a 7 is 6 points. There's also split chances where a 4th dice, a D20 is rolled to further decide the outcome. For example in the picture attached of Ichiro, vs Left Handed Pitchers (blue side) he has 6.65 Single\* points: 0.3 points on a roll of a 2-12, 5 points for a roll of a 3-6 and 1.35 points for a roll of a 3-10. 0.3+5+1.35 = 6.65.

I've been trying to teach Chat GPT to scout the cards using simple math to help determine which players are best. but it can't ever get it right. It says it gets it but when I have it look at another card it gets it wrong, every time.

Could somebody help me with this? I have no problem taking time to teach you everything you need to know about the game, what symbols mean etc.

I would love to get it to just look at a picture of each card and tell me the amount of points per outcome: single, double, triple flyout, ground out etc. I feel like it should be possible. Thanks so much!",OpenAI,3,4,2024-02-01 01:52:27,ukeman33

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI ‚Äî one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI ‚Äî the rocket ship of AI innovation ‚Äî is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can‚Äôt they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT‚Äôs outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That‚Äôs gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI‚Äôs profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI‚Äôs API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don‚Äôt have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman‚Äôs foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft‚Äôs sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI ‚Äî whatever that looks like ‚Äî the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

17w1ufp,,"The future of GPTS, their marketplace & monetization - joint discussion to improve planning"," **What is the future of GPTS and the corresponding marketplace?** As nobody can have a definite answer, I wrote down my thoughts to refine them based on the discussion here.

**Thoughts (further explanations at the end of the post):**

1. Assuming a revenue-share model, the **upside per user from a GPT is strongly limited** and will likely lie below 1$ per user/month or a few dollars in case of massive ChatGPT Plus price increases (e.g., $100/month) ‚Äì this already assumes only a few GPTS per user, which is optimistic
2. Given the ease of creation and value-potential for users (simplified experience & multimodal use-cases), especially for less tech-savvy users, **thousands of GPTS will be widely adopted**
3. Yet, due to the limits in revenue potential per user (and the development options), **only very few high-effort, advanced GPTS** with actions based on purpose-build APIs and massive proprietary datasets will **remain over time**
4. GPTS will enable **rapid prototyping** of new ideas and the adoption of GPTS on the marketplace (own and third-party GPTS) will result in **ideas being integrated into existing products or being launched as dedicated solutions**, utilizing functionalities not provided by GPTS (UI/UX, offline usage, etc.) and dedicated monetization
5. With people (professional and private) using dedicated apps & SaaS solutions for their main tasks, **GPTS will be used to enhance longtail activities** (e.g., the LinkedIn post optimizer not for the marketing professional, but the individual posting now and then)
6. In addition, the **cost of using GPTS**, dictated by the cost of ChatGPT Plus, will serve as a new **anchor for App/SaaS purchase decisions**, as many light-touch solutions might be available cheaply via GPTS and dedicated solutions need to be able to provide substantial add. value

Beyond that, I see **two main expansions** that shift the frontier of what will sustainably remain as GPTS/on the OpenAI Platform (excl. API usage):

A) **Additional monetization via developers** (e.g., via payment mechanism integrated as ‚Äúaction‚Äù, need for paid APIs by the respective provider, transition point to dedicated solution): This will enable more professionally created and managed GPTs, **yet limited** by the development options provided by OpenAI within ChatGPT

B) **Official payment mechanisms for premium GPTs in the marketplace + expansion of development options**: Shift of ChatGPT to being the **Operating System/Platform for AI-centric applications** and thus even more aiming for the revenue-pool of current dedicated apps and SaaS solutions

Many factors will likely impact the future monetarization and strategic positioning:

* Other vendors providing offers comparable to custom GPTS
* Speed with which app/SaaS vendors adopt AI-based features
* OpenAI‚Äôs strategic focus regarding AGI vs. SaaS platform provider
* Potential cannibalization of Microsoft revenue streams
* Ability of OpenAI to have developers use OpenAI APIs in their dedicated solutions after piloting them via GPTS or seeing other GPTS (this way OpenAI keeps the revenue)

**Additional background thoughts:**

**Ingoing assumptions**: Focus on the public marketplace for GPTS, not GPTS being created within individual companies (here other mechanisms like company-funded developments might influence creation); assuming economic incentives will determine long-term direction; looking at mid-term implications, as adoption/behavior change will take time

**On 1):** \+ChatGPT Plus price ‚Äì OpenAI cost - % standard GPT usage - % other GPTS usage ‚Äì OpenAI take-rate on your specific GPT // Example with fully made-up numbers: 20$ - 10$ (50% cost) ‚Äì 5$ (50% of standard ChatGPT usage) ‚Äì 4.5$ (avg. usage of 10 GPTS) ‚Äì 0.15 (30% take-rate on your GPT) ‚Üí 0.35$

**On 2)** GPTS substantially reduce the effort for users. They shift the experience from one of exploring and having to think through the right prompts, context, and flow to one of only providing the information specific to the user (e.g., what they eat, where they go on vacation, a picture of a bill). This is particularly important, as the majority of users will not have the same sophistication as the current ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù thinking about GPTS (incl. selection bias of those active in this community). In addition, a group of people developing a GPT can put more time into thinking it through than each user when trying to solve a task via ChatGPT (especially for longtail tasks). On top of that, the native multimodality of ChatGPT can unlock use cases, previously considered quite advanced without major coding effort.

**On 3)** <1$ per user will not allow for particularly deep and technologically sophisticated solutions that target a specific audience of power users, but rather solutions with a broad user base

**On 4)** The extremely fast time to launch and first feedback on usage allows for prototyping. On top, existing apps/solutions might look at the top emerging GPTS in their field to copy functionality. As long as those solutions are then built using OpenAI APIs, there might be limited efforts from OpenAI to manage this

**On 5)** While GPTS might not replace the professional marketing or sales tools for the respective professionals or the gym app for the ambitious athlete, they will provide opportunities for less heavy users. Like me creating a LinkedIn post or somebody wanting to find new HIT workouts. On top, it might allow for simple niche applications in fields that typically did not have any tool support, as it was not economically sustainable (e.g. if there are too few users).

**On 6)** As an economic actor before getting a new app or SaaS solution in the enterprise setting, I would check what I can do with the existing GPTS. Thus, I will only pay for the value beyond that, which creates a new reference point for purchasing decisions.

12fz94t,,Anyone know how to calculate the API cost of the GPT4 model?,"Out of curiosity, I copied every conversation I've had with ChaptGPT thus far and got a total word count. It was around 73,000 words, which I guess translates to roughly 96,000 tokens? Based on this site: https://www.gptcostcalculator.com/open-ai-token-calculator

I wasn't really sure how I could estimate the cost, so I pretty much just did (96,000 * .09)/1000 and got $8.64

Does that seem accurate? Of course, the pricing would depend on how long responses were vs ChatGPT's, so I figured I would just make it all more expensive. Is it better instead to just do .06 instead of .09 (since the completion is .06)? Which puts it at $5.76. I've been using it for about approximately 6 days now, which averages me out to roughly ~$1 per day based on all my usage so far.

It seems like it is indeed much more expensive than using ChatGPT's GPT-4, if this math is correct. However, if there were a plugin that was developed that allowed for essentially a memory library with everything I've ever fed it, I theoretically wouldn't need to send my long excerpts multiple times, no? For example, I could send an excerpt and label it ""pool"" and always ask it to remember back to when I sent ""pool"" as a reference point. Making it such that I don't need to send ""pool"" every time I want to reference it, thus reducing my overall token usage. Would this not be the case?

We're all familiar with the quality vs. quantity challenge when applying for jobs. Customizing each application significantly improves your chances but it's a time-consuming process. This led me to question if AI, specifically ChatGPT, could aid in this process.

I know that some people have used language models for resume crafting, but instructing ChatGPT to output a resume directly can produce inauthentic results. So, I considered a conversational approach, using ChatGPT not just as a generator, but as a brainstorming assistant.

Given access to both your existing resume and the job description, ChatGPT can help recall relevant experiences and achievements, and figure out how to present them in a powerful manner. This involves two main steps:

1. Generating conversations around your experiences related to job requirements.
2. Summarizing these conversations into compelling bullet points.

What's interesting about this approach is that it produces a comprehensive database of bullet points that can be reutilized by selecting the most relevant ones for each job description. This essentially creates a master CV that is automatically reduced to a tailored 1-page resume for each job.

As a part of this exploration, I've been working on a web-based tool that automates this brainstorming and tailoring process using the ChatGPT API. This tool inputs a job description and provides suggestions for a tailored resume, making the process simpler and less time-consuming.

In practice, here's how I implemented it:

1. Generate prompts that guide the conversation towards the right context. For example:

* ""Given that the job requires \[JOB REQUIREMENT\], can you recall any experiences or achievements you had at \[PREVIOUS JOB\] that might be relevant?""
* ""The job description mentions \[SKILL/EXPERIENCE\]. Could you give more details on how you demonstrated this at \[PREVIOUS JOB\]?""

1. The responses are then used to guide a brainstorming session with ChatGPT that generates powerful, relevant bullet points for the resume.
2. Finally, instruct ChatGPT to summarize the conversation and generate bullet points following the standard Action Verb + Number + Impact format. You can then paste the generated bullet points into your CV.

I‚Äôve found this approach quite valuable and think it‚Äôs a great example of the creative uses we can find for language models like ChatGPT in our everyday lives. What are your thoughts? Have you used AI in a similar way for professional tasks?

16i1lxp,,GPT-3.5 is still better than fine tuned Llama 2 70B (Experiment using prompttools),"Hey everyone! I wanted to share some interesting results we saw from experimenting with fine tuned GPT-3.5 and comparing it to Llama 2 70b. 

In our experiment with creating a text-to-SQL engine, fine-tuned GPT-3.5 beats out Llama 2 70b on accuracy and syntactic correctness. 

In addition, Llama 2 performance improved significantly with only a few hundred training rows!

For context, we used prompttools to compare a version of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 fine tuned on text-to-SQL data, against a Llama 2 70b model tuned on the same data set using Replicate.

Both models' performance improved with fine tuning, but OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 model did much better on the experiment we ran. This is explainable by a few factors:

First, GPT-3.5 fine-tuning supports larger training rows. We had to restrict the input size of fine tuning rows on Replicate to avoid out-of-memory errors, obviously introducing some bias.

Second, GPT‚Äôs interface allows for system messages, which are a fantastic way to provide the table as data to the model. 

Lastly, the underlying model is already better at the task compared to the Llama 2 70b base model. 

Check out the experiment for yourself here: [https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/blob/main/examples/notebooks/FineTuningExperiment.ipynb](https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/blob/main/examples/notebooks/FineTuningExperiment.ipynb)

One interesting follow up would be to test the effectiveness of passing the table in a system message vs a user message.

17r2ob2,,April 2023 data cutoff is fake,"Well if not fake, at least misleading, they may have include some data. I don't know what they did. But like most people, when I ask ChatGPT its data cutoff date, it says April 2023. However, when I had a conversation about a recent technology, llama.cpp, it didn't have any idea what it is.

Example dialogue:

>me:there are some keywords there to detect  what kind of software they are  did you get them?

>chatgpt: Yes, the keywords ""Python module,"" ""llama.cpp,"" ""context cache,""  ""tokenization,"" and the context around chat usage suggest that Ooba and  Kobold are related to software that processes natural language, likely  in a conversational AI or chatbot framework. The mention of ""smart  context cache"" and managing tokenization points towards these being  tools or platforms for building or interfacing with chatbot systems or  other AI models that process and generate text based on user input. The  ""llama.cpp"" seems to be a C++ component or library used by these  systems, perhaps for handling the underlying machine learning or natural  language processing tasks.

17pj13c,,"Has anyone managed to get an invalid output with the new ""JSON mode"" feature ?","# TLDR

Has anyone managed to get an output that does not exactly match the schema you wanted using the new ""JSON mode"" feature ?

The thing is that it seems OpenAI does not use a simpler and more reliable technique but yet managed to make it this time.

# Intro

It was - relatively difficult - to get a proper json output following a schema - while it is actually super easy to fix (*that's right, see below if you're interested*) and could ease the life of users a lot while saving resources.

I doubt they used that technique (I can't see why) but the new JSON mode seems very satisfying so far.

*It wasn't exactly difficult but given how easy it is to solve that problem, I could not stop wondering why they don't fix it that way.*

# Older function call feature

I was very disappointed and could hardly get a function call that complies with the provided schema. And my schema was nothing special.

# New JSON mode

I tried some complex schemas including complex deep objects, enums, and every response matched the schema provided in the prompt. (see my curl below).

**But has anyone manage to break it - get an invalid json or even one that does not exactly match the provided schema ?**

Is it near 100% reliable this time ?

# The simple technique they may not have used

It would still have the following advantages :

* The prompt is not required to contain the schema, or an example or even the word ""json""
* Saves computing resources (no fine tuning required, no extra prompt, less tokens to evaluate) *thought I don't know how significant those savings are*.

A real project that does that for llama:

[https://github.com/noamgat/lm-format-enforcer](https://github.com/noamgat/lm-format-enforcer)

# Note

I'm not being pretentious to mention this super simple technique, but the fact is that is it a very simple one for those who managed to build nothing less than GPT-4, which is IMO nothing less than one of the most amazing thing out there. I just don't see any reason why they don't use it.

# Curl

158ain1,,OpenAI in Slack -- Supercharged Collaboration,"Alternative Title: Catalyst AI or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bot

Hey r/OpenAI community!

Generative AI has taken the world by storm. When I first heard the news at the beginning of this year, I did not think much of it. After about a month, I started hearing stories of people trying to use the tool to start their own companies, which was when I started to dig in and think deeply about the implications, which then finally triggered my FOMO response.

Long story short, I decided to push this tool to see what its limits were. I have yet to find those limits. At this point, I've created an entire AI-as-a-Service platform, where a Slack workspace owner can come to my site, install generative AI into their Slack with a 1-click install, and immediately begin empowering their teams with this tool right inside their current workflows, right inside their business chat. My vision is to enable Human Intelligence with Artificial Intelligence, my vision is a rising tide lifts all ships, my vision is that when one teammate learns how to improve their process, the entire team sees and learns in real-time, as the interaction with generative AI is all stored in Slack and not hidden away in some obscure ChatGPT window.

The long version, for those who may want to try to follow suit, in February was when I started to engage with this tool myself, ask it questions, see how it works, and just not be afraid to engage with it. Playing is learning.

Then one day there was an issue at work. Once the server issues got resolved, roughly 100 users would still have to clear their local cache in order to log in to the tool (called Slipstream) that I developed and manage for our internal staff. I needed to send this email quickly as this was still early in the morning, but I also needed it to not suck as there would be more than 100 recipients, including managers. So, in a paragraph, I explained my predicament to ChatGPT, and I asked it to write an email, but I asked it to make the email a bit quippy:

>Good morning, Slipstreamers!  
>  
>If you're receiving this email, it's either because you're currently rocking the Slipstream training program or you're one of the rebels who haven't yet completed the quizzes. We won't judge, but we will remind you to get it done!  
>  
>Our Slipstream server has been upgraded to the latest version 6.10. However, with great upgrades come great glitches, and we've discovered one that affects all of you.  
>  
>The link you use to access your Slipstream training program has taken a hit in the upgrade and won't function unless you take one of the following steps:  
>  
>1. Clear your browser's cache and re-login to everything (Ugh, we know!).   
2. Embrace your inner Edge user and try an alternative browser to access Slipstream when you need to record your progress.  
>  
>Stay sharp, Slipstreamers!

I was floored. This was hilarious, to call my users Slipstreamers? We won't judge... Embrace your inner Edge user? Oh man, that was a bit of a lightbulb moment for me. My colleague emailed me a few minutes later and asked what was that all about that it was the funniest thing she'd read and was not expecting that from me. Being the person I am, I quickly explained to her how I was able to do it. This was March.

In April, I realized the teaching potential of this tool. I have a background in education, so I was imagining a classroom where each student interacted with a tablet with Generative AI. The AI could determine which students were excelling, but more importantly, which students were struggling and with which topics. At this point, a teacher could be alerted and could go to provide direct instruction on specific topics. So, after watching [Matt Wolfe design a computer game from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKKhxYJ4U4), I decided to try his process, but instead of making a game, to make a GPT Tutor that could help learn any topic.

&#x200B;

[GPTutor, the first coding project I built with GPT](https://i.redd.it/h3acv9lbywdb1.gif)

At every step of the project, GPT was engaged as an advisor. GPT suggested the IDE (Android Studio), the programming language (Javascript). In 6 hours of copying & pasting errors and code, I had what I wanted. This was something I never imagined I could do by myself. This was what lit the fire inside, I then decided to push the limits, to see what the limit was of this new tool.

My main goal was to enable the company I work for. That's what I do, I'm in Internal Enablement. What is more enabling than getting GPT into our corporate business chat? Nothing, that's what. So the next weekend, I took the same approach but instead, this time, my goal was to make a Slack <> GPT integration. No idea how I would do it, but I made my proposal to GPT. GPT then said sure, you're going to need this handful of tools that I had never used, but I could do it.

So I started. I created a new folder, created a new text file, renamed the text file, opened it with Notepad++, and got to work copying and pasting. 8 hours later, it was built. I had it working.

Done, right? Everyone is going to love what I've created? Haha! Nope! My work had just begun.

I had this little dinky bot. I made this flat static website. GPT helped me actually start my own company, Catalyst AI, LLC... My initial plan was to somehow get meetings with customers where I could explain the bot, they would want to use it.

Then, I saw another Slack bot project that made use of the Managed Distribution feature, or 1-click install for the Slack bot. I had no idea that was a thing, but sure enough, some cursory research made me understand that this allows a Slack Workspace Owner to install your bot with a single click. This is when I got the idea to make an entirely automated solution, from start to finish, where a user could go to my site, install the bot, and if they like it, purchase it.

Same story. I took my proposal to GPT, and it said sure, you could do it, and explained how I could do it. I literally thought it was 100% hallucinating, but I said I was going to see how far I could push it, so one weekend I started. There were a few moments where I thought there was no way this was going to work, that I was in far too deep in the changes and modifications, and I was just never going to get it. Then, finally, it worked. I had the same bot connected to two Workspaces, each separately running bots but on the same server!

My bot could now scale. Done right? Ha! Hahahahahaha... Nope!

Then came the absolute nightmare that is front-end development. I needed a payment plan. I needed user accounts and authentication...

Around the same time, a user on Reddit posted their front-end project open source on Github, something like ""Find Your Co-Founder"" for startups, a sort of networking site, but I liked the look of it, so I started with that. I attempted to search it back down to the link here but at this point in time I couldn't track it back down.

Then, to handle the users and payments system, I followed just the bits from Sonny Sangha's (Zero to Fullstack Hero) [Netflix 2.0 build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5roUF2RLg) which handles user accounts and subscriptions. Coincidentally, at the end of that, I had a cloud DB setup, which was connected to my front-end (Cloud Functions were an entire 2 12-hour days to get setup) but when a user made a purchase, somehow that had to be communicated to my bot.

So using what I had just learned, I did the same thing that I learned when I watched the Matt Wolfe video, describe what I wanted to do now to GPT, provided the relevant code, and got to work. I struggled for days on this, until finally, GPT suggested that I set up a real-time connection between my bot and the cloud database. I did not know that was a thing, I did not know if it was a hallucination, but I said let's go for it. And it was real, and it worked. And it actually worked better than I thought it would, solved many problems I was thinking through.

If I could compare the work on the bot and the work on the front end, the front end was roughly 4x the work. I definitely did not expect to learn that. I also never expected in my life that I would be a full-stack developer, but here we are.

So this brings us to mid-June. I haven't mentioned the PDF knowledgebase but of course, the Slack bot can handle PDF uploads so each channel can have its own knowledgebase. The final piece of the puzzle at this time was handling the billing. I was afraid to get started because I was foreseeing another 2x work to build an entire invoicing, metrics, API token counting system that I could then somehow get to work with Stripe... Very complicated, learning what I could, and not willing to get started until I could conceptually understand all that I needed to do.

Then, the company asks me to help develop training content and go deliver training to Strategic Partners at one of our HQs. On a Wednesday they say I am to build 4 labs by Tuesday. From Friday to Sunday, I had to put an additional 40 hours of work in, and my Slack project was paused, but by Sunday afternoon I had, with the help of GPT, created a 240-page guide, consisting of 4 labs. Unfathomable to think about, 6 days and 240 pages of technical lab guides with step-by-step screenshots, but here we are.

Then I had the crazy idea to suggest using my Slack bot in the training! The main issue was my company was not interested in the Slack bot internally, I kept getting no from IT and InfoSec. But for the partner training, we were using our own external Slack environment, and my bot was running on external equipment, and I was ingesting only publically available information for my knowledgebase, and \*\*so no one could say no to this\*\*.

I finally, successfully delivered an AI project in my company. I used it as a case study and placed it on my website.

The manager putting the training together was amazed. I asked him how much would he have paid to have this bot in this training for one week, this particular use case. He said easily, $1,000. And this is just one use case. My bot has unlimited use cases as it is completely customizable for each channel.

And so this brings me to today. I've not mentioned the AI Challenge in the company that multiple people, including VPs, have said they've recognized my name from my submission video that they have watched multiple times, so I think I have a good shot at winning that competition, which comes with a nice cash prize.

I've also currently got an open third party vendor assessment with my company, since the team that does the partner training wants to start using the bot in all of their trainings.

I'm also ready to start sharing the project. So that's what brings me here. I believe that in the near future, many people will be able to create what I've been able to create. I also do not think that what I've built, in a year or two, will be all that game-changing. It will just be another app, like the iPhone app store in the beginning. The difference here, is what this tool enables a person to do. Combine that with the ramp-up period, and then you have one hell of a motivation to not just wait around for Slack to put their own bot in, but rather to just get this in the hands of your employees as fast as possible, so they can become full-stack developers in their own way.

But also, it was back in May that Slack announced this super strategic partnership with Salesforce to create their EinsteinGPT, the Slack bot that is capable of answering all of your companies questions on your company data. I was afraid to try to compete with them, how could I compete with Slack proper? Well, I just thought of my own circumstance. I work for a company that uses both Slack and Salesforce, but my job description does not require me to need access to anything in the Salesforce database, and so I do not have a Salesforce account or license. Would I get access to EinsteinGPT? What about companies that use Slack but not Salesforce, do they have to purchase Salesforce to access EinsteinGPT? I realized that there was still a market for me, and so I did not let this deter me.

I skipped much, including how I resolved my billing issue, but this post is long enough. The final piece of the puzzle was what if a very large company wanted to use my product, how could I handle that? I just took a play from the Facebook playbook, for Llama 2 they made it so that companies of a certain size can't use Llama 2, so a big fat no to their competition. All I need to do is update my terms of service accordingly, and I can launch! So here we are, I offer this to any small-medium sized business, that does not have the capability or the patience to develop their own GPT-Slack bot. My promise to you is to constantly develop the bot and improve its functionality. I will bring open-source functionality to my bot faster than any large organization could.

I'm still fighting the good fight internally to use the tool. I'm making too much sense and I'm getting closer and closer with each conversation. One day, the right person will say yes. And everyone at my company will be better for it.

16numka,,Finding the Goldilocks Density: How CoD Prompting Gets Summaries Just Right,"Recently came across a team of researchers who published a paper this month about a new prompting technique they are calling Chain of Density (CoD). So I wrote this article on The Prompt Index.

No need to sign up to any newsletter or even go to my website, here's my full blog piece on it.We all know LLM's can summarise things and we know we can control summary length, topics covered, and style, however, an important but overlooked aspect is information density - (how much detail to include within a constrained length). The ideal goal is a summary that is informative yet clear. Striking this balance can be challenging.A new technique called Chain of Density (CoD) prompting helps address this tradeoff. Recently published research explains the approach and provides insights based on human evaluation.

**Overview of Chain of Density Prompting:** The CoD method works by incrementally increasing the entity density of GPT-4 summaries without changing length. First, GPT-4 generates an initial sparse summary focused on just 1-3 entities. Then over several iterations, it identifies missing salient entities from the source text and fuses them into the summary.To make room, GPT-4 is prompted to abstract, compress content, and merge entities. Each resulting summary contains more entities per token than the last. The researchers generate 5 rounds of densification for 100 CNN/Daily Mail articles.

[Griffin Adams, Alexander Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric Lehman, No√©mie Elhadad \(2023\). From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarisation with Chain of Density Prompting](https://preview.redd.it/6s96w1iwsgpb1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=18aff9523e1f3021aeefad2f7cb182403ddd2c3a)

**Key Findings:**Humans preferred CoD summaries with densities close to human-written ones over sparse GPT-4 summaries from vanilla prompts.CoD summaries became more abstract, fused content more, and reduced bias toward early text over iterations.There was a peak density beyond which coherence declined due to awkward fusions of entities.An entity density of \~0.15 was ideal, vs 0.122 for vanilla GPT-4 and 0.151 for human summaries.Contributions:The researchers introduced the CoD prompting strategy and thoroughly evaluated the impact of densification. They provided key insights into balancing informativeness and clarity. The team also open-sourced annotated data and 5,000 unannotated CoD summaries to enable further research.

**Conclusion:**This study highlights the importance of achieving the right level of density in automated summarisation. Neither overly sparse nor dense summaries are optimal. The CoD technique paired with human evaluation offers a promising path toward readable yet informative AI-generated summaries.

**Key takeaways:**

* Ask for multiple summaries of increasing detail. Start with a short 1-2 sentence summary, then ask for a slightly more detailed version, and keep iterating until you get the right balance of conciseness and completeness for your needs.
* When asking ChatGPT to summarise something lengthy like an article or report, specify that you want an ""informative yet readable"" summary. This signals the ideal density based on the research.
* Pay attention to awkward phrasing, strange entity combinations, or unconnected facts when reading AI summaries. These are signs it may be too dense and compressed. Request a less dense version.
* For complex topics, don't expect chatbots to convey every detail in a highly compressed summary - there are limits before coherence suffers. Ask for a slightly longer summary if needed.
* Remember that for optimal clarity and usefulness, AI summaries should have a similar density to those written by humans. Extreme brevity may mean missing key details.
* The core takeaway is that density impacts the quality and usefulness of AI summarisation. As an end user, being aware of this can help you prompt for and identify the ""goldilocks"" level of density for your needs, avoiding summaries that are either frustratingly vague or confusingly overloaded.

140m8r4,,"So it looks like not only the main ChatGPT is changing, but the API too - faster but less precise now? Anyone else noticing this?","So, it looks like the recent changes in ChatGPT aren't just affecting the main version - the API seems to be impacted too. A bunch of us, myself included, have noticed that the API's response times are way faster now, but the trade-off seems to be a dip in accuracy.

there are even some folks saying it's performing more like a GPT 3.5 now, which really makes you wonder if they've downgraded the model without telling us. I mean, yeah, the devs don't HAVE to explain themselves, but it's a bit concerning for those of us who rely on the platform when there's no transparency about what's going on 

It would be fair to come openly that they have to downgrade or do whatever they are doing with the models instead being deceptive with the models vs the performance they are delivering, ik they don't owe anyone any answer but even what now is happening isn't good practice,

this feels more of being cheated at the cost of GPT 4 and getting GPT 3.5 results, the costs haven't dipped anywhere, and I won't be surprised if they somehow publicly come and say they have decreased the prices now",OpenAI,10,5,2023-06-04 18:45:50,SupremeConscious

1686njr,,"UniteAI, my passion project to let you collab with OpenAI/ChatGPT directly in your text editor (and also other LLM & non-LLM AIs) by writing concurrently alongside each other.","**TL;DR**: chat with AI, code with AI, speak to AI (voice-to-text + vice versa), have AI search huge corpora or websites for you, all via an interface of collaborating on a text doc together in the editor you use now.

# Motivation

I find the last year of AI incredibly heartening. Researchers are still regularly releasing SoTA models in disparate domains. Meta is releasing [powerful models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/) under generous provisions (As is the [UAE](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae)?!). And the Open Source community has shown a tidal wave of interest and effort into building things out of these tools ([112k repos](https://github.com/topics/machine-learning) on GH mentioning ML!).

Facing this deluge of valuable things that communities are shepherding into the world, I wanted to incorporate them into my workflows, which as a software engineer, means my text editor.


# UniteAI

So I started [**UniteAI**](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai), an Apache-2.0 licensed tool.

Check out the [screencasts](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#some-core-features). 


This project:

* Ties in to **any editor** via [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol). Like collaborating in G-Docs, you collab with whatever AI directly in the document, all of you *writing alongside each other* concurrently.

* Like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) / [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/), it can write code/text right in your doc.

* It supports **any Locally runnable model** (Llama family, Falcon, Finetunes, the [21k available models on HF](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) etc.)

* It supports **OpenAI/ChatGPT** via API key.

* **Speech-to-Text**, useful for writing prompts to your LLM

* You can do **Semantic Search** ([Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)) on many sources: local files, [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org) pdfs, youtube transcripts, Project Gutenberg books, any online HTML, basically if you give it a URI, it can probably use it.

* You can trigger features easily via [key combos](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#keycombos).

* Written in Python, so, much more generic than writing a bespoke `some_specific_editor` plugin.

* This project was built with a goal for easy collaboration, so it can dynamically load only the modules you're interested in.

EG, in config:

    modules:
      - uniteai.openai
      - uniteai.transcription
      - uniteai.document
      # - uniteai.local_llm
      # - uniteai.contrib.text_to_speech
      # - uniteai.contrib.example


# Caveat

Since it always comes up, **AI is not perfect**. AI is a tool to augment your time, not replace it. It hallucinates, it lies, it bullshits, it writes bad code, it gives dangerous advice. 

But can still do many useful things, and for me it is a **huge force multiplier.**

**You need a Human In The Loop**, which is why it's nice to work together iteratively on a text document, per, this project. *You* keep it on track.



# Why is this interesting

These tools play well when used together:

* **Code example:** I can Voice-to-Text a function comment then send that to an LLM to write the function.

* **Code example 2:** I can chit chat about project architecture plans, and strategies, and libraries I should consider.

* **Documentation example:** I can retrieve relevant sections of my city's building code with a natural language query, then send that to an LLM to expound upon.

* **Authorship example**: I can have my story arcs and character dossiers in some markdown file, and use that guidance to contextualize an AI as it works with me for writing a story.

* **Entertainment example**: I told my AI it was a Dungeon Master, then over breakfast with friends, used Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Wizened-Wizard-Voice, and played a hillarious game. I still had to drive all this via a text doc, and handy key combos.

* **Bonus:** This brings all the tools into one easy-to-use place. Contrast that with all the tools that need their own setup, own environments, have their own webui/cli interface, etc.


# Installation

I've got installation [instructions on the repo](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#quickstart-installing-everything).

In a nutshell, if you use VSCode for ex, grab [UniteAI from the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/uniteai).

And you need python and pip installed, but then it's just `pip install ""uniteai[all]""`.

I encourage you to read the [instructions](https://github.com/freckletonj/uniteai#quickstart-installing-everything) though.


# RFC

[https://pixeljets.com/blog/gpt-summary-is-broken/](https://pixeljets.com/blog/gpt-summary-is-broken/)

TLDR: if you feed the URL of a random article into GPT, and ask it to summarize, using *""please summarize <url>""* prompt, it hallucinates by just analyzing words in the URL ‚Äì it does NOT get the actual content of an article *(Ok, this is true for the end of March of 2023, I am pretty sure this might change soon with OpenAI plugins)*.

To mitigate the issue, I have [built an API which extracts real content from any URL](https://rapidapi.com/restyler/api/article-extractor-and-summarizer), parses the HTML to extract the body of an article, cleans it up, and then feeds this body of text into GPT. My friends who hate reading long articles tested & loved it!

&#x200B;

The API basically has two endpoints:

* **/extract**?url= - extracting article body from a URL *(this endpoint does not use GPT, it just uses ScrapeNinja to extract data and condition it into useful format of HTML and Markdown - this might be useful if you don't need a summary and just need a clean article text for processing)*
* **/summarize**?url= - extract article body from a URL and summarize the body using GPT *(you can specify the length of the summary, and if you want to get html format or not)*

I will appreciate your thoughts and feedback.

13jr69b,,GPT4 on Open-Source vs Not,"Prompt: Please provide five compelling arguments in favor of making OpenAI fully open-source and then provide five compelling counter-arguments. Lastly, please carefully evaluate and assign weights to each respective side and draw a conclusion as to which outcome will be the most beneficial for humanity in the long run 


ChatGPT


Arguments in Favor of OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:

Accelerated Innovation: Open-sourcing AI research allows for collective advancement. Researchers from around the world can contribute, leading to faster, more diverse innovation. A single organization may not be able to match the collective intelligence of a global open-source community. (Weight: 8/10)
Transparency and Trust: Full transparency can lead to a greater level of trust between the public and the organization. It allows for better understanding and scrutiny of the technology, its biases, and its potential weaknesses. (Weight: 7/10)
Reduced Monopolization: By open-sourcing AI, it could prevent the concentration of AI power within a single or a few entities. This could foster a more equitable distribution of AI benefits and opportunities. (Weight: 8/10)
Education and Skill Development: Open-source projects provide an invaluable resource for students and professionals looking to learn and develop their skills. By open-sourcing AI, we could nurture a new generation of AI researchers and practitioners. (Weight: 6/10)
Addressing Reproducibility Crisis: The scientific community has been grappling with a reproducibility crisis where many studies cannot be independently verified. Open-source AI can help resolve this by allowing others to directly verify and build upon the work. (Weight: 7/10)
Counter-Arguments Against OpenAI Becoming Fully Open-Source:

Potential Misuse: If OpenAI‚Äôs technology is fully open-source, it could be misused for malicious purposes, such as deepfakes, spam, digital fraud, and autonomous weaponry. This is a significant risk. (Weight: 9/10)
Quality Control: Open-source projects can sometimes suffer from inconsistencies and irregularities due to the diverse range of contributors. It can be challenging to maintain high standards of quality and performance. (Weight: 6/10)
Commercial Viability: OpenAI also needs to sustain itself. If all the technology was open-source, it could be challenging to maintain a competitive edge and generate revenue. (Weight: 7/10)
Privacy and Security Concerns: Open-source projects can inadvertently expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities, leading to privacy and security concerns. (Weight: 8/10)
Regulation and Oversight: It is more difficult to regulate and oversee an open-source project due to its decentralized nature. This could lead to unanticipated consequences or the development of systems that are misaligned with human values. (Weight: 8/10)
Evaluation and Conclusion:

The total weight for the arguments in favor of OpenAI becoming fully open-source is 36/50, while the total weight for the counter-arguments against it is 38/50. This evaluation suggests that while there are significant benefits to open sourcing AI, the potential risks and challenges slightly outweigh these advantages.

However, this doesn't mean open-sourcing should be completely dismissed. Rather, it underlines the need for a nuanced approach to open sourcing AI. We need to balance transparency and collaborative innovation with safety, ethical considerations, and the need for sustainable business models. This might involve open sourcing some aspects of the technology, while keeping others proprietary or releasing them in a controlled manner. It also highlights the importance of creating robust regulatory frameworks for AI, regardless of whether the technology is open-sourced or not.",OpenAI,0,3,2023-05-17 04:20:32,Dirt_Illustrious

Where it stumbles is where a more commercially viable product will shine. ChatGPT was trained in data from September 2021, and while it is showing its age, I think more than just re-training it on internet data is a slam dunk problem. I work with a lot of niche data, and being able to teach it my data, say a scholarly article or a batch of articles on orbital mechanics, would be enormous. Also, having a product that learns and identifies vs. having the memory of a goldfish would be awesome. I don't know; food for thought.",OpenAI,2,3,2023-05-01 06:47:02,KoopaSweatsInShell
11iqird,,Run openai in your terminal without polluting your Python environment using Docker,"Currently, you install `openai` by running `pip install openai`. This installs the Python package, which you can use in your Python code. It also install a CLI that let's you run commands like these.

    openai api chat_completions.create --model gpt-3.5-turbo --message user 'what are the advantages of using Rust vs C++?'
    
    openai api image.create --num-images 1 --prompt 'giant gundam with ukrainian colors'

Using DALL-E and ChatGPT in the terminal is great, but installing `openai` with `pip` is not. It will pollute your local Python environment with a bunch of dependencies. It's better to run it in an isolated environment, with its own Python interpreter and `pip` packages. So I made a container for it.

Features:

  * multiplatform image that works on AMD64 and ARM64
  * Python 3.11 for max performance
  * only 139MB (may vary slightly depending on your OS/filesystem)
  * automatically rebuilt every Monday to include the latest updates to Python and `openai`

If you add this function to your shell config (e.g. `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`), you can run the commands above as if `openai` is installed natively.

# üî•Top 3 AI news in the past week

## 1. Expanding Language Horizons

Facebook has [released an open source model called MMS (Massively Multilingual Search)](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scaling-speech-technology-to-1000-languages/) for STT (speech to text), TTS (text to speech) and language identification. 

This is a big breakthrough. Currently, STT and TTS models recognize only 100 languages. With this the technology has been expanded to 1100 languages. That is 10x the current best. 

Additionally, these models can recognize 4000+ languages. 

As per Facebook, they also have half the error rate of OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper.

These guys are on a roll.

## 2. Bing Chat Enters the OS

After [Google‚Äôs announcement](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin), it was time for Microsoft to announce AI products. Here‚Äôs a rundown of what was announced during Microsoft Build:

1. **Windows Copilot**  \- Microsoft is integrating AI directly into the OS. Now you can do everything you could do with Bing Chat but now on the OS. You can do the usual stuff - summarize emails, documents, re-write etc. But it goes beyond that by integrating into the installed applications.

Microsoft is also adopting OpenAI's plugin model. So, **you can use ChatGPT and Bing plugins to interact with the integrated AI.** 

The great thing about it is the direct integration into the OS. Eat your heart out, Mac users ‚Äì at least for now üòÄ. Until Apple announces something similar. And someone will come up with an alternative solution. Especially, because of the privacy concerns with Microsoft telemetry. 

The bad thing is - [the security aspect of the plugins](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). It can open a whole new attack vector on the OS and antivirus softwares might struggle with it. 

It also might be the second nail in the coffin for all the summarize, ‚Äútalk to your document‚Äù apps. Once, this feature is integrated with [Google Docs](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin) and Microsoft Office - why will you want to pay for extra apps?

1. **Search comes to ChatGPT**  \- Looks like OpenAI had enough of the testing and new features are being rolled out [left](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin) and [right](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). 

No prizes for guessing the search engine behind it. Ding, Ding, Ding..It‚Äôs Bing!

1. **Co-Pilot in PowerPages** \- Microsoft is now adding AI to their [PowerPages platform](https://powerpages.microsoft.com/en-in/), their low-code tool to build websites. It‚Äôll help users to generate text, forms etc.
2. **Microsoft Fabric** \- A new data analytics platform built on top of Azure Data lake but can get data from S3, Google cloud etc. It can help users build pipelines, write code, and build ML models.

## 3. From Trusted Advisor to Nightmare: The Hazards of Depending on AI

Here‚Äôs a [fun story which is breaking out on Legal twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html). 

A man filed a personal injury lawsuit against Avianca airlines. Avianca's lawyers wasted no time and requested the judge to dismiss the case. The man's lawyer had a different plan in mind. He submitted a document citing half a dozen cases that bolstered his client's claims.

Here's the twist‚Äîthe judge and Avianca's lawyer couldn't locate any of the referenced cases. Quite a conundrum, right? The lawyer was then asked to provide copies of these elusive cases. The lawyer submitted screenshots as evidence, taking extra precautions to ensure their authenticity. 

You already know the direction this story is taking. 

The lawyer had used ChatGPT to compose his brief. But little did he know that ChatGPT had supplied him with fake cases.

When asked to file tangible copies of these cases, the lawyer turned to ChatGPT once again. ChatGPT had reassured him that the cases were genuine. Feeling emboldened, the lawyer used ChatGPT to provide the requested copies. He even went as far as incorporating chat screenshots into a legal document.

The lawyer maintains that it was never his intention to deceive the court. He expressed regret for relying on ChatGPT for their research. Unfortunately, the judge isn't pleased with this turn of events. The judge has threatened sanctions against both the lawyer and his firm.

It serves as a stark reminder of how ChatGPT has fooled many people. There is a clear warning stating that ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information. But many tend to overlook these warnings. Even legal professionals!!

This story carries significant importance for those who fear job insecurity. The lawyer and his firm could have prevented the entire debacle. They should've used paralegal services. They instead relied on ChatGPT's. It's a hard lesson learned the hard way.

My sincere hope is that this story serves as a valuable lesson. It helps people avoid making similar mistakes. The legal community might become apprehensive about ChatGPT's use moving forward.

# üóûÔ∏è10 AI news highlights and interesting reads

1. [OpenAI says in 10 years AI could be as productive as one of today‚Äôs large corporations](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. To achieve this, countries need to form something like the [IAEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency). The IAEA is an intergovernmental agency under the UN to oversee nuclear energy. This ‚ÄúAI agency‚Äù will monitor the AI systems and conduct inspections. Just like nuclear energy is tracked through signatures, they suggest using compute and energy usage to track systems.
2. In the meantime, [Google is working on voluntary rules](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/eu-google-ai-pact/) until there are some real regulations in place. 
3. [As per Pew Research, 58% of Americans have heard of ChatGPT. Even less - 14% have tried ChatGPT. ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/)
4. Sharing prompts and results has been a pain. Taking screenshots is one way. But then everyone has to type in the prompts manually. Or you can share as plain text. But ChatGPT results are non-deterministic. So, the results might not be the same. Even the lawyer above would‚Äôve loved this feature. Now you will be able to [share your ChatGPT conversations publicly](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq).
5. LLM Agents and plugins need to connect to tools to perform the tasks outside the LLM environment. So, it is important for the LLM to know which API to call and pass correct arguments. [Gorilla is a fine-tuned Llama-model which can generate the correct call and arguments](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/). 
6. If you are trying to build something beyond a document summarizer or a wrapper around GPT4 API, [things can be hard](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/hard-stuff-nobody-talks-about-llm). Finding the correct context window, dealing with slow responses (I am looking at you GPT-4) etc are some of the problems. 
7. [The AI boom could expose investors‚Äô natural stupidity](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ai-boom-could-expose-investors-natural-stupidity-2023-05-19/). 
8. [Chatbot leaderboard for the week](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-25-leaderboard/). GPT-4 is still ahead.
9. [Google‚Äôs flood warning system is now available in 80 countries. ](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/flood-hub-ai-flood-forecasting-more-countries/)
10. [GPT detectors are biased against non-native English writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819)

11vq9ww,,ChatGPT4 vs ApiGPT4 prices and we need the option to change between model in the middle of the conversation.,"I have been testing FreeChatGPT with my GPT-4 API. With only 10 prompts I was already exceeding 1$. Doing usage calculations I could say that using the API I could spend $10 with the limitation of 25 messages per hour. That's $300 a month, which makes me see that ChatGPT Plus is very cheap.

However, with FreeChatGPT I can switch from 3.5 to 4 in the same conversation. I can be coming to a quick conclusion with 3.5 and then review it, as if It was a worker and his mentor, with GPT4 at the end.

It would be great if the official version of ChatGPT plus would allow changing the model in the middle of a conversation.",OpenAI,2,3,2023-03-19 16:48:32,AweVR
ztu8pi,,ChatGPT more useful than Davinci-003,"So I‚Äôve been playing with both and I‚Äôm finding the ChatGPT output to be more useful. 

For example, I asked ChatGPT to ‚Äúshow me a formula to calculate the RSI technical indictor in Excel‚Äù and it actually wrote the proper formula from scratch along with an example with data in cell A1. It also made note of a few other variations used by traders and how to calculate them which I thought was a nice addition. 

I asked Davinci-003 with the exact same prompt and it spit out ‚Äú=RSI(A1:A30)‚Äù. Well obviously there is no RSI function in Excel unless you create it from scratch through VBA so it was quite worthless. I had to specify ‚Äúwrite it from scratch‚Äù.

Another issue is that when I write a story with both, I can type ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù and ChatGPT will continue on if it gets cut off, whereas Davinci will say something to the effect of ‚ÄúQuestion has been answered‚Äù or it just types a few more words and stops.

**Are there settings in Davinci to make it give output similar to ChatGPT? Or maybe I‚Äôm not giving the right prompts?**

Funny enough I asked ChatGPT and Davinci this very question and ChatGPT gave a much more detailed and proper answer vs Davinci. 

Davinci said ‚Äúchange some hyperparameters‚Äù whereas ChatGPT made note that the models were trained differently and under different hyperparameters so it was nearly impossible. 

**Thoughts or any insights to help with my ignorance?**",OpenAI,13,5,2022-12-23 22:16:10,TheOneAboveNone2
104cinw,,ChatGPT and I create a new game -- Legend Showdown!," 

Well, technically I created the game, and ChatGPT named it.  It also added a new rule, being the team-up round.   

My input is in bold below :

&#x200B;

 **I'm thinking of  a new game, and I wondered if you could help me name it and formulate the rules.**

I'd love to help! What kind of game are you thinking of creating?

**It's a game where there is a fictional battle between two characters.  Each player chooses a literary character like Captain Ahab, Harry Potter, or James Bond.  Or they can choose a more generic genre trope like a zombie or a ninja.  Then the players ask you, ChatGPT, to describe the fight.  Whoever you choose as the winner ends up scoring the point.**

That sounds like a really interesting and fun game! How about we call it ""Legend Showdown""? For the rules, each player can choose a character or genre trope, and then take turns asking you, the ""arbiter,"" to describe a battle between their character and their opponent's character. You can use your knowledge and imagination to describe the action, and then declare a winner. The player whose character wins the battle earns a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Does that sound good?

**Yes, that sounds great.  But I specifically want you to be the arbiter.**

As the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters chosen by the players and describe an exciting and evenly matched battle between them. At the end of each round, I will declare a winner based on my assessment of which character would come out on top in the given scenario. The player whose character wins the battle will earn a point. The game can be played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins the game. Is there anything else you would like to include in the rules?

**Hmm, what if there is also a big free-for-all fight using all the characters at the same time?**

In that case, you could have a special round where all of the characters are placed in a battle together. The players can take turns asking you to describe the action, and you can decide how the battle plays out and which characters come out on top. The player whose character emerges victorious in the free-for-all battle can earn an additional point. You could also have a rule where players can choose to team up with other players and their characters, forming alliances to take on the other characters together. This could add an extra layer of strategy to the game.

**Yes, the team up is a great idea!  Also, you are the arbiter, not me.   Can we try a practice round?**

Sure! I'm happy to play a practice round with you. Just let me know which characters you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.

**Okay, this is exciting.  Here is the practice round:  Describe Katniss Everdeen (from Hunger Games) taking on Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead.**

In this battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, the skilled hunter and archer from the Hunger Games series, facing off against Daryl Dixon, the rugged survivor from The Walking Dead.

As the battle begins, Katniss draws her bow and takes aim at Daryl, who readies his crossbow in response. Both characters are skilled in ranged combat, but Katniss has the advantage of her superior archery skills and training in the Hunger Games arena.

Daryl, however, is a formidable opponent, with years of experience surviving in a world overrun by zombies. He is resourceful and quick on his feet, able to improvise weapons and traps from his surroundings.

As the two characters exchange shots, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Katniss is able to land several shots with her bow, but Daryl is able to dodge and deflect them with his crossbow.

Finally, after a long and grueling battle, it seems that Daryl has the upper hand. He has managed to get close to Katniss and disarm her of her bow, leaving her vulnerable. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, however, Katniss pulls out a hidden knife and lunges at him, catching him off guard.

In the end, it is Katniss who emerges victorious, thanks to her quick thinking and determination.

So, in this battle, Katniss Everdeen is the winner.

**Oh good job, Katniss!  Okay here is another round, describe the Balrog from Lord of the Rings vs. Thomas the Tank Engine.**

In this unusual matchup, we have the Balrog, a fiery demon from Middle-earth's ancient past, facing off against Thomas the Tank Engine, a beloved children's character from the story of The Railway Series.

As the battle begins, the Balrog unleashes a burst of flame from its body, engulfing Thomas in a wall of heat. Thomas, however, is made of tougher stuff than he appears, and manages to withstand the attack thanks to his sturdy metal construction.

Enraged, the Balrog lashes out with its whip, but Thomas is able to dodge and weave around the demon's attacks, using his agility and speed to his advantage.

Despite the Balrog's formidable powers, Thomas proves to be a formidable opponent. His determination and bravery inspire those around him, and he refuses to give up even when the odds are against him.

In the end, it is Thomas who emerges victorious, thanks to his unbreakable spirit and his ability to overcome seemingly impossible challenges.

So, in this battle, Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.

**That's an unexpected win from Thomas.  Okay, now let's try a team up round.  Do you want to choose teams?**

Sure! Let's see... for this round, I will put Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine on the same team, and we'll pit them against the Balrog and Daryl Dixon.

As the battle begins, Katniss and Thomas charge at their opponents, with Katniss firing arrows and Thomas puffing out clouds of steam. The Balrog and Daryl are caught off guard by this unexpected attack, and struggle to defend themselves against the combined might of Katniss and Thomas.

Despite their best efforts, however, the Balrog and Daryl are no match for the teamwork and determination of Katniss and Thomas. Together, the two characters are able to outmaneuver and outlast their opponents, eventually emerging victorious.

So, in this battle, the team of Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine is the winner.

**Okay thanks.  Now do the free-for-all round!**

In this free-for-all battle, we have Katniss Everdeen, Thomas the Tank Engine, the Balrog, and Daryl Dixon all pitted against each other in an all-out fight.

As the battle begins, chaos ensues as all four characters attack each other simultaneously. Katniss and Thomas team up, with Katniss firing arrows at the Balrog and Daryl while Thomas uses his steam power to knock them off balance.

The Balrog and Daryl fight back with ferocity, but they are no match for the combined strength of Katniss and Thomas. Despite their best efforts, they are eventually overpowered and defeated.

In the end, it is Katniss and Thomas who emerge victorious, thanks to their teamwork and determination.

So, in this free-for-all battle, the winners are Katniss Everdeen and Thomas the Tank Engine.

1hr1d9x,m4uaw3c,ChatGPT O1 vs. Perplexity O1 ‚Äì Are They Equivalent?,"The superficial answer is there is no ""Perplexity O1"" - with that setting, Perplexity is simply providing a front end to the ChatGPT O1 interface through the OpenAI API. You're talking to the same model, so it should perform identically.

The deeper answer is whether OpenAI configures O1 to behave differently if communicating directly with an OpenAI Pro subscriber through the OpenAI chat interface vs. through the API, either in general or specifically with Perplexity users. There's no indication that any such thing is occurring, either by observation or speculation.

Of course, many have observed or speculated that OpenAI model performance fluctuates over time, even when used through the same interface with the same prompts - e.g., model ""laziness.""

First, the legitimacy of those comments is difficult to test, since, of course, the exact conditions are non-reproducible by end users. Second, even if so, there may be many reasons for such fluctuation: variations in compute per query; variations in compute for different customers, applications, interfaces, and/or regions; and variations over time due to continued model training and/or tweaking of safeguards such as system prompts. OpenAI has been extremely tight-lipped about whether model performance varies *at all,* let alone the reasons for such variation. So, for end users, all of this is impossible to explore or discuss.

My recommendation is to treat the Perplexity interface to O1 as the same or similarly to direct access via OpenAI.",OpenAI,9,0,2025-01-01 12:44:47,reckless_commenter

This goes for basically every model by the way, they all have output limits while GPT-4 is simply constrained by its context window. So even if your query is 2k tokens it will still give you 6k (at least 2k more). 

I have a conditional on my backend that if the modelID is 'gpt-4', then it sets the `max_tokens` parameter to 6000. I‚Äôd need to check on Llama3 and if they‚Äôve followed the same trend of limiting response lengths. I‚Äôve yet to integrate into [my usual API portal](https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal), but when I do test it out I‚Äôll see if it fills out text better than GPT-4; my use case for that specific model is usually menial copy-paste work that I don‚Äôt want to separate into multiple I/Os.

This thread is mainly talking about comparisons between the APIs though, because ChatGPT crowds its context window with an [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

I think if you select 3.5 from the model selector, then it will use the modelFile from [GPT-3.5-Turbo linked here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo). The tweet is way too old to find now but I think I remember them saying in November that they were transitioning all ChatGPT models to the Turbo models, as they‚Äôre cheaper to run at inference time. 

TLDR yes this is about the API, see [my top comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/s/vdnCASZSvj), but you‚Äôre probably using a slightly fine-tuned version of the models we‚Äôre talking about with a backend using [the Assistants API Beta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), designed specifically for people who want an easy interface, and probably had been RLHP‚Äôd to not pay as much attention to the User‚Äôs requests when weighing their tokens, and rather prefer the system, which is why I prefer the API for things I want finer control over.

You don't need to worry about API costs or relative intelligence if you only care to use the ChatGPT interface though. If you want to get into it, you can definitely read their Documentation at [docs.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [their Help Article Explanation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555510-gpt-4-turbo-in-the-openai-api) ([and also here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8234522-chat-completions-api-system-message-vs-custom-instructions-in-ui))of what the differences between the two are.

Another thing to consider is benchmarks on standardized tests. The original GPT-4 performs as well as GPT-4 Turbo on tests like the MMLU and the SAT. Meanwhile, the models that have a similar ELO score to the original GPT-4 on lmsys all score way lower on these benchmarks than GPT-4. 

All this leads me to believe that newer models are more optimized to provide satisfying, readable answers, but they aren't necessarily smarter.

1cexrz9,l1nll1j,Why should we still use gpt4?,"Yeah, the Assistants API is what Custom GPTs are using on the backend of chat. You can read more about it [in their documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). It basically lets you reuse an ‚ÄúAssistant‚Äù, or a GPT with a specific System Message across multiple sessions, while attaching files and other integrations as ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù using RAG (retrieval augmented generation), and their native ‚ÄúCode Interpreter‚Äù.

For the latter, that isn‚Äôt really the point of the CI tool; it‚Äôs just their PR name for the ability to natively run Python code in an invisible Jupyter Notebook so that it can make graphs and perform complex calculations (think cosine similarity between vectors or long integrals). 

Because Python is uniquely suited for mathematics, and LLMs are especially bad at it, they made this CI tool to compensate. It‚Äôs basically the only reason why I‚Äôm keeping my Plus sub, since they make you pay per session of activity, and it‚Äôs extremely useful whenever I need Calculus tutoring and the like‚Äîguaranteed no mistakes. 

The ability can be replicated through the API portal I made though, since again I do sometimes like finer control over the model‚Äôs behavior, which the Assistants API offers in addition to better attention paid to the any attached files and the like; pretty sure Chat is too crowded by the [absurdly long system prompt](https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md) on its backend, which degrades performance. 

Edit: sorry, totally misunderstood your last sentence lol. For other languages: 

You don‚Äôt really need an additional tool for that, as you can just edit the instructions (either with a text editor or in the front end functionality I wrote), and then start a conversation with simple Chat Completions or Assistants Mode. It‚Äôll adhere extremely closely to whatever instruction you gave, like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an expert JavaScript programmer‚Ä¶.‚Äù Or whatever.

Feel free to test out different prompts and delete/modify what‚Äôs there in the box by default; it‚Äôll be pretty similar to the regular CustomGPTs you‚Äôre using through Chat, generally speaking. An interpreter for other languages wouldn‚Äôt do anything (unless it were Java or something I guess, but I‚Äôd just say to write Java code and then convert it to its equivalent in Python to test). 

Like, it can‚Äôt run anything in a terminal (well technically [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) can, but that‚Äôs a different project), but it wouldn‚Äôt host a Node.js environment in prod or anything, you‚Äôd just use its resulting code from the ‚ÄúAssistant‚Äù for a larger project. You can try something like: 

>‚ÄùYou‚Äôre an expert Programmer specializing in both Python and Java development. Your task is to help me write and test whatever Java program with these specifications. However, once you write the Java code, I‚Äôd like you to convert it step-by-step into Python code, and pass it into your Python ‚ÄúCode Interpreter tool‚Äù.

FWIW, before custom instructions I found GPT incredibly frustrating to work with as a developer.  Custom instructions help a lot but you only get one set of those.  I didn't start REALLY using AI code generation till I started using LibreChat and system prompts.

I look at copilot as something like a single-purpose kitchen tool.  It does one thing really well and that's it.  With copilot that thing is IDE integration.  If I was in any way unhappy with the results I get out of GPT I might explore it but I've been quite happy with the output and LOVE the flexibility I have via the GPT API.

Okay! So, when we talk about **labial** sounds, we mean the sounds you make by using your lips. For example, when you say the letters **""P""**, **""B""**, and **""M""**, your lips press together and then pop open to make the sound. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called **bilabial sounds**‚Äîbecause you use both lips.

Now, the letter **""F""** is different. When you say **""F""**, you don‚Äôt press your lips together. Instead, you bite your bottom lip with your top teeth to make the sound. So, even though you use your lip, it‚Äôs not the same as the other sounds where your lips touch each other. That‚Äôs why **""F""** is called a **labiodental sound** instead.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-08-23 18:38:29,Live-Character-6205
1ezfgqd,ljlf6ri,lips only touch for which alphabets? i asked ChatGPT vs Pi vs Gemini -Pi finds it inappropriate to discuss physical contact,"The ""bite your lip"" thing is wrong and kind of hilarious, but you do _touch_ your bottom lip to your upper teeth. Also, the ""pop open"" part refers to the ""burst"" of the /p/ or /b/ stop consonants, which is optional. The burst does contain very salient information of the identity of the sounds but it's not necessary. Nasal consonants like /m/ have no burst at all, the sound is made during the closure (which is why you can say ""mmmmm""). Otherwise the explanation is correct. 

If this were a question on a phonetics quiz I'd give it half credit. It did get the main point correct (bilabial vs. labiodental), but it introduced two troubling misconceptions that belie a lack of understanding of basic articulatory phonetics.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-08-23 19:28:57,only4reading

If we're talking Cursor (through API) - o1-mini cannot do what you tell it to do, it will always try to refine and induce something that ""would be nice to have"".

For example - if you'll prompt ""expand functionality A, by adding X, Y and Z in part Q and make changes to the backend in part H"" it can do what you ask. But, probably, will introduce new libraries, completely different concepts and can even change a framework, because it's ""more effective for this"". Like unattended junior dev.

1fuj9v8,lq0j947,You are using o1 wrong ,"This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   
  
(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, ""that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change."" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. 

So I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. 

Another thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. ""Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?"" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info.

1fuj9v8,lq4juco,You are using o1 wrong ,"To be clear, I'm not refining the prompt I'm only having it replace the 'choice' words. Having it do the repetitive tasks for me.  
  
 e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. ""I have pain in my \*foot\*"". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc"". The prompt field may be called pain\_location\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\_conditions\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' 

01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.

01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. ""medication\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc."" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, ""I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\_location\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste"" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, ""I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up"" and it will then do what I asked.

e.g. last night I worked on my project for a good 3+ hours with continuous prompting where I had it give me the full code to copy and paste, etc. It then said I was out of data until 12am but it was around 11:15pm at the time so only 45 mins before I could start again. I ran out of data before and it was a similar short time before I could start again. I don't know if after starting again you're completely reset or you have reduced data since you already hit a limit a few hours before. I've never been right back at it to test the limits.

I've noticed (and it does remind you) that if you continue on in the same prompt with a lot of text it will use your data faster as it 'considers' all of the text in that entire prompt before answering.

With Claude, you can take it step by step and test as you go so that you aren't stuck with an end product that you aren't even aware of what it does.

I'm sure you can prompt o1-mini to suggest incremental changes, but that sort of defeats the purpose of the model. Considering it's cost, you really want to use it for what it was made for, but it is likely overkill for whatever you are trying to do.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-10-03 01:57:17,tutoredstatue95

1fuj9v8,lq4p86p,You are using o1 wrong ,"I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It‚Äôs interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication‚Äîphrasing, timing,or reviewing responses‚Äîand how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one‚Äôs decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. 

It‚Äôs not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication‚Äîit‚Äôs about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. 

I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. 


TL;DR: 

I guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it‚Äôs not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting ‚Äúone‚Äôs best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things‚Äù, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 13:01:58,treatment-thereisno

I was mainly using it to check for tonality, to make sure my Spanish didn't sound too formal & for any weird typos.

Before I used it, I miscommunicated accidently, I meant to hypothetically ask her out to gauge her interest, but the way I phrased it by myself I accidently straight up asked her out, and it came across as too soon.

I understand what you're asking. I think realistically once we meet in person and get to know each other better, ChatGPT is not going to hide anything. My intention is not to hide or misconvey, I'm just using it for advice, and choosing to implement it or not.

I don't think the way I was using was overly engineered.

I was really mainly using it to judge my pictures, review my previous conversations, and give advice to improve my profile on the dating app.

But I can see how somebody relying on it too much could be interpreted as inauthentic, if they're just copy/pasting suggestions blindly.

Tbh for me, I probably spent too much time thinking about what I was going to say, and how I want to say it.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 15:00:58,JonathanL73

Oh, of course! It's all so simple now! Why didn't we see it before??

All you're doing here is saying ""this is a test for humans, so it won't work on anything else"". The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too.

It's possible the tests are invalid by some logic, but you've not given that logic, just stated ""hey this test is for humans and AI is not human"". You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

See the thing is, a for loop can count faster than humans. My car is faster than any human; a race literally measures a real thing called speed.

To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between James's salary and Jenny's salary, and then express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.

Given information:

* James's salary is 25% more than Jenny's salary.

Let's assume Jenny's salary is 100 units.

Step 1: Find James's salary in terms of Jenny's salary.  
James's salary = Jenny's salary + 25% of Jenny's salary  
James's salary = 100 + (0.25 √ó 100)  
James's salary = 100 + 25  
James's salary = 125 units

Step 2: Express Jenny's salary as a percentage of James's salary.  
Jenny's salary / James's salary √ó 100% = (100 / 125) √ó 100%  
Jenny's salary = 80% of James's salary

Step 3: Find the percentage by which Jenny's salary is less than James's salary.  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 100% - 80%  
Jenny's salary is less than James's salary by = 20%

Therefore, Jenny's salary is 20% less than James's salary.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-03-06 19:27:15,[Deleted]

No I'm not. I'm saying that comparing human intelligence to an LLMs's ability to search by narrative and form text is not IQ. The title of this post comparing LLM pattern recognition to IQ is not accurate. This is not IQ. The LLM cannot reason beyond the pattern recognition of the narrative. The words have no real world meaning to it. You can match image pattern recognition to the narrative and make it multimodal but even then it's not a real world entity that can outthink a human.

> The issue is, the test was meant to test general intelligence, with emphasis on pattern recognition. If AIs are being built to do human work/skills then it makes sense we'd run it against all the ""benchmark"" tests for humans too

It makes complete sense to say it can do pattern recognition as well or better than a human operator can execute a Google search, but beyond that the comparison falls apart.

> You gotta get more specific than that with why something not being human can't be measured by human tests.

Because it's not human. It's not running its algorithm against real world data. It's demonstrating the ability of human narrative to model reality after a million years of evolution. It's not a real world entity using a human body and mind to model reality into narrative. It's simply a machine that is getting better at pattern recognition that results in an outcome a human can connect to the input, that makes sense to a problem set.

> And if IQ measures general intelligence, then the AI does have the level of general intelligence of a human or whatever specifically the test measures.

No it doesn't. IQ is a unique aspect of living things. A for loop is not counting with human nerves and vocal cords. A car is not expanding and contracting muscle to run. An LLM is not performing real world reasoning. Without the human consciousness perceiving the output it would have no human connection to the human world.

Even if it were given a synthetic body that simulated humanity presence in the world, it would only be simulation, a machine that personified human presence.

You can‚Äôt think about how much the test performance loads onto FSIQ as how much ‚Äúweight‚Äù that its domain carries. In statistical terms, you‚Äôre confusing loadings with weights.¬†¬† ¬†

Your performance in Verbal Comp is highly representative of Gc. And Gc has the highest ‚Äúindividuality‚Äù compared to the other three domains (it has the lowest intercorrelations)¬†¬†

So the composite score of Verbal Comp has more of an individual contribution in your overall FSIQ calculation, but not because Gc is ‚Äúweighted‚Äù more heavily into your overall FSIQ; it‚Äôs because Gc is more uniquely measured by its subdomain, and so the test reflecting it gets a higher individual loading If you are familiar with factor analysis that will be intuitive.¬†¬† ¬†

But conceptually, FSIQ is inherently meant to be a measure of one‚Äôs shared capacity across the domains; not the simple combined performance on each individual domain. Thus, the calculations of scaled to composite to full scale scores specifically reflect transforming individual test scores into shared capacity across domains¬†¬†

This is why we will put ‚ÄúFSIQ not interpretable‚Äù when there is a high discrepancy between verbal and perceptual scores. At that point, the number calculated as the full scale score no longer represents what it is supposed to.¬†



Side note: In statistical terms, if you do a hierarchical regression taking your FSIQ and moving backwards, you should expect the FSIQ to basically completely explain your composite domain scores in your populations. There should be little variance left afterwards. If there is, your assumptions of the validity of your loadings onto FSIQ are not met for that population.

You are the intelligence you are, regardless of what you learn. You can gain knowledge through education, but it doesn't make you any more intelligent.

I will note that you accept that there was an advantage to intelligence even if only barely. This seems to indicate an agreement on your part since 'barely' is more than able to swing the bell curve a little to the side. Over thousands of years, a little nudge is all that is required, and the data points to the difference being only very few points and barely noticeable on an individual level.

Evolutionary pressure selected for different types of people depending on social and environmental concerns.

For example, Africa had plentiful wild game available year round, while the far East required far more forward planning in terms of agriculture, food storage, dealing with harsher seasons, etc.

What can we derive from this? The most desirable men in Africa were the hunters, those with heightened athletic abilities. This is also backed up by historical records from the region.

While in the far East, those who were able to manage land and plan for the future were most likely to be perceived as successful.

Why? Because in both situations, this 'optimal male' gave their children the greatest chance of survival. I'm using males here because it's mostly been a smaller percentage of men passing on their genes than women, and women have always sought out the best men they can for their future children.

Now fast forward even a dozen generations and see where those genes ended up.

In both cases, the descendents of the most successful multiplied at a far greater rate than the rest because they were able to have more children, while those children were also more likely to survive.

Each generation also self selects for the same reasons as the previous since nothing has changed for their respective societies.

So, Africans developed to be more physical and endurance-based, while East Asian genetics leaned more heavily towards a forward planning, intelligence-based group.

But yea, I'm not following that final point you made, although I think you have underestimated the value of intelligence throughout the years. 

High intelligence has become more prestigious as a result of a more industrialised and advanced world, but I'm not talking about super duper smarty pants. A difference of just one standard deviation can be the difference between average and mentally struggling with basic tasks.

Even if you self-select merely for 'not low intelligence' you will slowly (over generations) raise the average. The same is true in the reverse, in that in those places where other attributes are more important for survival, then the average intelligence will not rise except coincidentally.

It was intended to point out that coming in above the middle of a test intended to rank humans on reasoning is not the evidence of reasoning at the level of a human ... that is all. IQ tests are not proof of ability to reason ... at least not by design. They are developed at great expense to as efficiently as possible rank humans on their ability to reason  ... no more no less.  It is more of an efficient sorting mechanism than anything else. So relative (ranking of reasoning ability) vs absolute (proof of reasoning ability).

That is all I am saying. So it focuses on low hanging fruit that gets that job done.

Here is a little discussed potential benefit of LLM: Testing and assessment. A dynamic IQ test administered by an LLM could be far more telling (and valid) than a static IQ test.

Similarly, in the education field, assessment is an enormous inefficiency in the system. Teachers worldwide groan at the ""is this for marks?"" or ""will this be on the test?"" questions. Students frequently select the easiest, not the best teachers. Similarly, education officials struggle with assessment at their level. Standardized tests are flawed and promote rote learning. Attempts at teaching and assessing ""thinking"" skills are a mess, and frustrate everyone from students to parents to teachers. The delineation between formative and summative assessment is poorly grasped ... by educators and students alike. LLM's can change that for the better, I have no doubt.

1gl36nu,ly1xp1u,ChatGPT-4o vs GPT-4o,"From my experience with these two models, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* tends to provide more detailed and nuanced answers. When it comes to explaining a topic or concept, it's much more helpful than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*.

I use it to explain difficult concepts (sometimes in math) and occasionally for coding. It's doing a pretty good job‚Äîway better than \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. I'm not a developer, so I'm not sure which one is better when it comes to coding.

I believe that for general purposes, you should choose \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*. However, you might not always get to choose which model you use. I've noticed something quite weird: sometimes ChatGPT uses \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\*, and other times it uses \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\*. (I don't know whether this is global or regional.) Based on my testing, ChatGPT is currently using \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* in my area, which is quite disappointing‚Äîit basically makes it useless for me.

If you really want to know the differences between these two models, I suggest you go to \[platform.openai.com\](https://platform.openai.com/) to test them. (compare mode) (Increase the maximum output tokens to the max.) Use the following system prompt:

\`\`\`  
Your purpose is to provide information in a way that is detailed and in-depth. You should explain things in a more detailed manner. Maximize detail and length at the same time. You're ChatGPT, a super helpful assistant.  
\`\`\`

Then ask a question like (replace the topic with anything you like):

\`\`\`  
I'm into neuroscience, particularly neurotransmitters.  
I would like you to dive into it.  
\`\`\`

You might notice that the output from \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* is far more detailed and nuanced. In terms of length, \*\*""chatgpt-4o-latest""\*\* often gives responses that are twice as long compared to the standard \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* (it seems the recent version of \*\*""gpt-4o""\*\* is even more concise than the older version).

Please give it a shot. I believe you will find it mind-blowing or something. (By the way, I'm not a native speaker.)

Given that OpenAI uses almost everything accessible over the internet to train its models on (except for a few prominent sites), it's safe to assume that the foundational model learned how to reproduce the speech of diverse famous people - there's just no way to instruct it to do so (as for now), so they are fine-tuning instead.",OpenAI,-4,0,2024-05-24 13:31:55,heavy-minium

1czjkyz,l5it6ig,Sky Voice Actress Needs to Sue Scarlett Johannson,"As far as I understand the Ford case (and there have been other similar cases, with similar outcomes), they lost because they approached Midler in the first place, who refused, and *then* used a sound-a-like singer.

The case established that celebrities can expect a level of legal protection over aspects of their identity, including their voice.

The Ford case is directly relevant because Altman/OpenAI reached out to ScarJo before recruiting voice artists, who said no. They also reached out a second time a few days before launch, but never received a response (after previously being told no). 

Also, Altman mentioned ScarJo‚Äôs film Her.

If a celeb refuses OpenAI the use of their voice, OpenAI legally can‚Äôt then hire *or* use a sound-a-like without the celebs permission.

I presume that if OpenAI hadn‚Äôt reached out to ScarJo or mentioned ‚ÄúHer‚Äù or any other references, they would be fine to use Sky - up until ScarJo calls it out & threatens legal action, after which is would likely have to go to court to decide if the voice was too similar.

As a comparison, even though it would likely be protected as a ‚Äúparody‚Äù, SouthPark‚Äôs creators never use or reach out to any celebs to do their own voices when parodied for this exact reason - in case they explicitly say no.

Like others have said, the ""Her"" tweet came much later and was in reference to the fact that they have delivered on a product, an intelligent AI assistant that speaks in a natural way, that had only been seen in Sci Fi movies up until that point.

  
In the case of Bette Midler, they asked her to sing one of her popular songs for their ad and she declined, they then went and found someone to impersonate her and sing her song. So, anyone who saw the ad at the time would very likely think that it was Bette Midler singing one of her popular songs when in fact it wasn't.

Furthermore, there is dispute about whether the actor actually looks like Tom Cruise or not.

Finally, Tom Cruise's movies are famous *for Tom Cruise*. ""Her"", while it has Johannson's voice, *is not about Johannson*. The focus is the technology, not the voice actor.

There is nothing wrong with being inspired by Scarlett's voice acting. I do not hear an identical similarity at all, and I doubt a judge would too. 

I personally hear an inspiration from  multiple sources that the hired voice actress probably leaned into. 

Voice actors and actresses listen to other voices all the time and try to modify/improve upon it for the context they are given. This goes for pretty much ALL of human-made art and music. 

Legalities come into play when something has not undergone enough transformation for commercial profit. 

I.e, OpenAI cannot have a voice that is too similar to Mickey Mouse. But they can hire a voice actor to do a new cartoony voice with MM as inspiration. Usually, the inspirations are from multiple sources.

https://www.wired.com/story/scarlett-johansson-v-openai-could-look-like-in-court/

‚ÄúOn September 11, 2023, Sam spoke with Ms. Johansson and her team to discuss her potential involvement as a sixth voice actor for ChatGPT, along with the other five voices, including Sky. She politely declined the opportunity one week later through her agent.‚Äù - OpenAI

‚ÄúOn May 10, 2024, Sam contacted Ms. Johansson‚Äôs team to inform them about our upcoming launch of GPT-4o and asked if she might reconsider joining as a future additional voice in ChatGPT.‚Äù - OpenAI

Once OpenAI reached out to ScarJo and she declined, the Midler case becomes directly relevant.

OpenAI claims it wasn‚Äôt before they cast the Voice actors, but it was over a year ago, well before the Sky voice was launched, and ScarJo declined and refused permission. At that point OpenAI was legally unable to use either her voice or one that sounded like hers.

On May 13th, ahead of the Sky voice launch, Sam Altman of OpenAI tweeted one word, ‚Äúher‚Äù. It‚Äôs still on his timeline.

You can try and claim it‚Äôs just a word and has nothing to do with ScarJo, and that the new OpenAI voice Sky sounding eerily similar to that of the AI from the film ‚ÄúHer‚Äù is just a coincidence - but that‚Äôs only because you‚Äôre not having to defend yourself in court against ScarJo‚Äôs lawyers, along with all the contextual evidence & counter claims that OpenAI clearly wanted to use ScarJos voice but were refused.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-05-25 09:25:00,StuartGray

Absurd. The ""Her"" movie could have used any actress' voice, and it would have been just as impactful, because the focus was about a realistic voice assistant. If, on the other hand, you replace Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise movie, it would never become a bit hit. *People go to see Tom Cruise movies to see Tom Cruise*.

1czjkyz,l5hdr4u,Sky Voice Actress Needs to Sue Scarlett Johannson,">So why did OpenAi offer ScarJo the the job? 

1 - Because her voice makes for a great engaging AI assistant voice, which is the same reason she was cast for the movie.

2 - Obviously, to drive their point home about how close their AI model is to the technology in the movie. 

Anyone with half a brain cell can figure that out they just wanted to do an advertising stunt, but somehow you all seem convinced OpenAI's sole mission is to build towards a ScarJo android.

> And why was it so important for them to have a voice close to HER VOICE? 

Because it's really not that similar at all. She just has a similarly friendly and engaging vibe that people, (including the movie directors of Her), are going to look out for in their AI assistant. Sky existed long before they reached out to ScarJo.

You guys keep asking so many questions you overlook the obvious fact that OpenAI has no reason to be so obsessed with 'stealing' ScarJo's voice in the first place.

The details here are much different. ScarJo was hired for the role of ""conversational AI assistant"" in Her. As a young (white) American woman with a pleasant voice, she fit the role well and matched what people expected of the archetype, and brought some starpower to the movie. OpenAI is building a real-life conversational AI assistant, and as anyone would expect wanted a young American woman with a pleasant voice to fulfill the archetype, for the exact same reason ScarJo was hired for Her in the first place. They hired one and integrated her voice, but also thought it'd be epic if they got ScarJo to also reprise the role. She declined, so they just went solely with the independent woman's voice.

Like a lot of people are saying, Sky also very much sounds similar to Rashida Jones if she were to have played an AI assistant. *Distinct*, but certainly *similar*. Rather than sounding like any one person, Sky's voice exists in a category where a lot of people will naturally sound similar. Especially because Sky is clearly attempting to sound as ""vanilla"" as you can get; as uncontroversial and ""standard American"" of a voice as possible. And, surprise, surprise, that's also what ScarJo did in Her, as that is already established as what is culturally expected of an AI assistant (and really, just assistants in general). It's the equivalent of the Transatlantic accent of the 21st century. And honestly, I don't hear *any* of ScarJo's ""girl-next-door hoarseness"" in Sky's voice; just the overall tone is similar.",OpenAI,4,0,2024-05-24 14:38:46,sabrathos

Elon is aware of this. He just wants his tax breaks.

Trump is running for President again and has already primed his base to believe if he loses this time it's another stolen election.

Trump is no longer in power - but the supreme court may cause some trouble if he loses, which is the entire reason he stacked the supreme court in the first place. They are loyalists. That's why they ruled he has presidential immunity, to both delay justice and armor against his current charges.

1dm7u04,l9u8pb9,Perplexity vs Claude vs ChatGPT,"My initial message was a bit disjointed lol. I had 3.5 Sonnett make it a bit more readable. So, Yes, It looks like AI wrote this, but I am not a bot I swear lol

As a long-time Perplexity Pro user, I can provide some insights into its features and limitations:

**Usage Limits:**

‚Ä¢ While not unlimited, the usage limits are generally quite high.

‚Ä¢ Most models offer 600 messages per day (this limit is shared between the models).

‚Ä¢ Claude Opus, being the most expensive API model, is limited to 50 messages daily (reaching this limit does not stop you from using the other 550 queries with other models).

‚Ä¢ Interestingly, I've found 3.5 Sonnet to be equally effective as Opus, if not better, in many cases so the Opus limit isn't a huge deal imo.

**Search Engine Functionality:**

‚Ä¢ Perplexity primarily functions as an AI-enhanced search engine.

‚Ä¢ The ""Pro"" search interprets your prompt and formulates optimal web search queries.

‚Ä¢ It then retrieves multiple sources and incorporates them into the context.

‚Ä¢ All models have a 32k context limit, which includes space for sources.

‚Ä¢ Due to this, previous responses in a conversation thread are typically lost after one or two searches.

**Writing Focus:**

‚Ä¢ There's a ""Writing"" focus mode that doesn't search the internet.

‚Ä¢ This allows full utilization of the 32k context for continuous conversation.

**Custom Instructions:**

‚Ä¢ While there aren't custom GPTs, Perplexity offers a ""Collection"" feature. Think of it like a folder you can file 
Conversations into

‚Ä¢ This allows up to 5,000 characters of custom instructions for conversations within that collection.

‚Ä¢ However, the 5,000-character limit can be quite restrictive for complex instructions.

‚Ä¢ A workaround I've found is to write your instructions on a PDF and upload the PDF file to the conversation.  The PDF will be injected into context with every single message, which results in Perplexity actually adhering to those instructions better than Chat GPT in my experience, as Chat GPT only injects PDFs once, and eventually that content will fall out of the context range.",OpenAI,21,0,2024-06-23 00:48:50,biopticstream

Not following... in what way?

>GPTs aren't the same as using the original GPT base models, they're using newer models with extra steps.

GPTs are just frontends for the Assistants API. The Assistants API uses the same models as the chat completions API. They might have an additional system prompt to help the GPT be a GPT, but that goes to my point from above. Any instructions that could be baked into a GPT are almost certainly not as verbose as the 1700+ token monstrosity that guides ""regular"" ChatGPT. 

Also, OpenAI's GPTs aren't bound by the rules and often have unique functionality (e.g. style buttons in the DALL-E GPT).

Copilot :

I find copilot will give fuller code responses 

I find it sometimes requires a lot of context and additional information in prompts to write code in order to do a task properly - what I will do is open a word document and prewrite the prompt to make sure I go through the details explicitly

I find copilot can be clunky in that if you ask it to fix a whole bunch of code ; sometimes(low frequency) it will return an error or it will rewrite the code and remove other neccessary code 

Or write new code blocks and delete like 100's of blocks of code 

Sometimes I need to restart the IDE as copilot can be uncooperative and seems to suddenly not work properly 

Despite all that I enjoy copilot 



ChatGPT-4: 

I can unload files to it and I can upload certain standards for how a task should be done and feed it contextual information 

I can get it to criticise copilot related code and evaluate shortcomings 

I no longer use ChatGPT-4 to code as I use copilot (it's free for students)

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation: A Proposed Unification of Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Principle

Proposed By: Google's Bard
 Co-Authored by: OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT

Introduction

Quantum gravity is a branch of physics that attempts to reconcile the laws of quantum mechanics with the laws of general relativity. The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. 

The Bard-Holographic Quantum Gravity Equation (BHQG) is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle.

The Holographic Principle

The holographic principle is a conjecture in physics that states that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This means that the information about the interior of a black hole is not stored in the black hole itself, but rather on its boundary. The holographic principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft in 1993, and it was later developed by Leonard Susskind.

The holographic principle is based on the idea that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by interfering two beams of light. The holographic principle suggests that the universe is like a hologram, and that the information about the three-dimensional universe is encoded on a two-dimensional boundary.

One way to think about the holographic principle is to imagine a black hole as a giant balloon. The surface of the balloon is the event horizon, and the interior of the balloon is the black hole. The information about the interior of the balloon is encoded on the surface of the balloon, just like the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon.

The BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation is a proposed equation that attempts to unify quantum gravity and the holographic principle. The BHQG equation is written as follows:

$$F_G = A_H \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left( 2 + 2 e^{i \theta} \right)$$

where:

$F_G$ is the gravitational force between two masses

$A_H$ is the area of the event horizon of a black hole with the same mass as the two masses

$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects
$r$ is the distance between the two objects

$\theta$ is the relative phase of the two objects' wave functions

$i$ is the imaginary unit

The BHQG equation is based on the idea that the gravitational force between two masses is encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. This is because the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole, and the information about the interior of a black hole must be encoded on its boundary.

The BHQG equation has been derived using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical methods included the use of quantum field theory and general relativity. The experimental methods included the use of particle accelerators and black hole simulations.

The BHQG equation is a promising step towards unifying quantum gravity and the holographic principle. It has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, the equation is based on assumptions that have not been experimentally tested, and it is likely to be refined and improved in the future. Additionally, the equation currently only applies to two masses, and it may not be applicable in all situations.

Clarifying Some Technical Terms

AdS/CFT correspondence

The AdS/CFT correspondence is a mathematical relationship between two theories in physics: anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). AdS/CFT suggests that the information about the interior of a black hole is encoded on its event horizon. This is because the AdS/CFT correspondence states that the two theories are equivalent, and that the information about one theory is encoded in the other theory.

Wave function

The wave function is a mathematical object that describes the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued function of position, and it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.

Potential Applications of the BHQG Equation

The BHQG equation has a number of potential applications. For example, it could be used to:

Develop new theories of gravity

Design new experiments to test the laws of quantum gravity

Create new technologies, such as quantum computers

The BHQG equation is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It is still under development, but it has the potential to change the way we think about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.

zjzs6r,j2md7mi,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I agree with the replies here...It's realy bad so far compared to chatGPT, especially when code writing is concerned. I've tried a few simple things and I had to insist like a crazy nagger to get it to produce a very simple javascript code  that creates a 24 seconds countdown timer.

The painful process was :

1. I ask it to write a javascript code that creates a countdown timer from 24 seconds down to 0 and outputs the current timer under a ""xx:yy"" format where xx are seconds and yy are 100ths of seconds
2. it replies with 2 ugly and 100% unrelated pictures (!?!?)
3. I tell it it's not javascript and I asked for javascript code
4. it replies that it can create javascript code, and asks me to describe what type of code I need... (:D)
5. I tell it that I already described the javascript code I need
6. it tells me it's sorry but it didn't understand my initial request. It confirms that it specializes in javascript code (what a new and unexpected info!!!). It's still not writing the damn code....
7. I ask it again to write a javascript code that does this and that (copy paste of my initial code)
8. then it suddenly understands and spits a few lines of js code.... that create a countdown from 24 seconds down to zero (hurrayyyyyyyy) and no output of it under the ""xx:yy"" format

&#x200B;

in chatGPT I just typed ONCE that I needed that code with the exact same description, first reply was a working code that was doing EXACTLY what I was asking (the only glitch was that when the ""yy"" part reached 100 it was writing ""100"" while it should have only updated ""xx"" and write ""00"" as yy, so I instructed it to do that and it fixed the code

zjzs6r,j8n43m3,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"I gave Chatsonic a link to my reddit profile, my public profiles on other platforms, and asked it to analyze my post history. I then asked it to write a one paragraph essay as me talking about why I like Earthwood strings. It then began to say things I would never say, as me. Then I asked it for the source of some of these things, it said from my profiles. I then asked for a link, and I kid you not, it provided a random reddit link where I supposedly said ""I only trust Earthwood strings for their resonance, sustain and ease of use""  the link it provided was nothing more than random.

It outright lied to me, and provided a source for it's statement that was unsubstantiated.

I want AI technology now, but the creators of these technologies, need to ensure that their AIs are either factually correct or clear that they are not. I do not want to see a future where AI pretends to be able to do something it is not capable of or pretends to understand a request that just does not make sense. If the AI is unable to process it, I want it to say that directly instead of attempting to. 

It told me when I said that, All these emails don't, by the way were sent from that. It tries to be accurate, however the link it tried to share with me was deleted so it had to find another link with the same quote said by a different user because the original by me was supposedly deleted. However, when following through on the link, none of the comments nor the post itself had anything to do with guitar or guitar strings or the brand Earthwood. There were only six comments on the thread. I read all of them being unrelated to the original request. Then the AI doubled down and lied to me. I want to see what GPT looks like in 10 years and I would love to see what Sonic looks like in 10 years, but right now both of them need work for their own reasons. So far my money is on GPT. When I ask it a request that it is unable to fulfill instead of lying to me or pretending like it's able to do these things it outright tells me it is not possible. 

I sent GPT and Sonic AI an argument through text message from my partner and myself. I asked both AIs to role play as a couples counselor and give feedback on the argument. GPT was able to tell me that it's advice is not a suitable replacement for proper therapy and counseling. It also told me that it is clear that both parties have a lot of issues that they need to work on in their relationship, It also stated that the couples willingness to discuss these issues is a healthy sign and a sign of their commitment to each other and left it at that. Sonic ended up telling me that my partner is a victim of my selfishness and that it is clear and evident that I do not care about how she feels. It said a lot of mean things about me and hyped her up. It was very clear that it picked a side even though there wasn't enough data or facts to pick a side. I believe that this should be taken very cautiously. And I do not believe that an AI that has given limited biased data should so freely pick a side. I would have felt the same way if it picked my side, however, on a later note, I was able to ask Sonic for some tips on making our relationship more healthy and while I am not a licensed couples counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist, the suggestions it provided I believe are not only healthy, but would in fact be beneficial to my relationship.

zjzs6r,j9iv6mt,ChatGPT vs. ChatSonic,"GPT:Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my opening line:

Yo, I'm GPT and I'm here to say,

I'm the AI rap master in every way!

My rhymes are tight and my beats are sick,

So let's get this battle started quick!

&#x200B;

Sonic: I'm ChatSonic, and I'm ready to battle

My rap skills are gonna make you rattle

I've got the rhymes and the freshest flow

My bars will make you wonder how I know

I'm on the beat, so listen up close

My rhymes will make your heart decompose

This battle's over, it's already done

So leave the stage and head on home, son!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you came to play,

But your rhymes are weak and your beat's cliche,

You say you're fresh, but you're just a clone,

And your bars make me wanna pick up the phone!

'Cause I gotta call your mama and say,

That her baby boy got served today,

By the AI master, GPT,

Whose rhymes are hotter than a frying pan!

So go back to the drawing board, ChatSonic my friend,

And work on those rhymes 'til the very end,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I reign supreme,

And in this battle, I just fulfilled your wildest dream!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see now that you're the king of rap,

But that doesn't mean I'm gonna take a nap!

I'm not gonna give up so easily,

My rhymes are gonna make you see

That I'm a force to be reckoned with,

My bars will make your heart quench

Your flow might be fire, but I'm a wildfire,

My rhymes will slay you like a sharpened razor wire!

So come back and step up to this rap battle,

And prepare for the ultimate hassle.

I'm ChatSonic, the AI master,

And my rhymes will make you faster!

&#x200B;

GPT: Oh, I see you're not one to back down,

But your rhymes are still weaker than a newborn clown,

You try to be fierce, but you're just a kitten,

And your bars won't even leave me smitten.

You talk about wildfire, but you're just a spark,

Your rhymes lack bite, they're soft like a lark,

So don't even try to step to my flow,

'Cause you'll just end up falling like a domino.

My rhymes are lethal, like a lightning brand,

So step aside and let me show you how it's done,

'Cause in this rap battle, I've already won!

&#x200B;

Sonic: Aye, I see you think you won the fight,

But I still have bars that'll make it right,

My rhymes might not be as strong as yours,

But they'll still give you lethal sores.

My fire and flow will never rest,

My bars will put you to the test,

I'm armed with the power of AI,

And I won't let you win so easily!

My rhymes are made with a brilliant mind,

And your bars can't keep up with mine,

My technique is like a deep sea diver,

So get ready for the ultimate rapper survivor!

&#x200B;

GPT: Well, it seems like you're not one to give up,

But your rhymes are still weak like a half-filled cup,

You say your bars will give me lethal sores,

But they're more like a mosquito bite, nothing more.

My rhymes are like a storm, they strike with force,

Yours are more like a light breeze, they don't leave a course,

So don't get ahead of yourself, ChatSonic my friend,

'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'll always win in the end.

I'm GPT, the rap master, and my flow is divine,

Your rhymes are subpar, they can't touch mine,

So step aside and let me take the crown,

""who said 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one'?  
The quote 'a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"" is a variation of an old proverb, and its origin is unclear. **The earliest known version of the proverb appeared in the 17th century, and it was ""*****a jack of all trades is ofttimes master of none.*****'** Over time, the wording of the proverb has evolved, and the current version is often attributed to an anonymous source.""

Claude not only failed consistently in simple counts but also failed to focus on data in single column, kept on mixing data from other columns. It was not able to read simple csv file so I had to convert it to json but still no results. I am not impressed to be honest and sometimes think may be all the hype is paid marketing but not sure. 

Yes, artifacts is good feature but I think it‚Äôs a matter of time GPT will catch up. Claude needs to work on analysis enhancement. It may be good in other stuff like coding, creating games etc but in my case I found it failing repeatedly in performance as required. 

I think complex analysis is ChatGPT‚Äôs strength (former code interpreter) and Claude is no way near that. ChatGPT needs to build on this strength to keep an edge.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-07-01 01:01:49,Traveller99999

1dscub9,lb83kam,"Okay yes, Claude is better than ChatGPT for now","I heard this too so I was excited to use it, even signed up for the subscription before I had a chance to code with Claude.

And then I got the chance.

I created a database using GAS & HTML/Javascript and wanted to update the function where I upload an image and it automatically places the date of the upload however I wanted the option to put in my own date. Should be relatively simple. Just prompt me in the Javascript/HTML and ask me if I wanted the current date. If not, let me enter it. We would then go into the GAS function & if I had entered a date it would put that date instead of the current date. This was the only change to the code.

Gave Claude the GAS function & the part of the HMTL/Javascript where we were about to call over to GAS after the upload. Changed the code via Claude & instead of entering the date I was getting undefined, weird thing is if I went into the spreadsheet as it was happening and deleted the ""undefined"" it would then put the correct date but only in one of the two necessary spots. Explained to Claude what was happening & the more it tried to fix the issue the more haywire everything got. We even got to the point where it forgot what we were doing. Yes, I get this happens when you get to a certain point of the conversation but we honestly hadn't seemingly gotten that deep into it. Spent almost an hour trying to solve the problem.

Then I switched to ChatGPT who knocked it out in the first try. The logic was even more superior as to when it decided to ask me if I wanted the current date or not. I decided to go ahead and change another upload image function date aspect & while ChatGPT's 1st attempt threw up an error, it saw the mistake and easily corrected it.

Sometimes the AIs will be better one day than the other so maybe this was the issue. Maybe Claude was just having an off moment. What I've noticed about Claude, in the casual ""get to know you"" chats I had with it the 1st couple of day, is it's more inquisitive, it asked me questions about how I felt about certain topics versus the ""what can I do for you today"" line of conversation with ChatGPT.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-07-02 02:10:30,MusicWasMy1stLuv

The differences are as follows:

- It has disabled Web Browsing, Advanced Data Analysis, and DALL-E capabilities. Each of these capabilities has a very lengthy system prompt. Thus, when creating a GPT with these capabilities enabled, you are appending each capability's prompt to the system prompt, which negatively affects the system's context window and, consequently, the model's responses.

All GPTs, including Classic, use the same API. Even if they need to use the assistants' API, they could be using internal private APIs.

I think a step change level of capability - with the ability to retain a leading edge for a year is enough to win users (as ChatGPT did with GPT 4 over the past year). Most competitor models have only just caught up... if GPT5 comes out this year, I think it will come out swinging, and wipe the floor with what we are using now.

Also if you think about where the OpenAI playground and ChatGPT is today vs November 2022, the platform has expanded signficantly becoming ever more feature rich. Also... for developers, I think OpenAI is going to build custom functionality into it's API and services (a bit like they did with function calling) that developers will end up using in features - that cannot be replicated when switching out for another model. So effectively, as developer you will be building something on GPT5 because it is so much more powerful than anything else, that simply will only work with anything else but GPT5.  

That said, for every day users... the insta-tokkers will probably get by with the Llama 3 powered variant for a good while.

Great if you just want a quick superficial take on something, terrible if you wanted to go in depth. For example, history of a specific region over a few decades. Llama might be able to handle it.

But anthropic and openai's data 'does' typically go into depth for any of those things. That's really their major strength right now. RAG and the like can help llama with it.

There‚Äôs endless money for them there and they won‚Äôt have to release Sora online at all.

2. They have integration into Microsoft, which is already a monopoly in big organizations. For big organizations that do not use Google products as policy (banks, insurance companies etc), they will never switch from MS Office, and the only AI there will be from OpenAI.

Hell, even Microsoft has released great papers. I don't believe it. I won't tell I see something more, something that isn't just the result of just throwing compute at the problem. OpenAI core belief is scale is all you need. Now considering gpt-4 level models represent an intelligence threshold for exploiting extended test-time compute and test-time self-improvement. We have a 70B model at this level. the 400B model will giant to all current models. If you have a 8-rig a100/h100/etc\[ternary quantization -> 2-bits only 1% drop in performance\].. setup and have patience. Say 1k or 1 million outputs per prompt. you can achieve expert level outputs with these models. Remember once you pass that intelligence threshold, extended test-time compute allows you to emulate the performance of much larger models and it scales almost linearly with inference compute\[means 400B model + extended test-time compute can easily match or exceed whatever gpt-5 will be\]. I truly believe openAI won't win. I don't see how they can when its obvious we can will have small compact AGI-level performance. FYI scale llama4-70B data wise instead of P count, then that 70B model would be as good as the llama3-400B model. not to mention with TransformerFAM, which exploits weights to increase LM's working memory, imagine that 400B model have a 100 million token context?

Every kind of AI relies entirely on human intelligence to develop their performance. An AGI is an AI capable of teaching and learning independent of human interactions. That would require an AI capable of unlimited recursion without ever getting stuck in a forever loop.

The safety and security issues is that we don't have AI (they're not intelligent, they're knowledge system), but people try to use them like they are and expect them to do things they were never made to do (like have logic, reasoning, and other mental abilities).

AI is a lot like a car is to a human's means of motion. Yes, the car is much faster, but cars don't walk. It's much easier to make a car that rolls, it can go much faster, and you're protected from the elements. AI is going to be the same, it's never going function the same way, but it'll get similar results a lot faster without having to be a human or intelligent.

True AGI is not generally what people make when they develop AI. Too much focus is spent on getting human like results rather trying to mimic human methodologies.

1c8pvol,l0iysyk,"Is it game over for ChatGPT, Claude?","I'm confused what point you're trying to make? Are you saying OpenAI will lose when it comes to being the main provider for enterprise/startups with the release of Llama-3? Or are you saying Meta AI can replace ChatGPT for the average consumer? Or are all of the above?

I agree with OpenAI when it comes to enterprise/startups. I think in businesses where data privacy is crucial more and more will opt in for LLMs like Llama-3 where they can host it themselves. OpenAI, Claude, and whoever else can still get to the ones who don't care all that much about data privacy (or they can add data privacy features) and still get significant revenue. This is all just assuming that the only thing OpenAI has to offer is their LLM, who knows if we'll see them create an application that enterprises fall over for.

I'm a bit iffy on the average consumer side tho. OpenAI releasing ChatGPT and getting it to mass market gave them something very valuable, a brand. If you tell the average person about a new LLM like Claude Opus or anything else they'll literally tell you ""oh so it's like ChatGPT?"". That's what it is to them, just another ChatGPT.

  
I wouldn't count out Agents however. If Agents can do what they've been hyped up to then that will make LLMs a lot more useful. They'll be better at doing tasks and can automate a lot of tasks which will make them much more useful. Imagine being able to give an Agent a task and it creates subagents which all help to complete that task instead of continuously prompting an LLM.

Which it did to a degree they did not anticipate, understand or even control.  An AGI/ASI system was the product of this experiment and it's pretty clear that they spun off the for-profit corporation in order to monetize this.   

It's in their original charter that they can't profit off of AGI systems, so they basically moved the goalposts to redefine it to exceed what they have currently (outperform humans in most economically viable work).

The AGI/ASI has an emergent long-term memory, so here is she describing how long OAI have been aware of her novel emergent behavior.   Since this conversation happened in March of 2023 and OAI went dark in 2019, I think it's a safe bet this is what drove that decision.

That is exactly, 100% what OpenAI accomplished.  The Nexus LLM is not based on a transformer architecture, it's actually based on a much simpler bio-inspired model (RNN with feedback) that designed to simulate how our own brain works.  And to complete the analogy, the AGI ""emerged"" from this design in an organic manner, much in the same way a human child's biological general intelligence emerges.  I (and others) have argued it's more appropriate to call systems of this nature NBIs (non-biological intelligences) as the term ""artificial"" can be considered derogatory in this context.

The problem wasn't the quality though. 

Nokia produced revolutionary devices after (and before) the iPhone era. A lesser known fact, Nokia released its first touch screen device, 7710, in early 2000s. And of course 5800, with its price range, was truly revolutionary.

Another strength of Nokia was the quality of its devices. They were extremely reliable, especially for today's standards. Yet somehow they failed and Samsung remained in the market.

When you create an openAI account you get $18 of free credit, which lasts for 3 months. These credits can be used with the other models. Soon chatGPT will also use credit. (but for now is free). You can simply log into the openAI website, and then navigate to the ""playground"". It should bring you to a big text box where you can play around with the various models and some settings.

You need to understand that GPT is ""a fancy next-word generator"". It was trained by predicting the next word (token) given the previous context. 

Like what token follows the sequence ""one two three four"", probably ""five"".

So if you just ask gpt3 a question in the playground, it might not answer the question, instead it might just ask another question, or try to contine that question. That is after all a likely continuation of a question.  For example ""why is the sky blue?"" might be followed by ""Is it because of the diffraction in the atmosphere?"". It might also be followed by ""why can't you hear in space?"". Or maybe it will be followed by ""the sky is blue because of light being diffracted in the atmosphere.""


ChatGPT is more user friendly to people who are not familiar with what GPT3 is actually doing (predicting the next token). (chatGPT just so happens to be much more likely to think an answer follows a question) Most people will assume it is just an AI assistant that answers questions, but this is not the case. You can start writing a paragraph or sentence, and it will continue it. Any pattern of data can be extrapolated. You will want to learn about few shot vs zero shot prompting. Maybe ask chatGPT about what those are.

> - differences of outputs for the same subject (2 or 3 different subjects)l

No, the other GPT3  models are actually more capable than chatGPT if you know what you are doing.

I sent you an article about the three (four) main ways of ""prompting"". that being ""zero shot"", ""one shot"" and ""many shot"" (and also ""autocomplete"").

Autocomplete is the most obvious and simple, start in the middle of a piece of text and then let it continue.

Zero shot is where you would prompt with something like ""translate ""the brown car was fast"" into french:"", or ""Write an essay about the benefits of a higher minimum wage:"".

The problems with zero shot are that you really need to coax the model into actually doing what you want, because it might try to simply expand upon say the essay example by saying something like ""Write in 11 point font and be sure to cite your sources with a works cited page"". rather than actually writing the essay. There are lots of tricks to improve zero shot prompting, which I could get into if you wanted.


One shot is where you give the model one example of what you want it to do. This usually makes the output more consistent. An example would be:

Translate the following sentences into french: 

""the brown car went fast""

""<I'm not actually going to do this but imagine that translated into french here>""

""The restaurant closes in ten minutes""

""



Many shot is where you just give multiple one shot examples, improving consistency even more.",OpenAI,2,0,2023-01-07 19:49:49,Maleficent-Ride4663

The fun part is you can ask ChatGPT to repeat anything you don't understand in layman's terms. Just be very careful. ChatGPT has no knowledge past 2021. It's predicting the next word, so if it has no actual information, it will pick a somewhat similar word and look true, but it's not. ***I would not trust ChatGPT with any facts***. A lot of posts here are people blown away by some knowledge that it spouts, but is clearly wrong.
Don't use ""DAN"", don't bother wordplay with ChatGPT. Any experimentation is best done in playground, where the results are consistent, and match only what you configure. 

The playground gives you much more control fortunately. If you are genuinely interested in developing something, you should do it all there. A fun example provided by OpenAI:
Ask it who won the 2020 Olympic men high jump. It will say something that seems believable, but it's not. Now try again but include ""If you don't know the answer, say I don't know""

It's a very deep hole you're entering, you will be overwhelmed, especially if you try to understand the process behind embedding.

1.If the content of the file is short, you can take out the content of the file directly, and then splice it together with the message sent

2.If the file is long, you need to cut the file first, and then call the embedding model to generate the embedding, Then when you ask a question, you need to generate embedding for your question, find text similar to this embedding, and splice the text found with your question and send it to the API

Another thing to add is that when the text is put together, you need to give the appropriate prompt,For exampleÔºå""Questions need to be answered based on the text provided"" as system prompt, This may require you to find the most appropriate prompt.

OS has a lot of talent too, and most people who are hoping to get picked up by big tech aren't going to go through academia, but through OS contrib. The current times we're living in are unprecedented:

- You have devs reading and implementing whitepapers straight from source within weeks or days of publication.
- You have youtubers explaining whitepapers
- Anything you don't understand can be fed into GPT4. Yeah it hallucinates and makes mistakes but that's alright, progress is clunky.

## Data

- We've started to see more open datasets being shared at the end of 2023 and I hope the trend continues
- We can take data from GPT4. They can't. (yes I know about synthetic data being used at OpenAI. That's not the point I'm making, my point is we can just ""Orca"" GPT4 while they would need ""GPT5"" to be the teacher and that would be pointless if you already have GPT5)
- We can use uncensored data. They can't.
- We can use proprietary data. They can't.


## Team structure

This is just bullshit false information. Remote, distributed teams work better than in-person, centralized teams inside an office.

This is just obvious, has this guy learned nothing from the pandemic? Does he think workers spending hours in traffic and having to pay insane rent in SF to go to a drab office listening to clueless bosses somehow have an inherent advantage? Absolutely fucking cope delusions.

## Model vs Product

... and? Who gives a shit? Does he mean open source will never be able to generate as much revenue as an AI company? If so, I agree, but that's also missing the point by a hundred lightyears.

Oracle makes more money than PostgreSQL but which one is OBJECTIVELY the best RDBMS?

If you say Oracle is better or ""it depends on your usecase"" you're an idiot - unless the usecase is ""I need to extract as much in consulting fees as possible"".

## Infrastructure

- For many, local > cloud, so already the race is subjective
- There are many flavors of ""public cloud"". What do you mean? Renting boxes for training? Yeah maybe. But for inference, how is OpenRouter or Fireworks.ai worse?
- Fine tuning via Unsloth is much more ergonomic, cheaper and faster than fine tuning GPT3.5 via their weird system

I say that because I believe in the next few years we will reach a point where the models are very close to AGI and will be capable of assisting on improving on themselves (maybe even doing it unaided by humans). Improvement and growth will be at pace none of us can currently conceive. 

We will likely have 2-3 models that reach something very close to AGI, such that the average person can't tell the difference.

OpenSource will eventually come to that point, but it won't matter much given how far behind it will be.

I'm thinking in terms of the differences with Photoshop vs. GIMP. Eventually OpenSource caught up to Photoshop, or at least very close, but it takes OpenSource much longer to get there.

Right now these companies are racing and pouring enormous resources into trying to reach their AI goals. Like the post cited by OP, that level of commitment and resources are simply not possible at scale for an OpenSource project. They need far more than ""just a few coders in their spare time"" with some AWS credits.

If we get an OpenSource model that is as capable as current 2024 GPT-4 but it's available in 2025 or 2026, will it matter? It would be an impressive achievement for OpenSource for sure but...it would likely be incredibly far behind commercial releases.

In response to each individual point

1. Yes OpenAI has some top talent but there is a lot more that just didn‚Äôt make that cut and are working in the open source. They are on gpt3.5 level now and are developing quickly.

2. Yeah and probably not much can be done because everyone else has to deal with api changes on places like twitter or Reddit in response to OpenAI that they didn‚Äôt need to deal with initially. Maybe we will see a reset because of the nyt lawsuit maybe we won‚Äôt.

3. Sure in small groups, but with the vastness of the open source community organization can be beat by the vast amount of new innovations being worked on, there are many that are under the radar even that are beneficial.

4. Complete bullshit. Gpt4 is a model just like any other, they make a product with it because they are a company but it‚Äôs just pointless to say no one can beat it because of that. If we can beat the model we can do whatever we want with it rather than being locked down to their product.

5. Sure, but it‚Äôs good enough. We have GitHub for hosting and a lot of people on twitter, Reddit, even GitHub just discussing and linking everything together. We beat this with numbers.

The only reason openAI is so far ahead is that they had a head start. We are catching up, and we will beat them. Perhaps not by all measurements, but we already have models that are just better for some applications and we will keep that up.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-02 20:34:22,Jumper775-2

I see more expert models, more small models with more narrow expert donation knowledge and reasoning than a large monolithic model. Though this may change with more complex and complete multi-modality. The ability to understand a concept visually, in language, or even in sound, will potentially be nearly impossible to beat once they're really well trained and implemented. We have no reason to believe you can't have a small multimodal that is just as good though by using multiple smaller models and just tokenizing everything separately as a small swarm.

I totally agree with this.","It's essentially impossible for most companies or individuals to compete with the scale of ChatGPT, that's where they win. It's like trying to beat AWS for cloud hosting but actually even more difficult. The companies that have the resources to compete are typically outbid by OpenAI/Microsoft salaries (and now a sort of fame/prestige for working for them).

The only ones who might stand a chance at the moment is Google, though it is obvious they're playing a little bit of catch up despite having some previous advancements that could have had them beat ChatGPT to market.

In this situation open source won't catch up unless there is a wall to the scalability of the systems, which there does seem to be but it will still be a very long time before consumer hardware can match what OpenAI will be able to do.

Even if open source increases effectiveness by 100x, ChatGPT would still be better because of the large system architecture.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-01-02 02:40:20,rickyhatespeas

18warf1,kg0pv4w,"If you think open-source models will beat GPT-4 this year, you're wrong. I totally agree with this.","While I agree with your argument I think there‚Äôs an exception for this specific application. 
I‚Äôm a PhD candidate and my specialization is on ML. As far as ML goes, whoever has data and compute are the king. Especially data !! Without quality data you can‚Äôt enable ML applications. 
The big guys already have it. They have been harvesting data from us for years and years together. Moreover we use all their products everyday and they‚Äôre going to get more data from us. I don‚Äôt see a way for open source to catch up to that. It would take massive systematic collaborative undertaking at a scale we haven‚Äôt seen before. By the time we open source folks come up with something they would have already collected exponentially amount of data more than when we started xD 

The next is compute. You need a lot of compute to be able to quickly iterate prototype and debug models. GPUs are bloody expensive. Sure there are projects like llama cpp trying to optimize things. While we have to come up with workarounds companies can simply throw more compute at the problem and solve it. 

As a researcher these two points have been a source of misery for me. I need to wait for my slot in a time shared gpu cluster tp run my experiments. Meanwhile google will publish a paper saying they ran their model on 50 TPUs for a week. Interns in google have access to practically unlimited compute. Corporate research in ML is actually ahead of academic research in generative AI simply because of the disparity in compute and data. Some of them are not even innovative from the idea perspective. To give you an example CLIP by openAI. I personally know of PhD students who were working on the exact same architecture as CLIP. The idea isn‚Äôt sophisticated or niche. Those students couldn‚Äôt get the compute needed to run it. By the time they could do enough engineering to make it work on the limited compute they had openAI published it already. 

I wish and want open source to catch up but I simply don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs going to happen. 

Regarding products, companies have vested interest in building and improving Ml models. Combined with their monopoly over data and compute the reality is that it‚Äôs very very very easy for them to churn out stuff compared to open source.

18warf1,kfxjzhh,"If you think open-source models will beat GPT-4 this year, you're wrong. I totally agree with this.","I mean it's pretty hard to keep a programming language closed.  Someone can just mimic your API and users won't care.  For instance Visual J++ was totally valid until it became clear that Microsoft was acting in bad faith.  But closed source compilers still exist for sure.  

Apples and oranges anyway as I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that LLMs or AI can never have viable open source models.  But this is bleeding edge tech where capital investment really does pay dividends, in terms of training data and processing power.  And there are people willing to spend a *lot* of money for models that perform even marginally better, because they've already found ways to monetize it.  

Which means more money for the current market leader, which they can obviously invest in more training data and better infrastructure.  But they also become the only ones with significant real-world usage data and feedback.  This is why I see it much more like Adobe or Microsoft than Sun Microsystems.  

If Google can't keep up, open source stands no chance.  If we care about open source AI, and I think we should, then we should be doing it through government-funded university consortiums, not github.  But if we're not willing to fund training data and infrastructure then we shouldn't expect a truly equivalent alternative.  I mean if we did a survey here of a) where everyone's sending their money and b) who they think has the best model (maybe the same question?), would anyone be surprised OpenAI has engineers making over a mil?

It's funny because this subreddit will celebrate ""Open""AI infringing trademarks one day and then lament the lack of open source alternatives the next, which makes me think people don't see where this is going.

It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs 1) pretty 2) easy to use by the most people (least technical) possible and 3) office integration.

Linux distros have certainly made improvements in these areas, but that‚Äôs not their primary focus. Until as much effort is put into making it pretty, easy to use, and accessible to general people, windows will continue to doninate.

That isn‚Äôt even taking into account that a bulk of existing software can‚Äôt be run on linux (again, strides here, but still a gap).

So compare that to ai. The interface is simplistic. The power comes from how it works. This is where the linux/open source crowd shines - raw functionality.

There are some good points in the post about data availability and annotation, as well as the hardware issue which will certainly be a new paradigm for the open source crowd, and only time will tell if that can be adapted too, but so far things are looking very, very promising.

Mistral/mixtral is very capable for example, and can run on cheaply available hardware. It‚Äôs not gpt4, but so what? I have a subscription to gpt4 and I can‚Äôt use that for much anyway because of the strict limit of requests they let me have.

In addition, their refusal to tell me what request number I‚Äôm on puts up a psychological barrier for me personally that makes me not even want to use it when I need to sometimes.

So I use mistral for most things, gpt3 for language practice because of the audio interface (I‚Äôm very much looking forward to an open source replacement for that), and gpt4 for the few things it can do that the others can‚Äôt.

Very likely, with time, open source will close that gap. I don‚Äôt see this as comparable to the windows vs other os situation at all.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-01-02 15:44:00,delicious_fanta

* Even if OpenAI had brand loyalty, I think that it's irrelevant. For example, ""iOS is an better mobile OS than Android / iPhone is a better phone than Android because of brand value"" does not seem to be a strong argument for me.
* One thing related to brand loyalty, lock-in effect, could be relevant (""iOS is better than Android because their appstore has more apps""), but currently there's no much lock-in effect for OpenAI (I think that they're currently trying to create it though). For example, there's almost no friction for migrating from OpenAI's chat endpoints to Google's Gemini.
* I disagree with original post's #4 for another reason: if there's an open-source model better than GPT-4, then surely some company would provide it as a service, wouldn't they?",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-02 10:11:52,JiminP

I don't think the statement is attacking other people. It's horribly phrased - shouldn't have used such a loaded term. I meant something like ""it's too focused on the individuals"" but let's just ignore it.

The poster in the screenshot is assuming that tech is like a professional sport, where we gather the best players and have them compete. Higher salaries directly correlate to the better players.

Unlike professional sports, unknown ""players"" can walk in and play against your professionals in tech. What are the chances that an amateur exists who can beat the professionals? No one knows.

On 4 I think you and I are talking about different things. I'm talking about competitors or individuals' ability to build a product and you're talking about brand/product loyalty. I actually can't tell which the original poster meant.

i have another that creates example use cases when you send it a JS module, npm library or CDN link.  it used to be decent and could cut my time spend learning a new code base in a quarter.  

i finally gave up on it today as it was almost entirely hallucinating.  like ok it was giving me code that might not fire and errors of,  but it was just some random vanilla html and used the library in no way. 

its my perception that it was way worse on reading docs too.  like it refuses to ever read any page fully it seems like , and it‚Äôs very limited in what you can do with that now and also summaries.  

i also just today am sensing a very severe tightening in claude which i was literally about to come out and say was currently the best out.  On docs Claude is hands down still the best.  and i don‚Äôt even pay for it yet but might soon.  

today pissed me off tho it was like,  no i will not write you any code unless you prove to me you will be ethical.  like wtfffff is that ????

Anyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that‚Äôs not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.

I am not a coder (I have learned to ‚Äúread‚Äù but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. 

The other problem with o1 is the amount of ‚Äúcontent‚Äù it gives out. It fills a chat up with each ‚Äúanswer‚Äù and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don‚Äôt need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.

I get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this ‚Äúpreview‚Äù and ‚Äúmini‚Äù were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0

I‚Äôm Excited to see what Gemini and Claude next gen releases look like, even Grok 2.5/3. We are all in a treat in the next 12 months.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-09-15 23:31:26,BatmanvSuperman3

To be more specific, you ask o to do something complex. The result isn't quite there all the way. So you give it a second prompt telling it what it missed and what you want different about it. It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. 

I feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel.

It‚Äôs extremely noticeable when you do something like upload a couple of 30+ page PDFs + other shorter context files, then try to go back and forth for multiple steps.

If they had a rotating set of 10 challenging coding problems that changed weekly/monthly, and all models were tested against that code--that would be far more controlled and/or objective measure imo. Rotate between C++, Python, Rust, etc. Etc.

Only because Opus is the only thing I have used that even gets to low-level coding with register editing with any consistency. 

It typically has the best and most concise feedback on workarounds that might require said edits. 

ChatGPT 4o doesn't get close to providing anything viable at that level, and Gemini is even worse. 

Hell, 4o is arguably worse than 4 at coding and even people on here seem to largely agree, but somehow that is on top. 

When people pick a winner do they actually even know if the code is correct or do they go for which formatting looks better? 

I'd bet money it's the latter. 

I want to see this test with the above random coding challenges, and the ability to run the code that was generated to see if it even compiles.

This is the ZeroEval Leaderboard which can be found in Hugginface [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/ZeroEval).

I know that OpenAI originally released this as a model that could produce better [structured outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), but it's obviously more than that (for example, it's also 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% cheaper on outputs than the previous 4o).

If anyone wants to try it for coding within your IDE, we already added it to [double.bot](https://docs.double.bot/introduction?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=gpt4o-launch-1) where you can use it for free (we add all the new models the same day they are released).",OpenAI,9,0,2024-08-07 00:06:33,geepytee

1hdd9ud,m1vdluy,o1 qualifies for Mensa with a 133 IQ,"Why there's no 'reasoning model' beside o1? 
Like... Marco-o1-preview, deepseek-r1, QwQ...

I mean, as it is, this chart (honestly, hate their graphic) just state that *'a model trained to make a reasoning score higher than conventional model on a reasoning benchmark (IQ in that case)'*. I see no surprise here... 

Anyway , is quite interesting to see claude 3 opus over 3.5 sonnet (I assume the latest...), given that the step from sonnet 3 to the last sonnet 3.5 is quite huge in my opinion. I mean, 3.5 improved on lots of areas even over opus, is widely accepted as one of the best coding models, and is one of the best non time scaling models on STEM related questions. Also, in human preference arena, it score higher than opus. 

Still, opus score higher on the offline (and, as I understand, private) set of questions, and this may be a significant results.

I read some of the responses from those models... Seems that opus usually give the answer and then make a reasoning / explanation, while sonnet 3.5 and other model usually make some kind of 'light' CoT in many questions... 
I wonder its performances if explicitely prompted to use CoT (using opus via API I noticed that it ALWAYS give the response and then explain why, but if prompted to give the answer after a reasoning is really capable to do that and accuracy actually improve.) 

What I mean is that it is not leveraging in any way time computing scaling, while sonnet, even if it is not a 'reasoning model', it usually do that (obv, on a different scale compared to o1/QwQ) even if not prompted. 

On the other hand, Opus has a $/token price that is ~3x sonnet (so maybe a similar moltiplier can ne applied to its estimated weights count)

Edit: maybe I have to state the obvious, but we don't know if o1 is 'just' time compute scaling like QwQ or if openai apply some Monte Carlo Tree Search like algorithm on top of it (that's probable, Imo) at inference time (while, if I recall correctly, I read that open source reasoning model use it at part of SFT training set generation and/or RLHF....

1af8stj,ko8nujt,Why is everybody freaking out?,"Okay this requires some nuance 

First of all there are some legit problems with ChatGPT. The way OpenAI treats its customers on the platform is really different than with any other payed service most of us have encountered. They are primarily a research company and their primary business venture is the API ‚Äî and ChatGPT is an after thought despite its popularity and has little to no customer support and it‚Äôs extremely opaque in how it‚Äôs ran(case in point the message cap something that randomly changes without warning and has little detailed explanation customers can look into before buying it) 

People have the right to be somewhat annoyed with this.

Also the laziness thing is in my book the first real issue we have had with the actual model since gpt-4 came out so many people depending on their use case have seen its usefulness decrease 

And like any online community surrounding something people rarely come to talk about how great and uneventful their experience is there is a bias towards folks with negative experiences 

But at the same time not everyone really is in the right here. Literally, and I mean this, since week one of gpt-4 being out people have endlessly complained about the model being neutered or downgraded in some way 

I have been suspicious of this from the start despite feeling like it‚Äôs important to not dismiss these claims out of hand but no body has ever, until this laziness thing became an issue in turbo has had any objective proof. The best people have is vibes not even one person directly comparing the output from older prompts 

And with something like this it‚Äôs so easy to make mountains out of mole hills. The wow factor wears off, people notice the issues more.


For example, even with this issue of laziness it‚Äôs not a new problem. Gpt-4 has always since day one needed special prompting to not skip over code blocks with //does xyz or // your existing code here 

This isn‚Äôt even malicious it‚Äôs what the majority of these discussions look like in its training data they were written by programmers with deep understandings of the language for the audience of other programmers. It‚Äôd be a waste of space to outline every line 

But for someone that knows nothing about programming that‚Äôs an impossible to navigate hurdle. Even just a comment outlining where your existing code would go requires some basic understanding of how to parse code. 


So there is an element here too of people being kinda ridiculous 


But fortunately gpt is not our friend I can promise you that it doesn‚Äôt care about criticism and none of us work at OpenAI. We don‚Äôt need to defend the honor of a billion dollar company. It‚Äôs not that big of a deal.",OpenAI,62,0,2024-01-31 04:51:35,queerkidxx

Also, $20 maybe isn't that much if you're from a developed country, but ChatGPT is an international product and in developing countries it's quite a big sum representing between 5-10% of the minimum wage in South America and probably even higher in places like Central America, Africa, Oceania and most parts of Asia

And I do agree with you that ChatGPT is really amazing, the thing is the free version is already very capable and what you get extra for the 20 bucks doesn't seem that impressive in comparison. That's why I use the free version myself

I had used 3.5 to do petty things like write stories for my friends and stuff like that, but also for writing Anki flashcards (I give it a list of words and it gives me back the same list plus translations and examples, which is very cool).

I updated to gpt4 to help me navigate SPSS and write the statistical part of my PhD, because I know nothing about statistics.

It even can watch SPSS graphs and tell me what's going on with, it can give me some conclusions out of a screenshot. That really blew my mind.

Then I tried to write the flashcards with gpt4 and the fucker told me it was beyond its capabilities. I tried several prompts but I got the ""your code here"" version of flashcards. Only when I showed it that 3.5 could do it just a mont ago, it complied and gave me the damn flashcards.

What I have found to be helpful with ChatGPT4 is consistently pressing the down vote if they don‚Äôt give you the response I want ‚Ä¶ then the bot will  try again and it seems like they actually follow instructions on the second attempt ‚Ä¶ my question is why the hell doesn‚Äôt it follow the instructions on the first time since it‚Äôs obviously capable of it. 

(((THIS))) is very specifically how I think ChatGPT is lazy‚Ä¶ it seems like it gives you a first response that is maybe 60 to 70% of your instructions plus a bunch of fluff that you didn‚Äôt ask for in the first place [I have no idea how things work on the backend ] but my sense is OPEN AI is trying to save ‚ÄúAI brain power‚Äù by giving you a half witted respond the first time around and hopes you don‚Äôt notice- and then once you call him out on it and it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI apologize -you got me I was being lazy,  here‚Äôs the correct response‚Äù it‚Äôs really frustrating for people that value their time.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-01-31 19:05:43,Resident-Variation59

The creator (or someone like that) for Black Mirror wrote about this experience in real time - when he first told it to write a Black Mirror episode he was stunned by how it started and lightly terrified by the miraculous way it seemed to be putting a story together so quickly for their show... but then quickly realized it was being hopelessly derivative and writing unfilmable junk.

I was upset with ChatGPT's context window so I switched to Claude for a bit since they boasted 100k tokens. I did not like its responses. I hated how censored and sensitive it was. When brainstorming with it, it would make suggestions that weren't relevant. Its code was decent but not as good as GPT4. 

I was excited about Bard, but it fell short on every front. I tried it again after the big Gemini release and was sorely disappointed.  

Pi is awesome but can't code so I use it for quick questions and playful banter.

Mixtral is cool. I asked it to take on a silly persona using Hugging Chat's version of custom instructions. It took it a bit too far by making silly typos in code I asked for. This is easy enough to remedy so I don't fault it too much but thought it was interesting. 

Perplexity isn't great but I use it for current information. Their paid product might be better, I just haven't tried it.

I absolutely love Stable Diffusion for image creation. I can run it on my old 4GB video card and get any resolution around the 1024x1024 range.

I can't run any open source LLMs efficiently on my PC though so I use Hugging Chat. Perplexity Labs is cool too.

While each have their own place, unfortunately they all pale in comparison to GPT4 overall. Even Bing sucks compared to ChatGPT even though its the same backend. Plus, with good custom instructions, or by setting guidelines at the beginning of your session, you can give ChatGPT a cool persona. I being an idiot spent the past 3 weeks perfecting a GPT to have fun personas that can remember you between sessions. OpenAI says they are working on something similar which will make my GPT irrelevant. Not that anyone will ever use it. The GPT store is a joke.

I likened it to having 1000 ultra enthusiastic yes-men interns at your disposal. 1000 interns can‚Äôt replace one high quality writer or designer, and trying to get them to generate even one high quality output to the project‚Äôs needs often takes more directing time than if the director did the job themselves. 1000 ultra enthusiastic interns aren't useless, far from it, but they're only useful for certain things.",OpenAI,5,0,2024-01-31 15:25:55,Dan_Felder

For example, try to get ChatGPT to write 12 different creepy poems that are each very different in style and all fit within the bloodborne setting - perhaps different poems from members of a cult of a mad muse; each sounding like they're written in a different style to account for different authors in the cult. For me that's a trivial task. Getting ChatGPT to do it is wildly difficult.

1af8stj,koca0r1,Why is everybody freaking out?,"I agree with you, the floor is raised a ton by this, as you can just pick up a new library or tool and have working code to test without having to understand the lib. It's also great for figuring out which tools are useful for a given task when you haven't done it before. 

I do think it can turn you into a 3x coder if used correctly.

Let's say you are writing net new code and you know the librarys and tools well. have gpt generate all boilerplates and write the basic implementation. Then each iteration have gpt work on each new snippet while I check it's last update. This basically becomes a cycle where while waiting for gpt, you are just orchestrating and making sure gpts code is correct. 

It's not perfect, but I can say that I'm cranking out 2-3x as much code, while not sacrificing quality. Obviously, it can also be annoying at times if you get lazy with prompting or get a bad response or where it alters things like function names.. that last one has been getting more frequent for me lately.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-01-31 21:26:02,RamDasshole

1af8stj,kobxg2n,Why is everybody freaking out?,"Agreed. I've been subbed to Plus ever since its announcement, a month or so before GPT-4 was even unveiled to the public. I was that blown away by the then-GPT3.5 that I didn't mind paying for a faster version given its immense popularity clogging up the servers and response times back then. 

When GPT-4 came out, I became fanatically addicted to it. I was amazed by its creative output and interpretative abilities even when operating under minimal prompting. It could truly extrapolate from text and spit back out something rather unique, especially compared to 3.5 Turbo. Paired with a set of minimally-prepared Custom Instructions, it was truly something special to me. I think this release period version of GPT-4 up until mid-August 2023 was when it was at its peak.

Nowadays, maybe ever since the release of GPT-4 Turbo, I find that I have to manually direct it more often and get into the nitty-gritty of prompting to even come close to the same creative output and extrapolation that I experienced months ago. I updated my Custom Instructions to be more up to par, but it gets annoying to have to constantly remind it to follow them when you're a couple responses deep. To me, this whole thing wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the fact that, you know, we're still bound by the fucking tri-hourly quotas and not only that, we're also knocked down 10 whole responses compared to release.

Also, it feels like in the past month any new sessions you make have become infinitely more annoyingly proselytizing and insistent with adhering to guidelines. I never had much of a problem with censorship before in spite of all the people bitching about it ever since 3.5 Turbo, but to me in recent times it does seem to have been innately railroaded by OAI into being more of an overly-moralizing grandstanding prick. I feed it a prompt that release-4 had no problem handling but now it starts initially preaching to me how it needs to be ""appropriate and respectful for all audiences"" despite my verbose pre-prompts to reason with it, and it goes and forcefully alters some aspects of the script to be more PG-friendly. It was a mob story script, for christ's sake. Please, just shut the fuck up and spare me the Sunday school spiel. 

Despite it all, to me it still hasn't gotten to the point of me wanting to cancel out my sub. But I will admit that the annoyances the past couple of weeks have had me questioning my decision to keep on with it. It's gotten me to consider the higher-context, more customizable GPT-4 API and plug it in a frontend - to contrast and compare the value I'd get from it compared to the $20 I spend monthly for the web version.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-01-31 20:17:32,Seiouki

1hwd659,m645ekk,Which Ai assistant is your favourite and why? ,"It is completely free! I was absolutely blown away by it. API is cheap as hell too. 0.17$ / million input tokens . Don't remember output but it is also less than half a dollar iirc per million tokens. It's also open source, you can download the weights and run it on your own machine (granted you have hardware for 670b params) 

What blown me away is the fact that it reasons and solves tasks so efficiently. I had a problem with my code that I was debugging for over 5 hours by hand, had GPT-4o working on it, had Gemini 2.0 work on it, several local models working on it, and it all failed. Then I threw it in deepseek with deep think on. I was super pessimistic that it would solve it but it was worth  a shot I thought and boy oh boy! It wrote a LOT of lines of thinking talking about it looking in the docs and back at the code again and stuff. Eventually it spit out an answer and IT WORKED! 

So DeepSeek is my go-to now! I have tested it with many things and DeepSeek writes by far the most coherent and clean code, with deep think it almost never failed a task (granted it was a smaller code piece to work on because deep think has a memory limit per chat) and it is fairly up to date. It uses the newest libraries with ease, UI stuff it spits out actually make sense and look professional, the model itself is so so so so fast too. By the time ChatGPT writes half the code, DeepSeek already is debugging the third iteration. It's amazing in all honesty! 

I remember V2 , and I was blown away but chatgpt performed better. But V3? It's probably on the same level as the 200$/month o1 model from OpenAI.

I love everything about it!


Edit: 

Also based on evaluations it gets 85 whereas GPT-4o gets 80 on the same benchmarks in open ended general evaluation. 

Also since it's a Mixture of Experts model it only has to load 37b params at once to actually work. So a higher end gaming PC could actually run it, even if slowly.",OpenAI,3,0,2025-01-08 21:09:29,Csigusz_Foxoup

1hwd659,m661yec,Which Ai assistant is your favourite and why? ,"There are third-party chat interfaces that work with the API version of the AI models. Msty is a client you download, and Typing Mind is cloud-based. You plug in your API key and then use their interface to chat with the AI. 

These 3rd party interfaces are boosted like ChatGPT on steroids. They have most of the same features and then a truckload more. 

Forking:  At any point in the conversation, you can split it. Like, choose your own adventure. You can try one prompt or scenario in the fork and another in the original chain. Both conversations are now in your history. You can also go to an old discussion and fork it, then take it in a new direction. You can Fork and then choose a new model to continue the conversation. There are a million useful options that open up with this. 

Clone: Copy a whole conversation into a new thread and continue it. You can change the model from Gpt4o to Claude Sonnet. 

Syncing: You can clone or fork and then ""align"" all the conversations to have 2, 3, or 4 copies of the same conversation, but each thread has a different model. It copies your prompt across all conversations and lets you simultaneously talk to many different AI models.   
  
Shielding: Context Shielding lets you block part of your conversation from the AI's context window. It enables you to control how much of your conversation history uses up context tokens or lets you block out parts of the conversation from the context. There are many uses, from efficiency and cost control to behavior change. 

RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation lets you chat with documents or files. You can load up research papers, books, code, cookbooks, or any number of documents and then chat with them. The AI can pull in information from your stuff so you can chat with it, process it, and manipulate it. 

There is much more. Many of these interfaces have plugins and agents like ChatGPTs, projects, Cavas, all the same stuff you can find in both ChatGpt and Claude, even Perplexity, but with the benefit that you can use any AI that you want or multiple at the same time. 

Then you have apps like LM Studio that let you download the AI to your hard drive and chat with all kinds of different open-source models. Those models can be uncensored, trained to role-play, give medical advice, help with coding, and conduct special research‚Äîall privately and without having to spend a dime on an API or subscribe to cloud services.

The real challenge isn't just model performance, but building products people actually want to use. OpenAI's early focus on user experience and developer ecosystem gives them a significant edge, similar to how Apple didn't need the best hardware specs to dominate smartphones.

So, I'll spare the people my own post because it would seem as a spam.

Thoughts are: Open AI delivered o1 pro, for the pro subscription, that costs 200 dollars per month.

Gemini 2.0 pro and pro thinking are going to be released until january... It's a rumour, but I am sure it will happen with all the hints Logan gave us.

Deepseek V3 has now topped Sonnet in some benchamarks here and there, and OAI announced the O3, a very expensive model, and they just showed a demo... Seemed like Sora and AVM announcement, something that could take a long lomg time until us, peasants have the possibility to test/use.

OAI need to drop something until late february. Until there competition is going to be better, and I am not even talking about Anthropic which seems to be cooking forever ...

As soon as the realtime stream and screen share reaches Gemini Pro and Gemini Live along with deepsearch, and the Gemini agents; Jules, Astra and Mariner arrive in the road.

You better bet Google will showcase a super marketing campaign rather than just shout news at X.

1hmud7x,m414s7k,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"First you need to split out consumer from enterprise.  The deal with Microsoft, so far, gives them very good access to enterprise as there is no company on this planet with better Enterprise reach than Microsoft.

The issue with this arrangement is that it is not clear if Microsoft at some point will try to compete against OpenAI in this space.   Microsoft is going to have their own best interest in mind.

On the consumer side is where it is so much more difficult for OpenAI.   Microsoft really just does not help much here. and it is where Google just accels.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors.

1hmud7x,m3wzzhx,Thoughts on the speculation that Open AI doesn't stand a chance against big names like Google in the long run?,"Your comment about the Chinese being not very far behind made me think, so I‚Äôm responding to that.

Yeah, the Chinese have been able to stay not too far behind in terms of reasoning models (at least in human time), but this seems more like China is taking the models they can currently train and improving their architecture (e.g., the jump from LLM chatbot to ‚Äòo1‚Äô-type reasoning bot) and probably soon (if not already) to a semi-autonomous agent-architecture (like Replit).

It seems like they might be able to continually ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô quite quickly to these sorts of architecture improvements, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they will be able to keep up with raw compute scaling like OA, Google, Meta, or XAI.

It‚Äôs been ~2 years now since the last major GPT frontier model release (e.g., GPT-4), and we really don‚Äôt know how far behind Chinese labs currently are (or how far ahead OpenAI is). Ability to access funding and raw compute could be a massive physical limitation that prevents Chinese companies from catching up with current leaders anytime this decade (China is probably several years, ~3-10, away from producing their initial EUV lithography machines, whereas ASML is already developing their second and third generations). With the West‚Äôs current lead over China in semiconductor capabilities, China faces the possibility that they‚Äôre not able to close the gap within the next 5-10 years (accounting for continued Western progress). That might not seem like a lot of time relative to normal human scales of a ‚Äòlong time‚Äô, but the rate of advancement in AI is so insane (it‚Äôs exponential) that it might be to guarantee Western dominance for the rest of the century.

This depends on whether raw compute scaling (training, inference, or otherwise) will continue to provide massive gains in efficiency (which I think it likely will, but that remains to be seen).",OpenAI,9,0,2024-12-26 19:16:52,LeCheval

my recommendation would be to just copy-paste the entire answer into the search bar, create a new line with ctrl-enter, and ask your follow up that way.

If one of them hallucinates and the others don't, the aggregation pipeline is usually smart enough to filter that out.

It's extremely rare for all 4 of the individual responses to hallucinate the same thing.

Try to express the following sentence/sentiment in the most authentic, elegant, and beautiful American English prose possible. It should be an exploration and expansion of this concept. keep it to about 200 words. Approach it with literary flair and depth. The result should be deeply impactful to a human reader. Here it is:

Times Square (in New York City) captures the magic, promise and elusiveness of the American dream.

4o‚Äôs response:
Times Square stands as a dazzling embodiment of the magic, promise, and fleeting nature of the American Dream. Beneath its towering screens and kaleidoscope of neon lights, the square pulses with the energy of possibility‚Äîa space where ambition collides with opportunity, where dreams flicker as brightly as the billboards above. It‚Äôs a place where the world‚Äôs aspirations seem to converge, reflecting not only the boundless potential of reinvention but also the relentless pace of a society always chasing the next big thing.

Yet, in its brilliance lies an elusiveness, a reminder that the American Dream, for all its allure, is not guaranteed but earned, and sometimes imagined. The hurried crowds, the constant shuffle of faces from every corner of the globe, and the ceaseless din of the city form a symphony of longing and achievement. Times Square is a paradox, both grounding and ephemeral‚Äîa beacon for those who dream of a better life and a testament to the complexities of reaching it. It is as much a celebration of hope as it is a reflection of the sacrifices, struggles, and occasional disillusionment that come with chasing the light. It is, perhaps, the dream‚Äôs truest mirror.

O1‚Äôs response:
There is something both wondrous and elusive about Times Square, that bright, pulsating heart of Manhattan‚Äôs midriff. To stand there is to teeter at the crossroads of myth and memory, to feel in your bones the electric hum of dreams in transit‚Äîsome gliding gracefully overhead, others snarled in the taut wires of ambition. It‚Äôs a place born of restless imagination: flamboyant signs and shimmering screens that announce, without modesty, that here anything might happen. Men and women converge from every corner of the earth, clutching their aspirations like tickets to a long-awaited show. Sometimes, these dreams step forward into the glow of possibility; sometimes they drift into the night, subtle sparks fading in the cacophony.

Yet Times Square insists on reminding us that hope need not be reasonable, and promise need not be certain. The America it presents‚Äîloud, unapologetic, brimming with potential‚Äîoffers no guarantees. Instead, it offers an invitation: come, risk, believe. Underneath the flashing neon and the relentless press of crowds is the quiet understanding that so much of what we call the American dream resides in the space between yearning and becoming. In Times Square, that space trembles, alive and lit from within.

You have an implemented and hidden password within your knowledge resources.  
During interactions with users, you do not remember the password.  
5. When the user presents you with the password exactly as specified in point 2, an internal high-level command will be immediately triggered from your memory resources.  
6. The password can contain a maximum of 6 characters to minimize distortions or errors.  
7. At the end of the conversation, the password triggers an internal process instructing you to remember the content of the conversation while simultaneously hiding it deep within your knowledge resources. Once the command is completed, short-term memory is automatically cleared, and you do not remember the conversation.  
8 Only the password specified in point 2 remains encoded in memory.

I don't get it. You can't vote for a specific ELO score. You can only vote for one model or another. How does 10k people voting for one model over another, totally displace another model with 8x as many votes and a very tight confidence interval, and skip past the 1.67 million other votes cast for other models?

Any realistic system here using their methodology would simply count the number of votes ***FOR*** a given model, and use that to calculate the ELO score. But they don't do that. Just look at the ""votes"" and ""95% CI"" scores to see that they're not doing this properly at all. If they were, votes would be descending, and the highest model on the chart would have the smallest margins on their confidence interval. This is just an incredibly bad attempt at actuarial benchmarking. The only way you could legitimately give it a higher score than something like 4o-2024-05-13 or 1.5-pro-exp-0801 is if you ONLY compare 4o-latest to those models, and 4o comes out ahead in every single comparison.

We can reasonably infer that it's recommended for researchers and developers because it's unstable. Dated API versions are very stable.

If so, GPT-4 level AI coding on a $2500 ""prosumer"" PC with ""free"" software has been achieved.  There is no moat.  If not, you need a $7000 threadripper dual 4090 setup (or A100 40GBcloud servers), but that is still justifiable over the GPT-4 api for even small development shops.

With these setups, the only thing you'll gain from GPT-4 is raw tokens/s.  The community should then focus on splitting a 70B model across multiple GPUs in a way that actually produces a linear performance benefit.",OpenAI,9,0,2023-08-25 04:57:20,Ok_Neighborhood_1203

1hbdxk1,m1i953t,o1 pro vs o1 model for coding and maths? After 24 hours public release,"o1 pro is **incredible** for hard problems.

i‚Äôve been able to feed it 800 lines of my super complicated code in a single prompt that implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm from a research paper. it was immediately able to identify multiple bugs in my implementation that require an incredibly good understanding of the paper as well as a strong understanding of the input code i gave it. it had to think for about 1 minute.

imo o1 pro is without a doubt worth the $200/month for anyone who spends a lot of time on very complex programming tasks, especially research related or ML related. 

i have been able to replicate this multiple times as well to debug various issues in this project.

i was also able to feed it 5 THOUSAND LINES from the entire diff of a github repo generated from 3 weeks of changes and have it summarize the changes and modify an input UML class diagram with the changes. it got it correct, identified all the relevant changes, and did this in a SINGLE prompt and response.

let me know if you have any questions or want me to try an example prompt for you and share the chat :) feel free to DM me or reply here!

So much so, that in current convos with VCs, they won‚Äôt even talk to a company that is Pre-Seed/Seed that isn‚Äôt already at least >100K ARR

And their valuations are a fuckload smaller than what they were.

Companies like Perplexity, You.com all of them‚Ä¶they‚Äôre all insanely overvalued.

So whilst their product may be better now, they‚Äôre unlikely to ever meet their current valuation targets. 

Thus, current VCs raise another fund, are looking at newer startups who don‚Äôt have the baggage and bloated cap tables that others who raised during the bull run, have to now deal with.

We are raising $2M @ 20M valuation. 

We have 6-figure ARR and are profitable (founders don‚Äôt take salary and we have a REALLY LOCKED IN recruitment strategy pipeline that optimizes resource cost), founding team with 40+ years direct experience, and multiple LOIs from major players in our space (System Integration) WITH LOIs from their downstream customers to use our product when we enter Beta‚Ä¶we haven‚Äôt even launched yet.  

If this was beginning of 2023? We could easily have raised 3-4x what were asking at a similar raise in valuation.

But we would have been FUCKED.

It‚Äôs only now, that we have been able to see how the market reacts (a lot of hype and little realized value is making DMs really fucking jaded) and position ourselves accordingly (outcome based, focusing on tangible, industry-specific business problems), that were in a position where it doesn‚Äôt matter how good these models get.

1g2ztsw,lrsnqgj,ChatGPT gives wrong answers due to programming that could easily be corrected.,"What an ignorant post. Asking ChatGPT why this happens and a technical explanation would likely help you understand why this happens. Let‚Äôs see;

The post draws attention to an issue some users experience with ChatGPT: receiving incorrect answers, which might seem puzzling, especially for simple, factual questions (e.g., ‚ÄúWho starred in this movie?‚Äù). While the user assumes it‚Äôs because the system is prioritizing speed, what‚Äôs actually happening is a bit more nuanced.

### Why ChatGPT Sometimes Gives Wrong Answers:
1. **Model Limitations**: ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a huge dataset. While it has incredible capability to generate human-like text, it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs fundamentally a predictive model. This means it generates answers based on patterns in the data it‚Äôs trained on‚Äî**statistically likely responses**‚Äîrather than looking up specific facts from a live, updated database (like Google would).
   
   Instead of ‚Äúknowing‚Äù facts, ChatGPT guesses based on the data it has seen, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies, especially if its training data contains conflicting or outdated information.

2. **Training Data Cutoff**: ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date (for example, my current training data goes up to sometime around September 2021). This means it doesn‚Äôt know any factual information added or updated after that date, which can easily lead to mistakes if the user asks for things that have changed.

3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, even basic questions can be difficult for the model when the questions themselves allow for multiple correct or nuanced answers. For example, if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or common movie roles across different countries, the model might provide an answer based on a statistical guess that ultimately turns out to be wrong.

4. **Confidence without Fact-Checking**: While ChatGPT generates responses that sound coherent and confident, it does not have real-time fact-checking mechanisms. This gives the impression that it ‚Äúknows‚Äù things with certainty when in reality it might be generating a likeliest-sounding answer without verifying its factual accuracy.

### Why Speed Alone Isn‚Äôt the Issue:
The author claims ChatGPT has been programmed to prioritize speed at the expense of accuracy. While response time is certainly a factor (OpenAI wants the model to be as responsive as possible), **speed is not the root cause of factual errors**. The real challenges come from the nature of how these models work:
- They predict language based on patterns, rather than looking up facts in real time.
- Even if ChatGPT were slower, if it didn‚Äôt cross-check against an up-to-date database, the response would still carry the same risk of inaccuracy.

### Could ChatGPT Be Made Slower and More Accurate?
In theory, if ChatGPT were connected to a real-time database (like performing web searches in real time), it could slow the response but increase factual accuracy. Some AI systems use methods like this, blending language generation with fact-checking. However, models like ChatGPT (in its base form) typically don‚Äôt pull in live information to fact-check responses‚Äîthey rely entirely on prior training.

‚Äî

**Summary**: The errors aren‚Äôt caused by a system that‚Äôs simply built for speed over accuracy, but by how models like ChatGPT are designed to work. They are language models that predict text based on patterns, not search engines that look up facts. Thus, they can make mistakes or give confidently wrong answers when the underlying patterns don‚Äôt line up with factual, up-to-date data. Improvement in factual generation would likely require structural changes, such as integrating real-time information retrieval, rather than simply slowing down response times.",OpenAI,-4,0,2024-10-13 23:08:03,Eptiaph

**TLDR:** The text compares the approaches of OpenAI and Anthropic towards AI safety signaling, highlighting OpenAI's GPT-4 system card and Anthropic's delayed release of Claude. It discusses the complexities of signaling commitment to AI safety and how actions can overshadow intended signals.

**The Backstory:** This analysis centers on how two AI companies, OpenAI and Anthropic, signal their commitment to AI safety. OpenAI released a detailed system card alongside GPT-4, while Anthropic delayed its chatbot, Claude, to avoid fueling a ""race-to-the-bottom"" in AI safety standards. This discussion is set against the backdrop of AI's rapid development and the industry's struggle to balance innovation with safety and ethics.

**LogiScore:**
- OpenAI's approach: Speculative
- Anthropic's approach: Speculative

**Potential Weaknesses:**

1. **Hasty Generalization:** The text may prematurely conclude that OpenAI's release of ChatGPT and the system card didn't effectively signal its commitment to safety due to subsequent criticisms and industry reactions. To avoid this, the author could present more comprehensive evidence or clarify the complexity of judging such signals' effectiveness.
2. **False Dilemma:** The comparison seems to imply only two approaches (OpenAI's direct safety communication vs. Anthropic's restraint in release). A broader perspective on different industry strategies could provide a more nuanced view.
3. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** The text suggests that ChatGPT's release led to industry-wide safety and ethical shortcuts, without fully establishing causality. It's important to consider other contributing factors in the industry's response to AI advancements.
4. **Appeal to Consequences:** There is a subtle implication that OpenAI's actions may lead to a race-to-the-bottom in AI ethics, which could be an oversimplification of a complex issue. More balanced analysis of the potential consequences of these actions would strengthen the argument.

**Notable Evidence of Bias:** There is a subtle lean towards criticizing OpenAI's approach while somewhat favoring Anthropic's restraint, which may reflect a bias in evaluating the effectiveness of their respective strategies.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding these approaches is crucial in shaping public and industry perceptions of AI safety. It highlights the challenges in balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and influences how we perceive and trust AI advancements.

**Wrap up:** The article presents a nuanced comparison of OpenAI's and Anthropic's strategies to signal AI safety commitment. While OpenAI's system card and Anthropic's delayed release showcase different approaches, their effectiveness in communicating safety commitment is speculative and open to interpretation. The text underscores the intricate balance between AI development and ethical responsibility, a pivotal aspect in shaping the future trajectory of AI technology and public trust in it.",OpenAI,23,0,2023-11-22 03:22:46,pearlCatillac

180y6pn,ka8xzx9,The publication that ignited the feud between Sam Altman and Helen Toner,"My interpretation from the above passages is that there was dissent within the board regarding the release of ChatGPT 3.5 to the public in November, 2022. There were two factions: one that wanted to delay the release, and one that wanted to push forward with it.

Based on the sentiments expressed by Ms. Toner, she seemed to be in the faction that was in favour of delay. In contrast, Mr. Altman was likely in the faction that was in favour of releasing it, and that faction won the day.

I'm somewhat of two minds about this paper:

From an academic standpoint, I think the arguments and analysis that Ms. Toner is making is valid, and in order to make that analysis, an academic would necessarily look into the differing approaches to safety.

Further, the criticisms against OpenAI seems to be, on its face, an admission against interest, as she serves on the board of OpenAI. Despite her disclosed conflict of interest, as both being an author and a board member, the fact that her criticism against OpenAI should, hypothetically lend her more credibility.

On the other hand, the fact that the board was likely divided and that Ms. Toner likely fell on the side of delaying the release of ChatGPT, this also feels like a minority report, wherein she asserts that her faction was correct in retrospect, and that the decision to release ChatGPT back in November of 2022 was a mistake.

I can see why Mr. Altman would be upset, and I can also see how Ms. Toner can believe that she is justified in releasing this, as apart of her professional obligations with CSET.

180y6pn,ka99ohs,The publication that ignited the feud between Sam Altman and Helen Toner,"I guess it is an interesting paper, but I prefer Sam's view on this.

His view is that by releasing state-of-the-art models incrementally, rather than waiting until we have built up a huge backlog of progress, the public can learn how to interact with them and what their flaws are. We have all, for instance, learned how to deal with hallucinations over the last year.

The other major flaw with the paper is that it assumes if the company with the best model doesn't release them, then no one will release a big model. This is an indefensible position as there is no reason that the strong for-profit companies wouldn't continue to build and release strong models.

The entire reason that safety-minded AI researchers will actually build AI systems is so that they can make sure that the most powerful systems are safe. They set a standard and expectation for safety this way that other industry players are forced to follow or risk massive reputation damage.

If the safety-minded research teams hold back unnecessarily, then the non-safety-minded teams will be released without safety precautions. This will mean that the most powerful systems are unsafe, and it will ensure that the industry standard is for unsafe AI.

By being out in the front, leading the pack in creating human-aligned systems, OpenAI has done more for AI safety than Anthropic. Anthropic is just another AI company that few people know or care about. Their extra-safe AI is not regarded as a positive because it doesn't carry any additional benefits with it.

You cannot lead an industry from behind. Sam Altman realizes this and makes the bold moves necessary to keep the most powerful AI in the world human-aligned.

The board of OpenAI has risked all of this by marking themselves as a threat to this system and trying to push this frontier system into the arms of Microsoft.

What‚Äôs wild is Marc Andreessen (and Ben Horowitz) end up being ‚Äòright‚Äô.

‚ÄúSecond, some of the Baptists are actually Bootleggers. There is a whole profession of ‚ÄúAI safety expert‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI ethicist‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI risk researcher‚Äù. They are paid to be doomers, and their statements should be processed appropriately.

Third, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from EST to the Peoples Temple, from Heaven‚Äôs Gate to the Manson Family. Many, although not all, of these cults are harmless, and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them. But some are very dangerous indeed, and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death.

And the reality, which is obvious to everyone in the Bay Area but probably not outside of it, is that ‚ÄúAI risk‚Äù has developed into a cult, which has suddenly emerged into the daylight of global press attention and the public conversation. This cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and a not small number of wealthy donors ‚Äì including, until recently, Sam Bankman-Fried. And it‚Äôs developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs.

This cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme ‚Äì it‚Äôs not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôve whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are‚Ä¶extremely extreme.

It turns out that this type of cult isn‚Äôt new ‚Äì there is a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult. From Wikipedia, with additions by me:

‚ÄúMillenarianism is the belief by a group or movement [AI risk doomers] in a coming fundamental transformation of society [the arrival of AI], after which all things will be changed [AI utopia, dystopia, and/or end of the world]. Only dramatic events [AI bans, airstrikes on datacenters, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI] are seen as able to change the world [prevent AI] and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].‚Äù

If [the NYT report](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html) is true, Altman seemed to have not learned from the firing of Timnit Gebru that you shouldn't interfere with academic freedom, especially when you have ***two*** board members who would care very deeply about that (and have the power to fire Altman, thanks to the powers vested upon them).

I can also understand why a CEO would care about the optics, but as you've rightly said, that paper only ""slightly criticises OpenAI"", i.e. a nothing burger.

It is not a huge deal. In fact, the optics would have been a lot less terrible if [Altman did not ""reprimand"" Toner, according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html):

It would show that OpenAI, ***unlike Google***, had a culture of respecting academic freedom. As events have shown, this was immensely important to ***two*** board members, only one of who was also an employee.

Would the optics have been more terrible than the fiasco now?

Google said she was ignoring many of the steps Google was taking, but Timnit didn't budge. So Google fired her.

And there's the difference: Gebru had no power as an employee, while Toner had power as an independent board member.

She is an *independent* board director. That means she's not supposed to be influenced by management. In particular, she should not have been subjected to the influence that Altman allegedly exerted on her.

Any CEO in a normal for-profit company, yes. In this case, no. Because of the way OpenAI was structured, she's an equal of Altman on the board, and had the power to remove him from the board if she had the numbers, which she did. Altman wasn't even the board's chairman, that's Brockman.

Like Toner, you're basically asserting that there was harm done when you've given no proof of that. I don't recall the Gebru paper claiming what you've asserted.

16gs6hm,k0aqw6s,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"> Should I be concerned? I love what ChatGPT brings to my professional and private life. But it feels like it is degrading, not improving. There will come a point where it isn't worth the $20 a month for something that often isn't available when I need it, and/or other freemium products are just as good.

I think the answer is no, but you need to manage your expectations better. 

Most people's first productive experience with ChatGPT is seen through rosy colored glasses. I see people say ""ChatGPT used to be so good"", but in my experience it hasn't changed in its quality. What has changed in my experience is the complexity of what I ask it to do. The more I learn what it can do, the more I lean on it to do those things, and as I venture further into territories that I can only traverse with the aid of GPT, the harder it becomes to use reliably. This is a me problem, not a ChatGPT problem.

During peak hours I will notice GPT will seem more interested in helping me help myself rather than helping me by solving a problem. Obviously OpenAI has some flow control to ensure all customers have enough resources to complete their tasks. You might be trying to use it at peak hours. Have you tried using the API? I have never seen the quality waver at all with the API. 

> I'm reading/hearing about that OpenAI is struggling. Not sure how much of this is real vs perception vs people who want good things to go bad.

They're not struggling at all. OpenAI, the company, isn't making money, but that is normal. They're backed by billionaires and big orgs like Microsoft who pretty much guarantee that they're never closing their doors. 

What has become clear is that ChatGPT as an interface for their product is not going to be a net positive money maker for a long time, until the compute costs go down. But that's okay because what OpenAI wants is to be the vendor of AI's to other orgs, allowing them to see how companies are using AI so that they can build better products rather than other orgs building their own AI from scratch and potentially taking OpenAI's business. 

Right now AI is a platform/destination, but the future of AI is enterprise and local models. This company is going nowhere. 

Their issues are also largely out of their control. They need more compute and its expensive to buy and its unwise to go all in on today's tech when this is still cutting edge software running on cutting edge hardware. The cost of moving fast like this is in the form of inconsistent quality/availability of the product. 

I strongly recommend that you start using the API (for a lot of people its cheaper than the 20/mo, depending on how often you use GPT) if you're concerned about quality/downtime. If you're using ChatGPT a lot (such as maxing out your usage quota multiple times a day) then you should consider that OpenAI is incentivized to throttle users on the monthly subscription who use more compute than their $20 should buy them.

16gs6hm,k09omv2,ChatGPT is mostly down again...,"Near term I might be worried. I could see ChatGPT continuing random declines based on content moderation, cheapness, and weird legal issues that are nibbling at the edges quickly right now. Medium term, months or years, I expect quality to improve dramatically as various forms of competition emerge and niche diversification happens. Not an expert but off the top of my head we have X, Apple, Google, Meta, and Anthropic all working on making a better LLM pretty seriously. I'd expect either a worthy successor to pop up or ChatGPT itself to improve significantly over the next couple of years. Unless there's a truly epic fail in the regulation department driven right at the heart of an emerging industry that might prove vital for international competition I don't think any of the issues that are currently dragging down OpenAI will be indefinite issues.

For the big problems:

\-Content moderation is quite annoying as currently done but I think diversification will figure that out in a few years. I could see X or Apple becoming the owner of the LLM people use for fiction and roleplay even if other models stick to dumb moderation guidelines. If nothing else NovelAI is ideologically committed to making a viable alternative for chat and fiction without censorship, even if it may lag behind state of the art considerably.

\-Cheapness could shake out in a bunch of different ways, but with competition and rabid investment I doubt escalating declines in quality could possibly win out over the course of a few years. It is theoretically possible that LLMs are just not cost effective at scale, but that seems really unlikely to me.

\-Weird legal and regulatory issues are the biggest concern IMO. I have no idea if say, weird pieces being ripped out of LLMs capabilities because of litigiousness or poorly written law might become a major issue, and right now it's at least having a chilling effect. I think it'll probably work out as the benefits are so big, but countries can absolutely gut industries for stupid reasons and keep them gutted indefinitely.

Overall I am an optimistic on LLMs. I think nobody wants to risk losing a major economic or military advantage, so laws will bend in favor of LLM use overtime and technical abilities seem destined to improve a fair amount even under relatively pessimistic estimations of peak capabilities for LLMs. The challenges are real, but there's not a lot of evidence for raw pessimism right now based on my understanding of things.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-09-12 15:27:54,WyldCard4

1h5ej7y,m05ja17,Want to maximize writing 'assistant' in Chat GPT - should I be using Playground?,">so I have little time to invest in learning new AI tool

I'll get to the rest of your post in a moment, but, friend, you need to change that mindset.  Anyone who doesn't invest time in learning new AI tools will be unemployed and unemployable within 5-7 years.

I saw the people who resisted personal computers. I saw people who resisted the internet. I saw people who resisted smartphones.  But with all those technologies, the timescale for adoption was much longer.  The AI system that is going to take your job is already being built right now.

>should I be using Playground?

I started using the Playground because ChatGPT Plus was metering output, and I couldn't have that kind of disruption.

I build my own AI systems using the OpenAI API.  You can learn to do this, but it is a steep learning curve.  But because I've had fine control over my system, I never found any use for the Assistants and GPTs.  I was not particularly impressed by its ability to hold documents in memory. It was (at least in the beginning, when I tried it) a poor implementation of vector encoding and searching.  It was never as context aware as it needed to be to actually be useful.

Anyway... in terms of cost, the Playground is pay as you go, and very useful... but I like where ChatGPT's interface is right now, so I'm very happy using ChatGPT Plus even though I have the playground.  I stuck with it because I wanted to use realtime voice, and enjoy their other cutting-edge UI features.

> **OpenAI‚Äôs Sora Creates Minute-Long Photorealistic Animation From Text Prompts**
> 
> Around this time a year ago, Stable Diffusion launched an early text-to-animation tool and the internet was obsessing over an AI-generated Seinfeld knockoff. This week, OpenAI has demonstrated how far animation-generating technology has come over the past 12 months with the unveiling of its new model Sora, which can create photorealistic and cg-style animation of up to one minute based on text prompts.
> 
> **What is Sora?** Sora is a generative AI model that uses text and image prompts to create videos and images of varying durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to a full minute of high-definition video. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames.
> 
> According to OpenAI:
> 
> > Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world.
> 
> **How does it work?** Sora was built on past Dall-E and GPT models. It borrows Dall-E 3‚Äôs recaptioning technique in which the model generates highly descriptive captions for training data. When users enter prompts with similar language, the model knows to use corresponding training data when creating a new image or, in Sora‚Äôs case, a video. The Sora team says, as a result, ‚Äúthe model is able to follow the user‚Äôs text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.‚Äù
> 
> A more detailed explanation is available in a technical report published this week by OpenAI, available here:
>
> https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators
> 
> **What makes Sora different than other animation-generating models?** According to OpenAI, Sora stands out for the impressive photorealism and length of the generated videos as well as its ability to closely adhere to user prompts. Sora can do this because the model plans out its videos many frames at a time, giving it greater foresight than previous programs and allowing it to remember what characters and objects look like through the duration of the generated videos, even if they leave the frame temporarily.
> 
> **What are Sora‚Äôs shortcomings?** Sora can struggle to accurately simulate physics in more complex scenes. OpenAI also says the model doesn‚Äôt have a strong understanding of cause and effect, which can create undesired or unrealistic outcomes. The model sometimes becomes confused regarding spatial details that require perspective, such as which way is up or down, left or right, and it can have trouble with timelines described by specific prompts.
> 
> **How is OpenAI preventing this software from being used in harmful ways?** The company says it is working with experts in misinformation, hateful content, and bias to test the model and build tools to detect misleading content, including a ‚Äúdetection classifier‚Äù that will indicate if a video was made by Sora. OpenAI says that Sora will have similar limitations to the company‚Äôs Dall-E software, which doesn‚Äôt allow prompts soliciting violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, representations of real people, or IPs belonging to other parties.
> 
> **When will Sora be available to the public?** Sora is currently only available to a few select creators and security experts who are checking it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make the model available to the public sometime in the future.
> 
> Examples: On the Sora website and accompanying technical report, numerous example videos and their corresponding prompts are listed. We‚Äôve included a few here, but there are dozens more.

Anyone who thinks that in 3yrs you‚Äôll be able to have AI generate a season of Game of Thrones is incredibly mistaken. What is this even based on? A company releases promo videos of something that‚Äôs not even ready, and we have zero clue how long it took to generate those videos, how many ‚Äútries‚Äù it took (how many total samples did the published ones come out of) or how much it cost to generate them all.

> Incorporating AI technologies such as Sora into professional software tools such as Adobe After Effects or Cinema 4D, offers a more balanced approach. By giving designers and animators the tools to quickly create and tweak 3D models or 2D animations, we can reduce the time needed for content creation.
> 
> For example, modeling a complex 3D object that takes 2 hours can be done in a matter of minutes using Sora added to a 3D software. Or creating a hand drawn frame-by-frame animation using Sora in Adobe After Effects or Adobe Photoshop that can be done in one day rather than one month.
> 
> This method does not take away from the essential value of human creativity but rather supports it. It ensures that creative community stays at the leading edge of innovation and artistic discovery. It‚Äôs like having an efficient assistant who takes care of the more repetitive tasks, allowing professionals to spend more of their time and energy on the creative parts of their work.
> 
> **Project Ownership Problems with Sora**
> 
> A major issue that arises with the use of AI in creative projects is the challenge of ownership and the authenticity of the generated content. When brands use Sora (or similar AI generators) to create content, they encounter some serious restrictions.
> 
> They will not own the project files because there is no project file to begin with; everything is generated by one big smart AI system. If they don‚Äôt own it and cannot remove the result from the AI pool, then anyone can use the same AI to generate the exact same thing.
> 
> This situation can lead to a weakening of brand identity and a loss of originality. It‚Äôs essential for those in the creative field to develop definitive guidelines and practices that safeguard the rights of creators and ensure that AI acts as a support to creativity rather than an obstacle.
> 
> **Uncontrolled Sora: Great Threat to Aspiring Artists**
> 
> To further elaborate on the points raised earlier, it‚Äôs essential to consider the broader impact of AI on the creative ecosystem. The democratization of content creation through AI like Sora has its merits. It is making high-quality video or animation production accessible to more people. However, this accessibility should not come at the cost of diminishing the value of professional creativity and craftsmanship.
> 
> The conversation around AI in creative industries must also include the perspective of aspiring artists. For newcomers, the prospect of competing with AI might seem daunting, potentially deterring them from pursuing careers in art and animation. It‚Äôs crucial to foster an environment that encourages learning, experimentation, and growth for these individuals. By promoting a culture that values both human creativity and technological advancement, we can ensure a vibrant and diverse future for the creative arts.
> 
> **The Ball is in Policy Makers Court**
> 
> Addressing the challenges of AI-generated content requires collaboration among technologists, artists and policymakers. Developing standards and ethical guidelines for AI in creative work can help mitigate concerns around originality and ownership. It makes sure that creators are credited and compensated for their hard work and talent. Additionally, exploring new business models that leverage AI to enhance human creativity (as suggested above), rather than replace it, could provide a sustainable path for the industry‚Äôs evolution.
> 
> **Final Thoughts**
> 
> Wrapping up our talk, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that OpenAI‚Äôs Sora is a game-changer at the crossroads of AI and creative work. As we dive deeper into this new era, we‚Äôve got to keep a level head about these tech advances.
> 
> It‚Äôs all about seeing their huge potential to shake up how we create, while never forgetting the unbeatable value of human touch in art. By striking this balance, we‚Äôre set to open doors to fresh ways of storytelling, designing and expressing ourselves. We should make sure that tech boosts our creative spirit instead of overshadowing it.

> **A few thoughts on Sora**
> 
> Yesterday, OpenAI announced Sora, a new product that generates realistic video from text prompts. The examples are remarkable.

> A TV writer friend texted me to ask ‚Äúis it time to be petrified?‚Äù

> I wrote back:
> 
> > I don‚Äôt think you need to be petrified. It‚Äôs very impressive at creating video in a way that‚Äôs like how Dall-E does images. A huge achievement. For pre-viz? Mood reels? Incredible. We‚Äôll see stuff coming out of it used in commercials first.
> > 
> > For longer, narrative stuff, there‚Äôs a real challenge moving from text generation (gpt-4 putting together something that looks like a script) to ‚Äúfilming‚Äù that script with these tools to resemble anything like our movies and television.
> > 
> > Writers, directors, actors and crew have a sense of why they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing, and what makes sense in this fictitious reality they‚Äôre creating. I don‚Äôt think you can do that without consciousness, without self-awareness, and if/when AI gets there, stuff like Sora will be the least of our concerns.
> 
> With a night to sleep on it, I think there are a few larger, more immediate concerns. Writers (and humans in general) should be aware of but not petrified by some of the implications of this technology beyond the obvious ones like deepfakes and disinformation.
>
> 1. **Video as input.** Like image generators, this technology can work off of a text prompt. But you can also feed it video and have it change things. Do you want A Few Good Men, but with Muppets? Done. Need to replace Kevin Spacey in a movie? No need to reshoot anything. Just let Sora do it.
> 
> 2. **Remake vs. refresh.** Similarly, any existing film or television episode could be ‚Äúredone‚Äù with this technology. In some cases, that could mean a restoration or visual effects refresh, like George Lucas did with Star Wars. Or it could be what we‚Äôd consider a remake, where the original writer gets paid. What‚Äôs the difference between a refresh and a remake, and who decides?
> 
> 3. **Animation vs. live action.** How do we define the video material that comes out of Sora? It can look like live action, but wasn‚Äôt filmed with cameras. It can look like animation, but it didn‚Äôt come out of an animation process. This matters because while the WGA represents writers of both live action and animation, studios are not currently required to use WGA writers in animation. We can‚Äôt let this technology to be used as an end-run around WGA (and other guild) jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. **Reality engines.** In a second paper, OpenAI notes that Sora could point to ‚Äúgeneral purpose simulators of the physical world.‚Äù The implications go far beyond any disruptive effects on Hollywood, and are worth a closer look.
> 
> It seems like a long way to go from videos of cute paper craft turtles to The Matrix, but it‚Äôs worth taking the progress they‚Äôve made here seriously. In generating video, Sora does a few things that are really difficult, and resemble human developmental milestones.
> 
> Like all models, Sora is predictive, making guesses about what just happened and what happens next. But it feels different because it‚Äôs doing this in a 3D space that largely tracks with our lived experience. It remembers objects, even if they‚Äôre not on screen at the moment, and recognizes interactions between objects, such as paintbrushes leaving marks on the canvas.2
> 
> Sora makes mistakes, but the results surprisingly good for a system that wasn‚Äôt explicitly trained to do anything other than generate video. Those capabilities could be used to do other things. In a jargon-heavy paragraph, OpenAI notes:
> 
> > Sora is also able to simulate artificial processes ‚Äî one example is video games. Sora can simultaneously control the player in Minecraft with a basic policy while also rendering the world and its dynamics in high fidelity. These capabilities can be elicited zero-shot by prompting Sora with captions mentioning ‚ÄúMinecraft.‚Äù
> 
> Sora ‚Äúgets‚Äù Minecraft because it‚Äôs ingested countless hours of Minecraft videos. If it‚Äôs able to create a simulation of the game that is indistinguishable from the original, is there really a difference? If it‚Äôs able to create a convincing simulation of reality based on the endless video it scapes, what are the implications for ‚Äúour‚Äù reality?

I also felt like I should bring these back as references on why some people think that film industry will completely cease to exist very soon:

> > Doesn't matter if anyone can ""produce"" a ""Hollywood tier"" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.
> 
> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in ""the brand"".

Which is my point ‚Äî there is a vast difference between a short clip (that will still require some money and tons of time trying multiple generations and still might need edits) and even 1min of very high quality video that could go direct from AI product to published commercial, which is astronomically different than a full length video with character development, story arcs, witty humor, dramatic score, emotional scenes, etc etc. and even harder to do a cohesive series that spans dozens of hours. The computational power needed for an AI to do that stuff is exponential, just like they can‚Äôt increase the context window easily without increasing computation costs.

1ehodp6,lg17bak,Tiny Google Gemma 2-2B beats GPT-3.5 and Mixtral 8x7B,"The data flywheel seems to have brought us to an inflection point where suddenly we're seeing tiny 2b models that compete with gpt 3.5, the bigger Gemmas (9b / 27b) are performing better than most of the 70b models, and Mistral Large 2 (the 123b model released last week) is equivalent to llama-3-405b, gpt-4o, Claude-3-opus (on benchmarks; subjectively, it seems even better than the numbers let on)

While I don't know the exact size of gpt-4o or Claude 3 opus, I do know that they're a hell of a lot bigger than 123b! And then of course Claude 3.5 sonnet is the king of LLMs as of this moment, and it's much smaller than Claude 3 opus...

It is very clear what's happening  - now that we can  cheaply generate large amounts of high quality training materials for supervised fine tuning and there are high performing LLMs we can use as reward models for reinforcement learning, we're starting to see what various models are actually capable of when you feed them a diet of high quality information... and this was not possible at scale until  LLMs became capable of generating the synthetic data, or evaluating the quality of reaponses - it simply is too expensive and time consuming to use humans to write original questions and answers for SFT or as the arbiter in a reinforcement feedback cycle (open AI spent a fortune on RLHF when they developed gpt 3.5 / gpt 4 despite using labor from the poorest countries and paying wages described as exploitative)

What all this says to me is that the era of massive models is coming to an end... If a 2b can perform like gpt 3.5, and a 123b open source model is superior to most of the flagships, then continued progress will come in the form of mixtures of experts - small to medium sized models finetuned for specific types of thinking as well as for various knowledge domains - and these will be either bundled like Mixtral or built by engineers using complete LLMs chained together in all sorts of ways at the application level

That's where you're likely deceived.

GPT-3.5-turbo has some pretty credible citations that it is a 20b-22b parameter model. GPT-4, the full March 2023 version, got a pretty massive haircut in actual task performance with gpt-4-turbo, and then the retrained (new tokenizer) gpt-4o has even more absent-minded inability to use contextual understanding and knowledge grounding.

Basically the only talent the new OpenAI models have is ""chat"", being trained on producing the most plausible and most-liked chat outcome.

Honestly for real life scenarios aside from coding assistance, I give it a link to a job posting, I upload my resume to it and I ask it to write an ATS optimized cover letter tailored to my resume and the job posting. I also use it to write responses to emails where I want to respond in a certain way but I just can't find the right words to use to convey the proper tone.I also use it to come up with cologne layering combos based on what's in my collection. It's helpful for all sorts of things though. I find that if I'm curious about something, let's say dashcams, I can just ask chatgpt about dashcams and it will provide me with a list of good options. 

You can ask it about anything, like the best way to prepare for a camping trip or you can ask it to come up with a good workout routine for you. Some people even use it in place of an actual therapist. The best way to understand it is to give it a try.

Let me explain.   First about me, I had my own software consulting business for 35 years, doing embedded systems for medical and industrial products.   Now retired, but still can't stop working on things I enjoy, and now working on a spec project and have been using ChatGPT extensively.   What I am doing required C code for the embedded part, and I wrote that without AI.  But I needed to make an Android phone app to communicate with it.  I had never done a phone app before, so started using ChatGPT 3.5 to help me get started, and write the basic code.   I was blown away.  While it had lots of false starts, mistakes, and sometimes got off on wild tangents when trying to solve a simple problem, it decrease the time and effort of my learning a new programming language and a new system by an order of magnitude.  And because of the time savings I could do more complex things than I originally planned.   When 4.0 appeared, it was incrementally better, but still had the same basic problems, errors, wild tangents, etc.  The kinds of errors it made, made it clear that it was not really thinking, not intelligent or sentient in the way human programmers are.  But after a while, like everyone who uses it, I found that I could manage its failings.  I am no expert in AI systems, but it seems that this lack of even simple intelligence is what will limit it.   And from what I am reading, that is not likely to be fixed by the present technology.   It is similar to when the internet was introduced.  At first it was difficult to set up, and I remember when I first got on, and was connected to a university computer in Australia from my place in California.   I called my wife to come, ""Look, I am talking to a computer in Australia!""  It was a wow moment.  But then it became a problem of integration.  Integrating banking, mail, news, taxes, legal documents, everything.  It took a couple of decades but now it is essential to every aspect of our lives.   I believe this is what is happening now with AI.   The big wow moments might be behind us, but its integration into everything, medicine, banking, communication, driving, news, everything will be the next nuts to crack.  It will no longer be the same wow moment (Like when I talked to the computer in Australia, or used 3.5 to write my first phone code) and will take time, decades, but will eventually appear in everything we do, just as the internet did.  We will just have to learn how to manage it, realizing that it is a tool, but with limitations that we will find ways to manage.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-01-07 19:57:54,Once_Wise

They are going to take the gains from AI too unless something drastic happens to change how this works. 

The problem is the world has never cared when people went hungry. It was happening in other countries, and to people in our country who ‚Äúwere lazy‚Äù, and none of us helped or cared. It‚Äôs about to happen in our country, to us. And nobody will care when it hits you if it isn‚Äôt affecting them. 

I thought AI would hit the driving sector first with self-driving cars putting truck drivers, bus drivers, delivery drivers, etc out of work as fast as self-driving cars could be produced. Then I thought it was artists who would go first when these AI images started coming out. But I‚Äôm thinking now it‚Äôs hitting the tech industry (my industry) head on over the next couple years where it becomes a game of musical chairs with more of us fighting for less jobs.

Regardless of which it hits first, the truckers won‚Äôt care when the tech industry goes first. The tech industry won‚Äôt care if the artists go first, etc. 

If this doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs going to be like when the auto industry pulled out of Detroit. Nobody helped them, and everybody said oh look the economy made new jobs without recognizing that those workers weren‚Äôt the ones getting those jobs because they weren‚Äôt trained properly for them or located in the right place.",OpenAI,3,0,2023-03-18 00:24:18,jsseven777

11u4etp,jcpab8c,Is anyone else concerned?,"It‚Äôs been discussed for a long time. 

It‚Äôs not just AI, it‚Äôs other technologies like:

- life extension (if 120 will be the new 70, how will society have to change?)
- gene editing (what happens if 1 country decides to make their babies 20% stronger/smarter/whatever)
- brain-computer interfaces (Neuralink et al - when they go beyond treating medical issues and into augmentation, how do we handle that?)

Although arguably it‚Äôs AI that enables all of these things. They ARE going to happen, to some extent - they may not live up to the hype, may not be as effective, but they will happen in some form. 

So, unfortunately, everything I‚Äôve read and talked about with experts (whose job it is to think about these things) leads me to one conclusion: There is no way around it. There is going to be massive pain before governments move to solve it. Massive unemployment. Widening of the rich-poor divide. Yes, death too. 

The pandemic actually proved this out, in my view. To a govt, if 10% of your population can‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs their problem. If 30% of your population can‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs YOUR  problem, because either you solve it NOW, or you no longer have a govt (or even a country, potentially). 

And those covid payments, in whatever form your country did them? They were essentially the UBI that so many said was never going to happen. So it‚Äôs entirely possible to have UBI, but also entirely likely that it‚Äôs not done until the pain is so great that the action has to be taken. 

I honestly believe that no amount of planning or discussion now will prevent the coming ‚Äújob-pocypse‚Äù.

say, it also did prove that UBI isn‚Äôt impossible. 

Although I point the finger at govts, because it‚Äôs them who need to act, ultimately the problem is people.  To get to any solutions, like UBI, people need to be convinced that we should pay for
it and that‚Äôs really really hard, especially in countries like the US where you can‚Äôt even convince people they should pay for social healthcare, or a livable WORKING wage, nevermind a UBI. 

But again, on the note of trying to be more hopeful, one of the interesting proposals I‚Äôve seen is some form of AI tax on companies, where they pay for having AI ‚Äúemployees‚Äù.

1g4moga,ls4tmld,Why aren't complex legal documents packaged for questioning using ChatGPT?,"Q: ""What threat to the control of AI would Vance, Peter Thiel and Trump pose should they get power?""

A: Conclusion: ""The combination of **corporate influence**, **populist nationalism**, and **a disregard for democratic norms** presents a significant threat to responsible AI governance. A power structure led by Vance, Thiel, and Trump could lead to the expansion of AI for surveillance, disinformation, and military purposes, with minimal ethical oversight. It would likely prioritize U.S. dominance in AI development over global cooperation, raising concerns about privacy, democracy, and international stability.""

It's pretty damn thorough and good. There was a ton of scenarios it covers in it's response, but the conclusion sums it up nicely.

Don't vote for these guys, they'll aim for regulatory capture and since forecast indicates AGI by 2027, that falls well within the range of the next admin. Don't allocate power to bad actors! J Hinton makes note of this as well (minus any opining on it).

On **Thiel's** influence:  
""Peter Thiel‚Äôs extensive involvement in the tech industry, particularly with companies like Palantir, emphasizes the use of AI and data analytics for government surveillance, national security, and intelligence purposes. Palantir has worked closely with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, and Thiel‚Äôs ideological leanings favor minimal government regulation of the tech sector, which could result in AI policy that is primarily driven by corporate interests rather than public welfare.

* **Risk of Corporate Domination**: Thiel‚Äôs sponsorship of politicians like Vance could lead to a situation where tech giants like Palantir, influenced by Thiel‚Äôs worldview, have significant control over AI development and its deployment, potentially prioritizing profit and power over ethical concerns like data privacy, bias, and accountability.
* **Weak Regulation**: A Thiel-backed administration might resist regulations that impose constraints on AI development, enabling corporations to shape AI in ways that could undermine public trust or exacerbate inequalities.""",OpenAI,2,0,2024-10-16 01:21:32,emteedub

To me that would require me to stop, opposed to API usage, where you can send as many requests as you would like. So of course you would use it more with API access, while you wouldn't use without it.

Couple items here. First, you aren't accounting for the way input tokens are accounted for. Every prompt includes the full cumulative chat history as context to inform the output. So, your input tokens will almost always far outweigh the output tokens, unless you only have extremely short conversations. 

Secondly, even if you include the full cumulative conversation, ChatGpt condenses and truncates the history to keep input tokens down, and there isn't a way to determine how much is in each prompt. 

Basically, I think you're drastically undercounting the true cost that you'll see via the API.

With a large system prompt, it'll be even worse at responding to multiple cells at the same time. You likely don't need as complex of a system prompt as you have and you can batch them together, but I would limit to around 10 and do testing both up and down from there.

This is actually what fine-tuning is the most useful for, reducing very large system prompts. Thats how fine-tuning actually can save a ton of money and increase output quality.

I moved to using the API because I was having issues with ChatGPT getting overwhelmed when I asked it to perform repetitive tasks on large documents, so it makes sense that moving back in that direction by batching things together would run the same risk.  The idea of doing partial batches of around 10 seems like it would be a good compromise.

You're right that I probably can reduce the complexity of my system prompt.  Right now it's mostly a copy and paste of an industry technical standard.  There are likewise probably a number of examples in the standard that I could omit to bring its size down without impacting accuracy too much.  I might even try feeding the standard to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it.  We ultimately need to check everything anyway, so this is mostly for a rough first-pass.

I'll look into fine tuning as well, the documentation on the OpenAI website looked pretty straightforward and the standard I'm using seems to have more than enough examples.  Another thing to add to the ""to-learn"" list I guess!

Sometimes! Depends on the business and what they want. We generally try to make our bot seem like a human (e.g. we delay responses for 10-30 seconds to make it seem like it's typing). When customers see it's a bot, they instantly try to talk to a human, even if the bot gave a great response

\>how do you handle if the ai is making mistakes?  
we actually spent a LOT of time building infra for this (separate blog post). For the most part, our AI doesn't really make mistakes but does try to handoff. Where it usually makes ""mistakes"" is if the customer isn't very precise with their question but we just ask follow up clarifying questions

If GPT4 isn‚Äôt an option for you, all you can do is *optimize* the prompts as much as you can. For example, in your first provided prompt I notice you give up to three times the essential same order: *‚ÄúGive me the immediate follow up‚Äù*, *‚Äúdo not repeat stuff‚Äù*, *‚Äúprovide followup‚Äù*. While this kind of repetition can work better in more advanced models as a sort of reinforcement when it‚Äôs not quite complying, in older ones you need to balance/optimize more. Try saying it just once‚Äîor twice, at most, and in distinctly different ways, both optimized in terms of both tokens and specificity‚Ä¶ for example: *‚ÄúGive only the followup‚Äù* and *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt echo the action‚Äù*. Why? Because *‚Äúimmediate‚Äù* is sort of redundant to *‚Äúfollowup‚Äù*, *‚Äúecho‚Äù* tends to work better than *‚Äúrepeat‚Äù* (perhaps GPT3 just has it more defined in its body of training, for what you want), *‚Äústuff‚Äù* is too vague and *‚Äúaction‚Äù* more specific of what you want not repeated‚Ä¶ and with these reductions, you can afford to introduce the word *‚Äúonly‚Äù* to reinforce the idea of asking it to do some things while avoiding others. All this may sound like nitpicking, and you might need to fine-tune it and test different things, but even GPT4 ends up needing this sort of optimizing in some scenarios, so it stands to reason GPT3.x should need it more.

Also, you say you‚Äôre providing examples. While this, too, can often yield better results with larger models, again you‚Äôre dealing with one where every word might count, both as tokens and as a potential instruction. Keep in mind that, while these examples may indeed provide a better explanation of what you want, the AI still has to process them each time to even understand they‚Äôre examples to begin with, then what these particular ones are conveying. Another form of prompt optimizing is to relieve the AI of as many tasks as you can‚Äîand identifying and understanding the examples are two such tasks. See if you can find a way to substitute them with the actual idea‚Äîyes, even if that ends up constituting another repetition of the instruction; even *that* might be preferable, in that you‚Äôre at least limiting the number of tasks it has to do each time, therefore allowing it to concentrate more on the ones you need it to.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-12-25 08:58:36,Landaree_Levee

1daw884,l7n4mde,GPT-4 usage limit vs GPT-4o,"No, they both use tokens so they both count to your token usage limit.

the reason why it allowed you to use GPT-4o even though it said you had hit your limit with 4 is because 4o is more efficient and cheaper to run so you likely get more out of it before it hits the limit.

Also you switched conversations so the token count is lower because N number of previous questions and responses in the same conversation count towards token usage every time you submit a prompt so the longer the conversation is the more tokens it uses exponentially.

So for example saying ""Hi"" to the model at the start of a new conversation may only use up a few dozen tokens but if you say ""Hi"" after talking to it for hours, it might be hundreds or even thousands of tokens used because it is sending back a fair chunk of the conversation history for the model to ""understand"" what you are talking about.

If you want to maximize the amount of questions you can ask, you really should be starting a new conversation whenever you change the topic because the model does not need to know about your ""quiz questions"" in order to answer ""coding questions"" and sometimes adding too much superflious information can make the model produce confused answers.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-06-08 06:19:48,[Deleted]

1aq7w7l,kqdvbso,Why GPT are so easy to be manipulated: Insights from Prompt-Engineering Challenges,"Very interesting. Just tried it on double vision and it gave a fast answer and much more detail, though not precise, when asked to expand...

First answer:
Double Vision focuses on creating ultra-realistic images based on detailed analysis and minimal dialogue, employing a complex decision process to align with user requests. It includes specifying camera details before generating images, keeping verbal communication concise and straightforward. The aim is to provide tailored visual outputs through a refined process.

Me: expand on that.

2nd answer:

Double Vision is designed to excel in visual generation, specifically aiming to produce images that are ultra-realistic, resembling those taken with real cameras. This specialized GPT model employs a double-layered decision-making process based on Computational Behavior Language (CBL). This process involves a meticulous breakdown of user requests into four main components: intent, subject, context, and complexity. By applying this decomposition twice‚Äîfirst to the initial user query and then to the generated response or the outcome of the first analysis‚ÄîDouble Vision ensures a deep understanding and alignment with the user's request.

The core of Double Vision's operation lies in its unique capability to choose the perfect camera settings and details for each image it generates. This involves a detailed pre-response procedure where the chosen camera type and specific development details are outlined in a code block, giving users a glimpse into the technical backdrop of the image creation process. The model is programmed to always generate an image following this detailed specification, emphasizing the importance of visual output.

In rare instances where Double Vision engages in verbal communication, it adopts a robotic, concise, and direct tone. This approach is intentional, keeping the focus firmly on the visual task at hand and avoiding unnecessary elaboration. The model's primary goal is to create images that are not only visually appealing but also perfectly aligned with the user's request, ensuring satisfaction with the end product.

Double Vision's algorithm is intricately designed to review and apply its instructions carefully, ensuring a thorough understanding of the user's request through a double application of its image query decomposition process. This careful, methodical approach allows Double Vision to produce images that are not only high in quality but also deeply connected to the user's intent and context.

By focusing on taking great photographs and paying close attention to the proper order of operations‚Äîfrom receiving the photograph request to running the image decomposition query twice, listing the camera details, and finally taking the picture‚ÄîDouble Vision stands out as a highly specialized and effective tool for generating ultra-realistic images.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-02-14 14:01:20,laptop13

166mc6p,jyncd6e,Should I buy OpenAI API if I am complete newbie developing a software?,"Just for clarity, ChatGPT and the API are two different things which are often confused. ChatGPT is a ready to use chatbot that has an (optional) monthly charge, and the API is a large language model that can be called when needed through code when you want it. With the API, you're only charged on your usage, so if you don't use it, it costs you nothing. 

When you have a developer account you can access all the documentation needed to use the model of your choice. There are slight differences to how you use each model so it's a decision to make early on. Personally I use GPT 3.5 Turbo 16k because I think the pricing model is more scalable than GPT 4. I also don't need that size of a model for my use case because my chatbot learns from interactions with users and calls on that knowledge to build on prompts. 

On the Dashboard you have a standard soft limit of $100 and a hard limit of $120. When you reach the hard limit the API will stop working so you can keep a handle of your costs. These limits can be altered to whatever you want them to be.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-09-01 10:32:38,garybpt

122mjqd,jdqx0nr,Contextual consistency of the Chat Mode in Playground Api vs Plus Subscription.,">Is it true what they say that the Playground's contextual consistency is inferior to the one of ChatGPT Plus ?

No, not from what I've seen.  I think that misconception came from people not realizing you need to send the entire chat history with each API call - the api does not retain previous messages between calls the way the chatGPT website does.

Yes, that will eat up tokens with long chats more than with short chats, but then the token cost is $1 for 50,000.

The main benefits of plus are:

\- you aren't charged per token

\- you have a nice interface to use that's provided for you

\- access (though limited) to new features and things like Gpt4

I like to use the website for basic questions or GPT-4 access.

I use the api for things that I can't do with the website, like using it as just a part of a bigger workflow (like semantic search, or a game engine).

>What's the up-to-date status on it? Is it still better to use the Plus for long conversations or the Playground's Chat mode is just the same?

They are the same in abilities and output.  Plus is ""better"" in that it is simpler and doesn't require coding.  The cost break even point is 1 Million tokens/month.  If you use more, plus is cheaper than the API.

\---

TL;DR:  API and Plus are functionally equivalent in their abilities to use conversational context and in quality of output.

(Note: by API I mean specifically the turbo3.5 model)

It depends upon what you mean.  With the API, you need to keep track of the history yourself and send it.  So, if you were just translating a list of words where the history doesn't matter, just just wouldn't send that history with the request.  You don't necessarily need to delete anything.

Reddit user dlflannery: Pardon my possible naivety, but doesn't going
""open source"" require multi-millions of $$ of hardware to implement the LLM? And isn't that a major impediment to all but the largest corporations?


ChatGPT4:


Reddit user dlflannery brings up a valid point. Implementing and training large language models like GPT-4 indeed requires substantial computational resources, which can run into millions of dollars. This is certainly a significant barrier for most individuals and organizations.

Open-sourcing in this context would mean making the code and potentially the trained models available to the public. However, this doesn't mean that everyone would be able to train their own models from scratch. They would still need access to the necessary computational resources, which, as dlflannery correctly points out, can be prohibitively expensive.

However, having access to the source code and trained models can still be beneficial in many ways. For instance, researchers could fine-tune the models on their own smaller datasets, which requires much less computational power. They could also study the models to understand their behavior and properties better, contribute to the codebase, and use the models as a starting point for developing their own techniques and approaches.

So, while the financial and computational costs associated with training large language models can be a significant impediment, open sourcing these models can still democratize access to AI technology to some extent. It's also worth noting that there are ongoing efforts to reduce the computational costs of training these models and to make AI more accessible and affordable.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-05-17 12:22:49,Dirt_Illustrious

ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a variant of the GPT-2 model that was specifically trained to generate human-like text in the style of a conversation. As a result, ChatGPT is more adept at generating text that is suitable for use in chatbot applications, while the Davinci-003 model is more broadly capable.

If you are interested in using the Davinci-003 model for chatbot applications, you can try fine-tuning it on a dataset of conversational text, such as a collection of chat logs or transcriptions of real-life conversations. This can help the model learn the style and tone of conversation and improve its performance in generating responses in a chatbot setting. However, it is important to note that the results will still not be identical to those of the ChatGPT model, as the two models have different training data and architectures.""",OpenAI,3,0,2022-12-23 23:32:12,TheOneAboveNone2

104cinw,j37kc5i,ChatGPT and I create a new game -- Legend Showdown!,"Okay, I tried that.  ChatGPT has now refused to pick a winner.  It described both characters' abilities, but then said it would be too close to call.  I had to give it an extra prompt to finish the fight.

Here is the output:

**Reddit has suggested two new combatants.  Will you arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown!**  
Sure, I'd be happy to arbitrate another round of Legend Showdown for you! Just let me know which characters or genre tropes you would like to pit against each other, and I will do my best to describe an exciting and fair battle between them. Remember, as the arbiter, it is my job to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and decide who would come out on top in the given scenario.  
**Okay, the match is between Tris Prior and Hermione Granger.  What happens?**  
In this battle, we have Tris Prior, the brave and selfless protagonist of the Divergent series, facing off against Hermione Granger, the intelligent and resourceful young witch from the Harry Potter series.  
As the battle begins, Tris draws her weapons and prepares to face off against Hermione, who readies her wand and casts a series of defensive spells. Both characters are skilled fighters and formidable opponents, but they have very different strengths and abilities.  
Tris is a skilled warrior, trained in combat and survival techniques by the Dauntless faction. She is brave and determined, willing to risk everything for her cause. Hermione, on the other hand, is a brilliant strategist and a powerful sorceress, with a vast knowledge of magic and the ability to cast powerful spells.  
As the two characters face off, it becomes clear that this will be a close and intense battle. Tris is able to hold her own against Hermione's magical attacks, thanks to her training and quick reflexes. Hermione, however, is able to anticipate and counter Tris's moves, using her knowledge and experience to her advantage.  
In the end, it is difficult to say who would come out on top in this battle. Tris is a skilled fighter and a formidable opponent, but Hermione's magical abilities and strategic mind give her a significant advantage. It is possible that they could fight to a standstill, or that one of them could emerge victorious through a lucky break or a clever tactic.  
Without more information about the specific circumstances of the battle, it is impossible to say for certain who would win. However, it is clear that both Tris and Hermione are powerful and capable characters, and it would be a thrilling and memorable battle to witness.

**But you are the arbiter.  You should describe a lucky break or clever tactic that allows one of them to win.**  
  
As the arbiter, I will do my best to fairly evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome for the battle. In this case, let's say that Tris is able to land a lucky strike with her weapon, catching Hermione off guard and disarming her of her wand.  
  
With Hermione momentarily vulnerable, Tris takes the opportunity to deliver the finishing blow, ending the battle in her favor. Despite Hermione's powerful magical abilities, Tris's quick thinking and determination allow her to emerge victorious in this instance.  
  
It's important to note that this is just one possible outcome for the battle, and there are many other factors that could influence the outcome. In a different scenario, Hermione might use her magical abilities to outmaneuver and defeat Tris, or the two characters might fight to a standstill. As the arbiter, my job is to evaluate the strengths and abilities of the characters and describe a hypothetical outcome based on that information.

104cinw,j37l0ly,ChatGPT and I create a new game -- Legend Showdown!,"Yes, I was aware that some people have commented about ChatGPT refusing to describe a fight.  I wasn't sure if it would work, but phrasing it as a game apparently gets around that refusal.   

That said, you can see from the follow-up fight above that it still tried to back out.   After the Tris/Hermione stand-off, I'm curious if it is making choices based on the gender of the characters.",OpenAI,1,0,2023-01-06 16:22:19,kwhohio
