m1vfqff,1hded7u,"It would be awesome if more people used gemini, but the comparison is pretty weird. Gemini is nowhere near close to o1, and o1 pro is leagues ahead of it. Maybe if you want to say that if someone hits the limit, they should use gemini instead of o1-mini, that would be fair, but otherwise, the models are not very comparable, especially if you use o1-pro for work and it actually pays to spend 200 dollars per month.",2024-12-13 15:44:48,Ormusn2o

It seems on part with Claude for most things I tried,  it without the limits. I don't know if my actual Android phone Gemini app is outdated, but I get better results in AI Studio. I thought the Gemini app was already using 2.0 Flash? But with that being said, AI Studio is crazy good for what you get for free. The token limit alone is insane, like 1million per chat. I was going back and forth in chat and telling it to keep iterating and updating features and it was like 20k tokens. I never really broke a sweat, super fast and completed code blocks. I might actually pay for Gemini Advanced if it means getting more functionality out of AI Studio. I still need to try the experimental model more though it seems slightly slower than Flash.

Obviously, you wouldn't put experimental tools into stuff you're telling people just living their lives to use. When they do put AI in stuff it usually has some sort of ""Gemini"" branding.

Meanwhile, Sora is also branded independently the same way that Google's video AI has the YouTube branding.

From what I can tell these are just your average Deepmind researchers (hint: they are all insanely talented).

m2an2dz,1hded7u,"Sonnet has Limited context on these products, and with Sonnet IMO their prompting makes worse or some limited answers. I was using API Sonnet (200k context) with something like Aider, has been best for Sonnet and aider for overrall usability.

But now since O1 Pro,  I now use only Aider as an ""editor"" and copy-paste to/from O1 Pro as being ""architect"", has been best.

Gemini is good as an editor, but not good as an ""architect"". For architect O1 Pro has been amazing, good iterative debugging abilities, example Sonnet could not ""think on it's own"", you could run circles with bugs, O1 Pro tries to think more on every next response, gemini is not on their level for the architect, not so good, but good editor.  [Aider LLM Leaderboards | aider](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/)

EDIT: Also when gemini fails on being editor only, I could use deepseek as this is the next (or on some code styles even better) and if this fails too then Sonnet seems to be a bit smarter on more complicated edits (while O1 Pro is the architect). Best results as of today, might change tommorrow.",2024-12-16 06:50:36,Gas_Silent

Cursor is a fork of VS Code (they took the existing VS Code and built on top of it) that supports integrated AI for development. ChatGPT canvas is a web-based version of something similar, but much simpler. A proper IDE will do everything from linting (auto-correct for code which enforces coding style and prevents many errors from typos) and being able to run the program from inside the IDE.

So the short version is ChatGPT Canvas is a very simplistic web-based code editor, whereas Cursor is a full-featured IDE

m1y6owd,1hded7u,"Not to my knowledge, which is the only reason I probably won’t get a Gemini subscription when Ultra 2.0 comes out. Which is kind of a shame. While the experimental models can use your prompts for training, I’d kill to have the full version of 1206 in a private subscription.
While ChatGPT Plus doesn’t have an automatic opt-out of training, either, it at least has the option tucked away.",2024-12-14 00:58:37,WorriedPiano740

m2i5uj9,1hded7u,"What is confusing in my comment? As I wrote, Gemini (the free version) refuses to connect to the web for roughly 2/3 my queries and says it’s unable to do so. If I tell it that it can in fact do this (“you told me you can now search the web”), it normally then does it and provides a response to the prompt. It’s very weird.",2024-12-17 15:17:09,eloquenentic

I can't recall all the chat models you get access to, but I know there's Claude, all the OpenAI models, Gemini, etc.

There's also limits (as you'd expect since it's only 20 bucks a month) Like 500 request per month or something.

You can also provide your own API keys if you want.",2024-12-14 21:08:06,athermop
