I thought the Gemini app was already using 2.0 Flash? But with that being said, AI Studio is crazy good for what you get for free. The token limit alone is insane, like 1million per chat. I was going back and forth in chat and telling it to keep iterating and updating features and it was like 20k tokens. I never really broke a sweat, super fast and completed code blocks. I might actually pay for Gemini Advanced if it means getting more functionality out of AI Studio. I still need to try the experimental model more though it seems slightly slower than Flash. I think people are sleeping on it, I honestly think Google caught up to ChatGPT and Claude with this release.",

From what I can tell these are just your average Deepmind researchers (hint: they are all insanely talented).\n\nOther teams within google are probably productionizing their research (why would you have the person writing the transformer paper that OpenAI is based on leading the productionization) and they are probably trying to figure out which products will stick",

But it's a flash, so yep it's still very limited. Pro 2.0 should logically be a very strong competition to o1 and sonnet 3.5 when it's released.\n (And unlike what was said in some comments, I don't thi k exp1206 is a pre 2.0 version at all).",

I was using API Sonnet (200k context) with something like Aider, has been best for Sonnet and aider for overrall usability.\n\nBut now since O1 Pro,  I now use only Aider as an \"editor\" and copy-paste to/from O1 Pro as being \"architect\", has been best.\n\nGemini is good as an editor, but not good as an \"architect\". For architect O1 Pro has been amazing, good iterative debugging abilities, example Sonnet could not \"think on it's own\", you could run circles with bugs, O1 Pro tries to think more on every next response, gemini is not on their level for the architect, not so good, but good editor.  [Aider LLM Leaderboards | aider](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/)\n\nEDIT: Also when gemini fails on being editor only, I could use deepseek as this is the next (or on some code styles even better) and if this fails too then Sonnet seems to be a bit smarter on more complicated edits (while O1 Pro is the architect). Best results as of today, might change tommorrow.",
