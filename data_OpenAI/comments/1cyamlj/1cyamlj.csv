No wonder the superalignment team dissolved, given this is where OpenAI's priorities are.

To think someone at the top really saw this opportunity, knew exactly how intelligent and persuasive their up-and-coming models can be, and greenlit this idea, while having the gall to call it an enhancement... How is this at all aligned with OpenAI's mission and values?

l5bwcup,1cyamlj,"Ladies and gentlemen. We are at a crossroads as a society. Carl Sagan once said ""*We've arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces, I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don't know anything about it?*”

Technology companies in a very sneaky way become part of our lives. There was a time in which you had the option to opt out of a technology service. Now, as technology permeates our world, technology companies in an effort to valuate their stock or their potential IPOs, they pursue this inter-company deals.

Whether it's OpenAI with Murdoch and co. Or Google, or Microsoft. Little by little they work to make our world more and more dependent on them. But this process is not direct. They will work tirelessly with every other company on the planet to enslave us and make us use their technology.

Often, it will be said that it is benign, that it ""*will make our lives easier and better*"". But the reality is that, this will not be the case. The reality is that these companies are not driven by an altruistic goal. Believe me when I tell you, these companies will design their platforms with only one goal: engagement.

Just like ratings of a TV show, their only goal is to attract more and more users. Users that will provide now more than ever, in a very intimate way all the details of their life. Technology companies have become the Professor X of our times. They are connected to us and we are connected to them, through their innovative ways that dazzle us. As their algorithms help us release more and more dopamine, with every like, with every comment, we become providers of data, depicting in every comment, every picture, every video, relevant information that they use to turn us into algorithm junkies.

As junkies, we, and by we I mean society. We are helpeless. There is no rehab center for us. Technically, we should be protected by our elected officials. But as explained in [this](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-government) article, regulation appears to be slow and ignorance about the repercussions of AI is rampant.

OpenAi's decision to choose one of the best well-known anti-regulatory media is definitely premeditated because it is convenient. Imagine ChatGPT parroting articles that seek to align us with ideas that are for the benefit of OpenAi and their future shareholders. It stands to reason that we will be swayed into thinking that regulation and even accountability will somehow ""hinder"" innovation.

My hope is that as this strategic business mistakes are noticed by those that like me are skeptical of AI, just as we should have been of social media. It is my hope that our elected representatives we raise to the ocassion and say NO. We must protect the average citizen by passing laws that rein in artificial intelligence training models. We must find a way to further protect ourselves from this artificial codependency that is being created to enslave us. To make us think that we need them as they continue embedding not only in our lives, but in our very own psyche, changing the way we think, the way we view the world.

I don't see how this will make GPT less biased. This is the only deal so far, which means GPT has special access to a right-leaning source, and no special access to a similar left leaning source. I don't see this as a problem if:

1. They sign more deals with other left or moderate sources.

l59cz0e,1cyamlj,"News of the World was a British tabloid newspaper owned by News Corporation (now known as News Corp), a media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch.

It was involved in the illegal hacking of phone voicemails by News of the World journalists, including those of celebrities, politicians, and even murder victims. This led to a major public outcry, investigations, and ultimately the closure of the newspaper in 2011. The scandal also had broader implications for News Corp., with investigations and legal actions extending to other parts of the company.

You can find more information about the scandal on Wikipedia:

Especially if details aren't made transparent, there are lots of ways to subtly favor Newsmax's goals over those of latecomers.

The open unscientific bias and broadsides Newsmax is known for will look like a threat to competitors.  The largest competitors have their own political jockeying but nowhere near the investment in climate change denial or stances on discrimination that keep aging badly.  This is a good play to threaten other news media to come to the table that they've rejected (or are suing over because negotiations broke down).

l5sntoh,1cyamlj,"The argument I was making is that there are some countries with CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera that have healthy democracies (like various countries in Europe), whereas there are no countries which have the presence of a News Corp subsidiary without also having severe democratic backslide and political toxicity as a consequence. 

This contrast demonstrates how one is more damaging than the other. Does this make sense to you now? 

Seperately, do you mind if I give you some advice on how to make your point more effectively? I used to compete in intercollegiate debate when I was younger, so I think I can help you since you're struggling a bit.

You need to apply logical reasoning to support your arguments. You're making a bunch of logical fallacies that make your argument sound weak (without me even really needing to make much of a counter point) and overall makes you look as of you don't know what you're talking about. 

I'm willing to give benefit of the doubt that there's a better version of the argument you're trying to make, but the way you're making defending your position now just comes across totally irrational. 

For example, the claim ""there are countries om the Middle East without Fox News / News Corp that do not have functioning democracies"" does not support the argument ""News Corp doesn't damage democracy"". It just supports the argument ""there are other things which can hurt democracy too"" (which I agree with you on) but your argument is far more specific than that, so you should make an attempt to defend your actual argument. 

Furthermore ""Al Jazeera operates in Qatar, and Qatar is not democratic"" doesn't support the argument ""Al Jazeera damages democracy"" because it doesn't prove Al Jazeera is the reason why Qatar is not democratic (in fact Qatar has had its current form of government since before Al Jazeera ever existed, which suggests that there isn't a causal link)

Let's reel things back a bit to see how your position got so muddled. 

You made the argument that news sources like Al Jazeera and BBC are as damaging or more damaging than News Corp for democracy.

You made this argument in response to the claim that every country where News Corp operates has had democratic backslide, a claim that you didn't contest.

But then you didn't really follow through on your own position. 

So here's my first suggestion for you:

In order to support your claim, you might want to argue something like ""every country where BBC or Al Jazeera has begun to operate has experienced a backslide in their democracy"".

Try coming up with specific examples of countries which HAD strong democracies, up until CNN, BBC, and/or Al Jazeera began operating there. Paint a clear picture of what those news channels did that had a negative impact of those countries.

Second piece of advice:

Ask questions to understand the other side's position for you can better argue against it. I made the argument that there are countries where CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera operate that have healthy democracies. 

For some reason you randomly assumed I was thinking of Qatar and let that completely distract you from the actual topic, making you look bad.

Instead, you could try asking me to give a specific example of a coutry that has a healthy democracy despite the presence of these news channels. 

If you asked this question, I might respond with something like Sweden or the Netherlands.

This would then give the opportunity to make the best version of your argument by presenting an explaination of how those countries actually were damaged by news channels like BBC or whatever, which would be a far more persuasive argument than going on a unrelated rant about religious monarchies.

I hope you find this helpful. I think we can have  much higher quality discourse if you take these suggestions. 

Let me know if you have any questions and/or if you want to rewrite your response and we can resume the discussion we were having before.",2024-05-26 21:01:09,maneo

l5d3xip,1cyamlj,"> Why does the AI need fake news at all?

I will admit that I’m not very knowledgeable about this topic, so it’s hard for me to provide an answer. I will say though-I find it interesting why a big company like Meta would teach AI how to lie. I feel it relates to this a bit, because if AI is good at lying while being very convincing, and they also feed the AI with fake news, the AI can really get good at creating news or convince people a lie if they want to.

Maybe it’s just about getting an AI that acts as realistic as possible, I’m not sure where they’re going with this.",2024-05-23 18:59:14,No-Conference-8133
l5bksre,1cyamlj,I’m centrist. Everyone knows CNN is leaning heavily to the left. Let me guess there are no left wing news outlets?,2024-05-23 13:38:36,[Deleted]
l5civbx,1cyamlj,"You're not getting my point at all... These sources are enough to spread a message through pretty much the entire society: you'll hear the same things from people of various ways of life, who encountered it in their own little bubble (Fox, Vogue, WSJ: mostly disjoint sets of audience). You'll perceive it as ""everyone is saying the same thing; it must be true!"" even if you yourself haven't read it in any of those outlets.",2024-05-23 16:59:01,timtom85
l5b6gdi,1cyamlj,"Sure, it’s hard to explain. Can you remind me with a follow up after I try it for a bit longer? Early impressions is that you have to be more instructive?

E.g I told ChatGPT and Gemini to make a budget sheet and Gemini made it, sure, but it didn’t make a table unlike ChatGPT. That’s just one example of course.",2024-05-23 11:54:02,Admirable-Lie-9191
l5bly5c,1cyamlj,"Oh there’s plenty of left wing news outlets. CNN isn’t one of them, it’s a profit driven network whose primary bias is toward negativity. It’s not ideological. Left wing could be argued to be MSNBC or print sources like Jacobin or CommonDreams.

You have to be right leaning to see CNN as ideological at all.",2024-05-23 13:45:59,WhiteBoyWithAPodcast
l5clmy8,1cyamlj,"But it's just not true that you'll get ""everyone is saying the same thing"" except in some bubbles. Not many of the people who had heard those things you are thinking about hadn't also heard the other narratives. You think most climate deniers haven't heard that climate change is real? Or that Trump election deniers haven't heard ""it was fair and there's no evidence of fraud""? Or that people who think the covid vaccines are deadly haven't heard ""they are safe and that's a conspiracy theory""?",2024-05-23 17:15:01,JalabolasFernandez

l5c4or8,1cyamlj,"Correct, particularly negativity bias. CNN has a negativity bias but it’s not an ideological outlet. Your issue is thinking anything not explicitly right wing is by definition left, which is not how it works. 

Judging by the subs you frequent it’s quite clear you’re on the right.",2024-05-23 15:38:11,WhiteBoyWithAPodcast
l5c77j5,1cyamlj,"Negativity bias is something different and not what’s being discussed here. CNN clearly has a both socially and economically left leaning, political bias, which any balanced person could tell you. 

You clearly have a binary mind. It’s perfectly possible not to subscribe to a political package deal. One can in fact be for example socially right and economically left, which makes labeling someone based on virtually nothing particularly ignorant.",2024-05-23 15:52:36,[Deleted]
l5cb9ji,1cyamlj,"CNN doesn’t lean either way because it’s not ideological. It’s coded as left by people on the right only. Also a ‘balanced’ person is a meaningless term. Hyperpartisans consider themselves “balanced”nor do some topics need to be covered in a way that doesn’t upset/offend the sensibilities of partisans. 

Again, CNN is not left because it’s explicitly right. The only bias you can even accuse CNN of is negativity. 

> You clearly have a binary mind 

Ironic considering I’m the arguing CNN isn’t left or right leaning but you are. Also, social vs economic views being distinct in your worldview is another giveaway.",2024-05-23 16:15:44,WhiteBoyWithAPodcast
l5ccuci,1cyamlj,"It’s not ironic because as we discussed all media have a political bias, and if you aren’t mature enough to admit it you agree with it. Stating this isn’t binary, it means one has the capacity to see reality for what it is.

Social and economical views cant be separated? That’s something even the most radical activists I’ve talked to would disagree with. And of course you end with placing another binary judgement.",2024-05-23 16:24:46,[Deleted]
