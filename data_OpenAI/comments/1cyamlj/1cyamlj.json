        "body": "Ladies and gentlemen. We are at a crossroads as a society. Carl Sagan once said \"*We've arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces, I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don't know anything about it?*\u201d\n\nTechnology companies in a very sneaky way become part of our lives. There was a time in which you had the option to opt out of a technology service. Now, as technology permeates our world, technology companies in an effort to valuate their stock or their potential IPOs, they pursue this inter-company deals.\n\nWhether it's OpenAI with Murdoch and co. Or Google, or Microsoft. Little by little they work to make our world more and more dependent on them. But this process is not direct. They will work tirelessly with every other company on the planet to enslave us and make us use their technology.\n\nOften, it will be said that it is benign, that it \"*will make our lives easier and better*\". But the reality is that, this will not be the case. The reality is that these companies are not driven by an altruistic goal. Believe me when I tell you, these companies will design their platforms with only one goal: engagement.\n\nJust like ratings of a TV show, their only goal is to attract more and more users. Users that will provide now more than ever, in a very intimate way all the details of their life. Technology companies have become the Professor X of our times. They are connected to us and we are connected to them, through their innovative ways that dazzle us. As their algorithms help us release more and more dopamine, with every like, with every comment, we become providers of data, depicting in every comment, every picture, every video, relevant information that they use to turn us into algorithm junkies.\n\nAs junkies, we, and by we I mean society. We are helpeless. There is no rehab center for us. Technically, we should be protected by our elected officials. But as explained in [this](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-government) article, regulation appears to be slow and ignorance about the repercussions of AI is rampant.\n\nOpenAi's decision to choose one of the best well-known anti-regulatory media is definitely premeditated because it is convenient. Imagine ChatGPT parroting articles that seek to align us with ideas that are for the benefit of OpenAi and their future shareholders. It stands to reason that we will be swayed into thinking that regulation and even accountability will somehow \"hinder\" innovation.\n\nMy hope is that as this strategic business mistakes are noticed by those that like me are skeptical of AI, just as we should have been of social media. It is my hope that our elected representatives we raise to the ocassion and say NO. We must protect the average citizen by passing laws that rein in artificial intelligence training models. We must find a way to further protect ourselves from this artificial codependency that is being created to enslave us. To make us think that we need them as they continue embedding not only in our lives, but in our very own psyche, changing the way we think, the way we view the world.\n\nImagine Morpheus telling Neo \"The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world, built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.\" \\[holding a chip labeled RLHF\\]\"",

There's a lot with ChatGPT that I'm looking forward to, but I'll drop out of supporting them and cancel my subscription too if this goes forward.\n\nLast thing we need is for ChatGPT to be trained on a \"news\" source that had to shell out almost a BILLION Dollars because their leading talking head was a liar. And who repeatedly have to defend themselves in court by arguing \"no reasonable person would believe them anyway.\".\n\n/u/samaltman this seems like a really terrible way forward. You guys really need to rethink this.",

By being first Newsmax has dictated terms that competition will need to match to be represented on future AIs.  Especially if details aren't made transparent, there are lots of ways to subtly favor Newsmax's goals over those of latecomers.\n\nThe open unscientific bias and broadsides Newsmax is known for will look like a threat to competitors.  The largest competitors have their own political jockeying but nowhere near the investment in climate change denial or stances on discrimination that keep aging badly.  This is a good play to threaten other news media to come to the table that they've rejected (or are suing over because negotiations broke down).

        "body": "The argument I was making is that there are some countries with CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera that have healthy democracies (like various countries in Europe), whereas there are no countries which have the presence of a News Corp subsidiary without also having severe democratic backslide and political toxicity as a consequence. \n\nThis contrast demonstrates how one is more damaging than the other. Does this make sense to you now? \n\nSeperately, do you mind if I give you some advice on how to make your point more effectively? I used to compete in intercollegiate debate when I was younger, so I think I can help you since you're struggling a bit.\n\nYou need to apply logical reasoning to support your arguments. You're making a bunch of logical fallacies that make your argument sound weak (without me even really needing to make much of a counter point) and overall makes you look as of you don't know what you're talking about. \n\nI'm willing to give benefit of the doubt that there's a better version of the argument you're trying to make, but the way you're making defending your position now just comes across totally irrational. \n\nFor example, the claim \"there are countries om the Middle East without Fox News / News Corp that do not have functioning democracies\" does not support the argument \"News Corp doesn't damage democracy\". It just supports the argument \"there are other things which can hurt democracy too\" (which I agree with you on) but your argument is far more specific than that, so you should make an attempt to defend your actual argument. \n\nFurthermore \"Al Jazeera operates in Qatar, and Qatar is not democratic\" doesn't support the argument \"Al Jazeera damages democracy\" because it doesn't prove Al Jazeera is the reason why Qatar is not democratic (in fact Qatar has had its current form of government since before Al Jazeera ever existed, which suggests that there isn't a causal link)\n\nLet's reel things back a bit to see how your position got so muddled. \n\nYou made the argument that news sources like Al Jazeera and BBC are as damaging or more damaging than News Corp for democracy.\n\nYou made this argument in response to the claim that every country where News Corp operates has had democratic backslide, a claim that you didn't contest.\n\nBut then you didn't really follow through on your own position. \n\nSo here's my first suggestion for you:\n\nIn order to support your claim, you might want to argue something like \"every country where BBC or Al Jazeera has begun to operate has experienced a backslide in their democracy\".\n\nTry coming up with specific examples of countries which HAD strong democracies, up until CNN, BBC, and/or Al Jazeera began operating there. Paint a clear picture of what those news channels did that had a negative impact of those countries.\n\nSecond piece of advice:\n\nAsk questions to understand the other side's position for you can better argue against it. I made the argument that there are countries where CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera operate that have healthy democracies. \n\nFor some reason you randomly assumed I was thinking of Qatar and let that completely distract you from the actual topic, making you look bad.\n\nInstead, you could try asking me to give a specific example of a coutry that has a healthy democracy despite the presence of these news channels. \n\nIf you asked this question, I might respond with something like Sweden or the Netherlands.\n\nThis would then give the opportunity to make the best version of your argument by presenting an explaination of how those countries actually were damaged by news channels like BBC or whatever, which would be a far more persuasive argument than going on a unrelated rant about religious monarchies.\n\nI hope you find this helpful. I think we can have  much higher quality discourse if you take these suggestions. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions and/or if you want to rewrite your response and we can resume the discussion we were having before.",
