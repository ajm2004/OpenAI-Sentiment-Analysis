So that would give you the narrowest you can go.  \nI don't know man I just really feel like there can be equally good choices in most circumstances. We certainly recognise this with people. Two experts in a field can typically be easily differentiated with just TFIDF, but could write equally good overviews of a topic. I just don't think \"quality\" comes down to the exact correct words being used and has much more to do with semantics. Is the LLM trying to convey the correct thing or not? Within that there's lots of room for variation on the words used while still being correct.",

They're useful for things like figuring out who leaked pre-release movie screeners.\n\nIn the case of AI generated text, the general public would have access to the watermark detector. It would be pretty trivial to put together a machine learning model that figures out how to reliably remove the watermark.
