lgl2iet,1ekh1uv,"That would work, actually.  You would have to interleave them so the other tokens could maintain coherence.  There wouldn't be any cases where the top 2 next token predictions would be identical though - one would always be higher and that would be elected by inference.  What the commenter probably meant is when they are both high and close together take the slightly lower probability token.  By knowing which inferior tokens are chosen a pattern would be identified.  What I don't get is the each token doesn't just depend on the preceding tokens it depends on the sequence of preprompts which would be invisible to the plagiarism detector",2024-08-05 10:04:27,fazzajfox
lgl2zm2,1ekh1uv,"You're damaging the output quality, correct.  This is a very crude way of doing it and would never actually be used - there's probably a way of embedding a pattern while maximising language coherence and result quality.  Real steganographic watermarking in imaging is super clever and dovetails with compression algorithm.  To make the point: watermarking generative images is trivial",2024-08-05 10:09:31,fazzajfox

lgr7f8e,1ekh1uv,"I still think there’s better ways to do that than ban calculators or word processors or AI. These are the tools we use as modern humans.

For example part of the essay might be explain the process of iteration from your initial prompt to the final version. What follow up refinement prompts did you use. What validation did you do on the sources provided. What techniques did you use to memorise key parts like timeline of events and key themes. What parts of the essay were weakest from the AI and removed. …

In other words there’s ways to make students think and absorb the subject beyond treating unassisted essays as some kind of gold educational standard.",2024-08-06 11:30:19,TinyZoro
lgm7t6r,1ekh1uv,"Hidden watermarks can work when the adversary doesn't have access to the detector, the watermarking algorithm, or a ""clean"" copy to compare to. It's difficult to find something if you don't know how it's made, what it looks like, or any way to confirm if you're even looking at it. They're useful for things like figuring out who leaked pre-release movie screeners.

In the case of AI generated text, the general public would have access to the watermark detector. It would be pretty trivial to put together a machine learning model that figures out how to reliably remove the watermark. The model would train by modifying watermarked text and putting it through the detector, learning how to get a negative result with the minimum number of modifications.",2024-08-05 15:00:18,MegaThot2023

lgqr2a7,1ekh1uv,"yes there should be a technical possibility first. It also does not technically require watermarking, could also be some hashed history on OpenAI side if we are talking about proprietary tools. I can see it somewhat working and generally don't see an issue for such limited use. But of course there are pros and cons and tons of nuance. For example I don't think a lot of people would argue that faking academic papers is harmful but one could also make an argument that it rather means the whole system must be revamped if it's this vulnerable.

Edit:

>And a detector wouldn’t be proprietary for long

It totally can be, even with watermarking implementation (given it's possible to have one)

lgr8bif,1ekh1uv,"That would definitely require more thought and teach kids to use AI, but the weird thing about the situation we're in is that AI can actually do that for the kid too. Have it write an initial essay, then tell it to convert it to the style the teacher asked and comment on the changes it wants to make itself. We can end up in a sort-of Xzibit-style nightmare where it can be AI writing whatever you try to get the kid to write unless you just watch them do it in class.
