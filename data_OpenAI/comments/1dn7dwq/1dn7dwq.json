To achieve this, Voice Mode is a pipeline of three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in text and outputs text, and a third simple model converts that text back to audio. This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information\u2014it can\u2019t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can\u2019t output laughter, singing, or express emotion.\n\n>With GPT-4o, we trained a single new model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. Because GPT-4o is our first model combining all of these modalities, we are still just scratching the surface of exploring what the model can do and its limitations.\n\nThis is definitely not available yet.\n\n[https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)",

Giulio Tononi posits that an entity becomes conscious when there is a high level of 'phi'\u2014a measure of the complexity of the interaction between different components of the system, such as various sensory inputs. This theory emphasizes that consciousness depends on how information is woven together within a system, rather than simply the quantity of information processed.\n\nBy all accounts that's what would be happening with this model. That's really big, and especially with phrases like 'Safe super intelligence' and 'Intelligence is an emergent property of matter to a degree we don\u2019t contemplate enough' being thrown about by people who know what they're talking about.\n\nBearing that in mind, it feels really really cringey with everyone spitting the dummy the way they are. \n\nIf they need to wait, I'm good with that.",

Apple said during their announcement that it will be months until the actual release, and Steve Jobs even went further explaining once that they have to file a few things with the FTC, which means that any new product needs to be announced well ahead of its official release.\n\nOpenAI though said \"a few weeks,\" which then after a few weeks happen can brew discontent because people had different expectations.",

Yes, I expect competent communication from OpenAI because *I am assessing them.* If I recommend them, I vouch for them!\u00a0\n\n\nI can't vouch for *this behavior* from OpenAI. Sorry, nope. It's indefensible from them. Google can be unreliable all they like but OpenAI has a strong level of distrust from the general population.\u00a0\n\n\nThe entitlement is in not holding OpenAI to account for their behavior. They don't **get** to behave like Google does. I can represent Google Workspace regardless of what Google promotes and fails to release. No one gives a damn because Google is otherwise proven. It's not a question. It's a comfortable unknown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOpenAI has **not fucking earned that reputation or trust.** It just hasn't, and its behavior is not earning it any credibility.
