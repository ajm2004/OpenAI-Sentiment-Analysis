Kling, no announcement. Runway Gen 3, no announcement. SORA, announcement with no delivery.

>Prior to GPT-4o, you could use [~Voice Mode~](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak) to talk to ChatGPT with latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. To achieve this, Voice Mode is a pipeline of three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in text and outputs text, and a third simple model converts that text back to audio. This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information‚Äîit can‚Äôt directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can‚Äôt output laughter, singing, or express emotion.

>With GPT-4o, we trained a single new model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. Because GPT-4o is our first model combining all of these modalities, we are still just scratching the surface of exploring what the model can do and its limitations.

This is definitely not available yet.

I'm not sure many people know this but this model would effectively be the first real working example of a theory (I had to look it up, I forgot, 'Integrated Information Theory) of how actual real consciousness is of formed. Giulio Tononi posits that an entity becomes conscious when there is a high level of 'phi'‚Äîa measure of the complexity of the interaction between different components of the system, such as various sensory inputs. This theory emphasizes that consciousness depends on how information is woven together within a system, rather than simply the quantity of information processed.

By all accounts that's what would be happening with this model. That's really big, and especially with phrases like 'Safe super intelligence' and 'Intelligence is an emergent property of matter to a degree we don‚Äôt contemplate enough' being thrown about by people who know what they're talking about.

la20zkj,1dn7dwq,"Nah you're just wrong.

You can grand stand like that all you like but the cool thing about openai before sora is that wasn't true. Instead of telling you loads of vapor ware they would jusr drop awesome stuff. Which meant you could actually get moving and sell that awesome stuff.

I don't know what you do for a living but this isn't video games where it's about people being butt hurt or not. It's about lots of people making large amounts of money for openai and Claude in the aggregate.

We're seeing more and more enterprises move to Claude. We're seeing lots of stories like the professor above who got burnt.

You can act like a child if you want and talk about it in terms of feelings. But however wicked sick your burns are on openai's potential customers are, it won't make them insulted into a customer again.

I'm finding it harder and harder to sell openai to anyone compared to other companies and models.",2024-06-24 14:47:16,yautja_cetanu

Me, I think spending money with the understanding that the feature was imminent gives OP every right to feel misled, (as I do). 

More important, though... to my way of looking at things, even if you disagree that OpenAI had implied their 4o voice/conversation feature was imminent, it still is weird to get so emotional/rude to swear at an internet stranger over the misunderstanding.",2024-06-24 19:26:12,FaithElephant

First of all, not to be nitpicking, but if people bought it when the demo was out they are paying already 40$ on a service they didn't get.

That may seem irrelevant to you, but it's not just the money - which some people work hard for and have the right not to be scammed out of, it's also the principle.

If I bought a 40$ game and it didn't work as advertised - I deserve a refund. Period.

I watched that on the clock, because I've made keeping up on AI a part of my job. I have *high expectations* of a company I could be recommending to my employers. Yes, I expect competent communication from OpenAI because *I am assessing them.* If I recommend them, I vouch for them!¬†


I can't vouch for *this behavior* from OpenAI. Sorry, nope. It's indefensible from them. Google can be unreliable all they like but OpenAI has a strong level of distrust from the general population.¬†


The entitlement is in not holding OpenAI to account for their behavior. They don't **get** to behave like Google does. I can represent Google Workspace regardless of what Google promotes and fails to release. No one gives a damn because Google is otherwise proven. It's not a question. It's a comfortable unknown.¬†¬†

- Whether OP was correct to feel misled...  (My opinion is there's a fair case there.

Everyone is free to disagree and say it was a misunderstanding.)

- 'rights'. I don't think I invented the concept of consumer rights, but again, sure... maybe a bad word choice. If you want to substitute 'It feels reasonable for OP to be frustrated' for 'OP has a right to feel frustrated' that's fair. I stand by the essence of it... The frustration seems reasonable to me.
