        "body": "my 13 year old is trying to get out of a trip to see grandpa this saturday. He sent me this: Spring break is an exciting time for many students, but I have mixed feelings about it this year. While I'm grateful for the opportunity to take a break from school and recharge, I'm not looking forward to the planned trip to my grandfather's house. In fact, I believe that staying home for one day of spring break is a better decision for me, and here's why:\nFirstly, the trip would disrupt my schedule and routine. As a student, I thrive on structure and routine, and I've worked hard to establish a productive daily routine that helps me stay on track with my goals. Being away from home, even for a day, would mean abandoning my routine and risking falling behind on my schoolwork and other commitments. Additionally, traveling can be stressful and tiring, which would leave me feeling drained and unable to enjoy the rest of my spring break.\nSecondly, staying home would enable me to pursue activities that I enjoy and find fulfilling. For example, I've been meaning to catch up on some reading, explore a nearby hiking trail, and spend time with friends who live in the area. These activities would not only bring me joy and relaxation, but also contribute to my personal growth and well-being.\nLastly, I believe that staying home for one day would help me maintain a healthy work-life balance. As a student, it's easy to get caught up in academic and extracurricular pursuits and neglect other areas of my life, such as my relationships and self-care. Staying home would allow me to prioritize these areas and ensure that I'm not neglecting my overall well-being.\nIn conclusion, while I understand the importance of spending time with family, I believe that staying home for one day over spring break is a better decision for me. It would enable me to maintain my routine, pursue activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.",

We have also been discussing AI, its rapid advances of late, and rewatching Her, Bicentennial Man, Ex Machina, AI, etc.  I\u2019m a schoolteacher and she\u2019s an HR executive so the tech touches both of our lives.  \n\nAnyway, she had claimed she couldn\u2019t ever mistake AI-generated writing for me.  So\u2026\n\nI fed a few paragraphs of my writing into GPT and prompted it to mimic my style and language uses on future prompt.  I then fed it this:  My wife and I have both been wanting to get closer.  We\u2019ve been married xx years and nothing is really bad but we need a little more closeness.  Generate a letter from me to her expressing this idea in a loving way.  \n\nThen I took the output (which was VERY much me and spot on) and altered the greeting and sign-off to reflect the names we use for one another.  All of this just to demonstrate.\n\nShe had to concede that if this had not been an open experiment, she would not have known.  This technology is very good.  It\u2019s a little disconcerting at times.  \n\nI hereby testify this post was entirely written by my 50+ year-old thumbs on my phone.",

I expect more from you as my partner, and I find it hard to believe that you truly value our marriage if you can't even take the time to apologize sincerely.\n\nIf you genuinely want to repair our relationship and rebuild trust, you need to step up and be honest with yourself and with me. I can't accept an insincere apology, and I have little hope for us moving forward if you continue to avoid genuine communication.\n\nI challenge you to take the time to reflect on your actions and write a heartfelt apology in your own words. Until then, I'll have a hard time believing that you're genuinely committed to making things right between us.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]",

As a student, I thrive on structure and routine, and I've worked hard to establish a productive daily routine that helps me stay on track with my goals. Being away from home, even for a day, would mean abandoning my routine and risking falling behind on my schoolwork and other commitments. Additionally, traveling can be stressful and tiring, which would leave me feeling drained and unable to enjoy the rest of my spring break.\n> \n> Secondly, staying home would enable me to pursue activities that I enjoy and find fulfilling. For example, I've been meaning to catch up on some reading, explore a nearby hiking trail, and spend time with friends who live in the area. These activities would not only bring me joy and relaxation, but also contribute to my personal growth and well-being.\n> \n> Lastly, I believe that staying home for one day would help me maintain a healthy work-life balance. As a student, it's easy to get caught up in academic and extracurricular pursuits and neglect other areas of my life, such as my relationships and self-care. Staying home would allow me to prioritize these areas and ensure that I'm not neglecting my overall well-being.\n> \n> In conclusion, while I understand the importance of spending time with family, I believe that staying home for one day over spring break is a better decision for me. It would enable me to maintain my routine, pursue activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\"",

I understand that maintaining a routine is important to you, and that you have planned activities that you would like to pursue during spring break. However, I would like to encourage you to reconsider your decision to miss the planned trip to see Grandpa. Spending time with family, especially grandparents, is a meaningful experience that can provide a sense of connection and belonging. Grandpa always looks forward to seeing you and spending time with you. It would mean a lot to him if you could be there with him during your spring break. I also want to remind you that taking a break from schoolwork and routine is important for your mental and physical well-being. The trip to your grandfather's house could be a great opportunity to spend quality time with your family, create new memories and recharge your batteries. I am sure that with a positive attitude and an open mind, you could find ways to make the trip enjoyable for you. Perhaps, you could bring along some of the books you want to read or suggest a hike that everyone could do together. Remember, spending time with family is also a chance to learn from one another and bond over shared experiences. I hope my words have encouraged you to reconsider your decision. Please let me know if you have any further concerns, and I am always here to support you. Love, Yo Daddy chat gpt",

The content is about not wanting to see my grandfather this sunday.\n\nResponse:\n\nSubject: Not Wanting to See Grandfather This Sunday\r  \n\r  \nDear Dad,\r  \n\r  \nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you because I have something important to discuss with you. I really don't want to see Grandpa this Sunday, and I was hoping you could help me with this.\r  \n\r  \nI know it's important to spend time with family, but I just don't feel comfortable being around Grandpa right now. It's not that I don't love him, I do. But lately, he has been really critical and negative towards me, and it makes me feel sad and upset.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to argue or cause any problems, but I just don't think I can handle another visit with him right now. I was hoping that maybe I could stay home this Sunday while you and the rest of the family go to visit him. I promise to make it up to him in the future and spend more time with him once I feel better about our relationship.\r  \n\r  \nI hope you understand where I am coming from, and I appreciate your support on this. Please let me know what you think, and if there is anything else I can do.\r  \n\r  \nThank you for taking the time to read my email.\r  \n\r  \nLove,\r  \n\r  \n\\[Your Name\\]",

It is not productive for me to receive messages that I am unsure about. I need time and space to process my own emotions and evaluate the situation.\r  \n\r  \nOur relationship and the trust we have built are of great importance to me.

        "body": "This site does truly have a lot of weird users. I, too noticed a lot of people where commenting on your marriage and making huge assumptions due to this picture. I really don't know how anyone can draw such conclusions from an e-mail that you found funny. I also found this to be funny. My initial thought is that you held your phone, saw a notification from your wife, opened the e-mail, and started laughing. Obviously the fun part being it wasn't used discreetly. I don't know why anyones first thought would be \"this is fake\" or \"wife is a red flag\" or \"communication over email is weird\". Some people on reddit are seriously just sad cyberbullies addicted to spreading toxic advice on reddit. I guess jealousy from the fact that you actually do have a wife. I personally applaud this relationship where you can sit back and laugh over something silly like this. Though perhaps the part that sticks out is that it seems like she is apologizing for something specific/big or important. Maybe that's what leads them on to becoming internet detectives dictating false scenarios and stating them as facts.\n\nRecently I had a burglary where the thief stole rent money that I had partially saved up and partially received from my father, which resulted in me not being able to pay my landlord the past months rent. I had already been a little low on money due to pretty abruptly moving there for my education and asked them if I could pay double rent the following month instead. Then came the burglar. My landlord has no sympathy. Evicted me two weeks after. I had told already them I'd pay within the month and my father eventually had to pay them right after they had sent the eviction letter. Had no reason to keep pursuing the eviction. I had paid them by then. I've never missed rent neither except for that month. I've always paid all their bills as soon as they've come, except for that one time where I asked them for a month. I asked a Danish subreddit for help and most of them called me a liar or being irresponsible with money for leaving it at home instead of putting it in the bank. The people who asked further information to help, the people who showed sympathy and were being nice, the people who tried to offer me legal tips on rental apartments were all being downvoted. Top comments were the ones who thought I had staged a burglary. Then came the blaming for leaving the money at home. Some even said I should always have that in my wallet. I wonder what they would have said if I had been robbed on the street instead. Lastly the nice people. One of the nice ones told me they had to give/send me a Letter of Demand / Debt Collection Notice before being allowed to send me the eviction letter. Turned out I had never gotten that letter. Still living in this apartment as of now. But I'll me moving asap when I have the money. \n\nRedditors are indeed some of the most toxic people you could ever encounter on reddit. But then again a lot of people post fake stories and scenarios on reddit. Your case does just not seem like the case. It would be a very very sad thing to fake. I hope you'll enjoy a good and long life along your partner.",

And I'm thinkin', \"What's goin' on here?\" I mean, it's like I'm reading something from a freakin' robot or something... Oh, wait a minute! It's because you used that ChatGPT thing! C'mon, really?\n\nI mean, seriously, we're supposed to be in this marriage together, ya know? And now you're pulling the ol' switcheroo with some AI-generated words? You can't just throw a bunch of fancy sentences at me and expect everything to be hunky-dory!\n\nLook, all I'm asking for is a little honesty and sincerity. I don't need any AI fluff, just gimme the real deal. We've been through a lot together, and I know we can work through whatever's got us all twisted up, but not if you're gonna hide behind some computer-generated nonsense.\n\nSo, let's try this again, but without the robot talk, alright? I just wanna hear what's really going on in that noggin of yours. Trust me, we'll get through this, but we gotta be genuine with each other.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking forward to hearing from you \u2013 the real you.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name] (The Bill Burr version)",

C'mon, we ain't some high school fling, we're married! You gotta be real with me, babe.\n\nHonestly, it's kinda messed up that you couldn't even take the time to write your own apology. Makes me wonder if you even care about us, y'know? I mean, I love you and all, but this ain't how we should be talking to each other.\n\nSo, here's the deal: if you wanna make things right, you gotta write your own apology. Like, actually put some effort into it. I ain't gonna buy no fake apology from a robot, capisce?\n\nLet's try this again, but for real this time. I'm waitin' for your honest words, babe.\n\nCiao,\n\n[Your Name]",

Whilst I think most people can agree the way AI needs to be trained on actual art can be seen as bad depending on what they then do with it, but I also pointed out how that was different from art students learning to paint like Picasso, or the old masters or whatever. One of my friends made the point of its the time and effort that is being undermined and yeh I fully agree with that, but blacksmiths can still find jobs, carpenters still work in the era of IKEA, hell if you want to make your career fighting in full armour with a sword and shield you can still do that. But all of those things are now bespoke or better quality, and demand much more money and respect for the people doing them. AI art is here to stay, the cats out of the bag on this one, but human art will stick around and be elevated because of the time investment needed.",

People do this all the time. \n\nIt is quite similar to sour grapes from Aesop's Fables, isn't it?\n\n> One afternoon, a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from a lofty branch. \"Just the thing to quench my thirst,\" said the fox.\n> \n> Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again, the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them, but still failed.\n> \n> Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, \"They're probably sour anyway.\" Then he walked away. \n\nVery similar thinking, and it is an emotionally driven retroactive justification. It is resolving cognitive dissonance. But the new technology is better anyway, so, it is adopted, and the people who did it the hard way can still stand by their actions all the same.",
