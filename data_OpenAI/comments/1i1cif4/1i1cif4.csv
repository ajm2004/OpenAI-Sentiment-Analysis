m75txac,1i1cif4,"I just got access. Tried it on my phone (had to make sure push notifications are on for Tasks in the ChatGPT app‚Äôs settings section, and made sure that banner notifications for ChatGPT are on in my phone‚Äôs settings app). I can‚Äôt really imagine how useful this would be just for a regular text chat (at least, until agents are released)‚Ä¶¬†

But it is useful for web searches. For example, you can say things like ‚ÄúAt 9am, search for the latest news for the day and give me a summary of the top stories‚Äù; or ‚ÄúI go on my lunch break at 12pm. 10 minutes before I go for lunch, find me a list of open restaurants in my area that serve tacos‚Äù.

You‚Äôll then get a notification like you would from any other app, which you can click on and it‚Äôll show you the results. I can see how this would also be useful to remind you to send an email to a colleague, which it could write out when it‚Äôs time to send it or something like that. Will be interesting to see how people use this and how it evolves.

EDIT: Just as an experiment, I tried to schedule a task while in a temporary chat. When it gives you the reminder and you click on the notification, there will be a brand new chat (not in temporary mode) just with the response to your task request, without the request you wrote itself from the temporary chat.",2025-01-14 21:04:06,Commercial_Nerve_308

m7bjbu6,1i1cif4,"This is the same concern Socrates had about the invention of writing, so I'm not sure if the underlying logic holds up.

Especially when you consider that writing did kind of the opposite. It freed up our working memory to hold more valuable things as we could offput more minor things. And we were able to retain more details of more important things.

Are we worse off for not remembering phone numbers? What does that matter? All of humanity before us didn't memorize phone numbers. It's such an arbitrary thing.

Stuff like this really just depends on how you use it for whether it's good or bad. If you value memorizing your friends names, then memorize their names and don't offload that to writing it down. If you want to help memorize their names, use reminders to practice their names until you remember them. Etc.

m7mrbnv,1i1cif4,"Yeah, that was part of it, but not everything. I think Plato's view isn't *entirely* without merit, but the binary writing/speaking can obviously be deconstructed, and in the end, the underlying logic doesn't hold up, as with many binaries in philosophy. What I would take from Plato's view on writing is that, like the pharmakon, it's difficult to decide whether it's poison or a cure, and maybe it's not just one or the other. Like, Plato was aware that writing helps to spread ideas far and wide, but that's also a problem, as we can clearly see nowadays with disinfo on social media.  
  
I think you're right in a way: Yeah, who needs to remember phone numbers? Like, I don't need to know how a wheel is built or a steam engine, because there's barely any useful application of that skill in modern society. But that quickly becomes a slippery slope. I think another way of framing this is by imagining what insane things billionaires get help with and what happens to them if they had to organize their lives by themselves.
  
I think there's value in asking what kind of skills are not only useful in modern society, but in general. Like, in a hypothetical future where AGI does everything for us and we basically don't need to do anything really ‚Äì would it be a good idea to barely have *any* skills at all?
