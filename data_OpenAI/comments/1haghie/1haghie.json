Lightricks has their open source LTX model and Genmo is pushing Mochi as open source. Black Forest Labs is working on video too.\n\nSora will fall into the same pit that Dall-E did. SaaS doesn't work for artists, and open source always trumps closed source models.\n\nArtists want to fine tune their models, add them to ComfyUI workflows, and use ControlNets to precision control the outputs.\n\nImages are now almost 100% Flux and Stable Diffusion, and video will soon be 100% Hunyuan and LTX.\n\nSora doesn't have much market apart from name recognition at this point. It's just another inflexible closed source model like Runway or Pika. Open source has caught up with state of the art and is pushing past it.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)\n\nYou should see what people are building with Open Source video models like HunYuan \\[1\\] and ComfyUI + Control Nets.

        "body": "I do. I benefit from a significant shift in cost of living. I moved from the east coast in a town that cost of living was rated as 80% above the us average, to the midwest in a town where the cost of living is 30% below the us average. My dollar goes a lot farther than it used to.\n\nSo, individually none of those bills go over 200. Now I could ding my self and say for groceries I make an up front purchase of a 1/2 beef at the beginning of the year. But thats a yearly payment of 600-700 bucks. So like 50-60 a month if you spread it out. 3$ a lb roughly. Throw that sucker in the freezer chest and make steak the rest of the year. Car / Home insurance probably the next two highest on the list. Pay those semi anually. But thats 500/6mo and 1000/6mo so still comes out to less than 200 a month. After that expenses are almost non existen. Electricity is cheap here, lots of wind turbines. like 150 for the month of july if I ran the AC 24/7. (which I do fuck the heat) gas maxes out at like 60 a month. (I don't heat the house above 65 during the winter.) And the non cow related groceries are much cheaper out here. I don't have a mortgage, no car payment, no credit card debt. I live frugally because I want to retire young and enjoy the world before I get to old to do so in the way I want. \n\nOnly real downside of being in the midwest is the tornados. I could really do without having to hide in the basement 3-6 times a year wondering if I'm off to Oz. So ... it has trade offs.",

Also, guess what most folks prefer to do with video generators - They like to animate their own photos, or animate photos of themselves hugging dead loved ones, or just goofy silly things like memes, or animate great images they've already generated rather than roll the dice that the text2video is going to get the scene exactly how you want it....

The model would not use prompts like it currently does for Dall-E because the model itself is generating the image instead of asking another model to generate it. They may add prompt enhancement to the user input before sending to the model, but we don't know.",
