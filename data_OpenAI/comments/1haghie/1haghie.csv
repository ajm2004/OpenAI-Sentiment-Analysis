For those not in this space, Sora is essentially dead on arrival.

Sora performs worse than closed source Kling and Hailuo, but more importantly, it's already trumped by open source too.

Tencent is releasing a fully open source Hunyuan model \[1\] that is better than all of the SOTA closed source models. Lightricks has their open source LTX model and Genmo is pushing Mochi as open source. Black Forest Labs is working on video too.

Sora will fall into the same pit that Dall-E did. SaaS doesn't work for artists, and open source always trumps closed source models.

Artists want to fine tune their models, add them to ComfyUI workflows, and use ControlNets to precision control the outputs.

Images are now almost 100% Flux and Stable Diffusion, and video will soon be 100% Hunyuan and LTX.

Sora doesn't have much market apart from name recognition at this point. It's just another inflexible closed source model like Runway or Pika. Open source has caught up with state of the art and is pushing past it.

\[1\] [https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)

You should see what people are building with Open Source video models like HunYuan \[1\] and ComfyUI + Control Nets. It blows Sora out of the water.

Check out the Banodoco Discord community \[2\]. These are the people pioneering steerable AI video, and it's all being built on top of open source.

So, individually none of those bills go over 200. Now I could ding my self and say for groceries I make an up front purchase of a 1/2 beef at the beginning of the year. But thats a yearly payment of 600-700 bucks. So like 50-60 a month if you spread it out. 3$ a lb roughly. Throw that sucker in the freezer chest and make steak the rest of the year. Car / Home insurance probably the next two highest on the list. Pay those semi anually. But thats 500/6mo and 1000/6mo so still comes out to less than 200 a month. After that expenses are almost non existen. Electricity is cheap here, lots of wind turbines. like 150 for the month of july if I ran the AC 24/7. (which I do fuck the heat) gas maxes out at like 60 a month. (I don't heat the house above 65 during the winter.) And the non cow related groceries are much cheaper out here. I don't have a mortgage, no car payment, no credit card debt. I live frugally because I want to retire young and enjoy the world before I get to old to do so in the way I want. 

Only real downside of being in the midwest is the tornados. I could really do without having to hide in the basement 3-6 times a year wondering if I'm off to Oz. So ... it has trade offs.",2024-12-10 01:31:31,davedcne

No, I'm more annoyed that you can't create consistent characters across multiple videos since it won't let you upload people.

EDIT:

  
What confused me was your ""or will it have better prompts"". The model would not use prompts like it currently does for Dall-E because the model itself is generating the image instead of asking another model to generate it.
