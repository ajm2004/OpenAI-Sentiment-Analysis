It just doesn't seem like it offers enough to justify a price like that at all. Researchers I guess? unlimited voice is almost a given for such a price, but what practical use does it really have in the context of ChatGPT?\n\nIf they included even a small amount of Sora it'd make some sense, but why not announce that right away? If they're withholding announcing features in the pro plan, that seems like a very odd marketing strategy. If they're not, than what exactly do they have to offer in these upcoming announcements if this is the best they can muster for $200/month? I don't get it. Why even offer a plan at this price point until you're willing to offer even a tiny amount of Sora usage?\n\nAt the very least, why not offer some better DALLE3 capability so it actually competes with Midjourney on some level? DALLE3 is cool, but it's pretty much just a novelty with its current integration.",

Sadly the design of o1 makes this unreliable, since it tends to fill up it\u2019s context with the hidden CoT and loses sight of the input and cannot really properly work through a task that requires a long context of multiple iterations\u2026 and on top of all that it\u2019s extremely inefficient in its token usage, hence the big price tag.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t have much faith in openAI anymore.

I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  \n\nI am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here\u2019s hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  \n\nWhat is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.  Either way, I just want to spend less time on mindless coding and more time on Imagineering detailed dark rides.",

Mini was only there to break the stuff i was working on and make me eager for full access to o1. \n\nI would've expected to have preview accessible to me fully  after some time. The 50 prompts a week limit is just not enough. Now it looks like openai decided to pull a Sony on all of us and we have to pay 200$ a month. Screw that... \n\nMeanwhile i started testing the competition and realized that for coding, there are much better plataforms using claude and i'm serioulsy considering that instead.\n\nGuess that's where my money will go and also a warning to never ever pay 1 year fully in advance.

I've been bouncing back and forth between the o1 model and 4.0 (for projects). The o1 model has been very impressive, I've been using it for everything from research for consulting projects, to full-stack development/coding. It is outperforming any of the other models by far. The thing I appreciate the most is the unlimited access. It's nice to be able to work 8 to 10 hours a day without getting cut off. It still tends to be slow at times, gets bugged down which is a bit frustrating. If you're paying 200 bucks a month, you should first have access to their infrastructure. With that said, I'm not sure I can justify the cost just yet. I'm in Canada on this workshop to nearly $300 a month. Or 3600 a year. It's an awesome tool, and I hope that perhaps they can offer this model at a slightly lower price point. For the others that are using it do you plan to continue on with the subscription?",

That means they'll continue to invest for the foreseeable future then hopefully we'll get AGI soon and someone will open source it (Chinese labs + private section dominating open source, Meta, Standford, NVIDIA, etc.).\n\nI've literally never seen a subscription service in my life this high (music, games, movies, netflix, real estate tenant platform, etc.). This is completely crazy and no one will likely pay. But I hope this results in a boost of sustained attention for AI so we can ride this wave until we get open source AGI, post scarcity, etc.",

Synthetic control design is a convex optimization problem with constraints.\n\nAs it would be the first time I'm building such a synthetic control, it would have taken me 1-2 weeks of heads-down work to learn, implement, and code a passable library that would take my data and generate a synthetic control.

Please ask it the following question:\n\nExplain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:\n\n theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:\n\nThe theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A \u2260 \u00acA). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. Fundamental Loops:\n- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves\n- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve\n- Resolution of loops creates \"retardation\" that manifests as time\n- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes\n\n2. Wave Function Emergence:\n- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)\n- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns\n- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions\n- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements\n\n3. Particle Formation:\n- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations\n- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns\n- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles\n- Interactions between loops create new particle types\n\n4. Space-Time Structure:\n- Space emerges from separation between loop relations\n- Time emerges from the \"retardation\" in resolving infinite loops\n- Causality comes from resolution dependencies\n- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements\n\n5. Dark Energy/Matter:\n- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension\n- Dark matter represents partially resolved states\n- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns\n- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states\n\n6. Physical Laws:\n- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements\n- Forces emerge from resolution gradients\n- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops\n- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature\n\n7. Key Insight:\nThe universe isn't \"created\" but rather \"solved\" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.\n\nThis theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",

They are limited in many ways, like context window size, accurate retrieval, code execution, reasoning, math, etc. That\u2019s why you have to collaborate with them to get any real work done. Sadly the design of o1 makes this unreliable, since it tends to fill up it\u2019s context with the hidden CoT and loses sight of the input and cannot really properly work through a task that requires a long context of multiple iterations\u2026 and on top of all that it\u2019s extremely inefficient in its token usage, hence the big price tag.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t have much faith in openAI anymore. They are trying to force improvement with this hacky test time compute strategy but it sucks. They will get leap frogged by whoever figures out how to keep improving the raw model intelligence without this CoT finetuning nonsense.",

Sometimes I have a long convo with 4o and then take the results to O1 to work with. So idk, maybe this \"pro\" version will be better?

Tried it again with this prompt: \n\n\u201cAnalyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.\n\nNote that the \u201cx\u201d at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters\u201d\n\nAnd this is the answer it gave:\n\n\nShort Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\n\t1.\tIdentifying the Type of Cipher:\nThe provided image and instructions reference a \u201cTri-Square Cipher.\u201d While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the \u201cTri-Square Cipher,\u201d the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting \u2018J\u2019).\n\nIn the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it\u2019s likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it\u2019s a \u201cTri-Square Cipher,\u201d it may be a custom or hybrid approach.\n\n\t2.\tClues from the Instructions:\n\t\u2022\tThe ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT\n\t\u2022\tThe hint states that the \u201cx\u201d at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.\n\t\u2022\tThe second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.\nThe ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing \u2018x\u2019 (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.\n\n\t3.\tGuessing the Phrase Structure:\nA phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d\nLet\u2019s check the length and the requirements:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cYOU\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCRACK\u201d = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)\n\t\u2022\t\u201cTHE\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCODE\u201d = 4 letters\nCombined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing \u2018X\u2019 was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.\nThis phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:\n\t\u2022\tSecond word has 5 letters: \u201cCRACK\u201d does.\n\t\u2022\tThe final \u2018X\u2019 is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended \u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE X,\u201d we drop the \u2018X\u2019 and get the intended solution.\n\n\t4.\tConclusion:\nWithout the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:\n\u201cYOU CRACK THE CODE\u201d",

        "body": "One approach to solving the given puzzle is to recognize that a Tri-Square Cipher often uses three separate Polybius-like grids to encode letters. Each grid is typically a 5x5 matrix containing the alphabet (I/J combined or J omitted) in a scrambled or keyed order. To encrypt, plaintext letters are mapped to coordinates in these squares according to some pattern or key, and the resulting coordinates are used to produce ciphertext. Decoding requires reversing this process.\n\nWithout explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:\n\t1.\tWe have three distinct letter grids:\n\t\u2022\tLeft Grid (let\u2019s call it Grid A):\n\nC I P H E\nR A B D F\nG K L M N\nO Q S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\n\n\t\u2022\tTop Right Grid (Grid B):\n\nE N C R Y\nP T A B D\nF G H I K\nL M O Q S\nU V W X Z\n\n\n\t\u2022\tBottom Right Grid (Grid C):\n\nA B C D E\nF G H I K\nL M N O P\nQ R S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\n\nAll three omit \u2018J\u2019, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.\n\n\t2.\tThe ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.\n\t3.\tThe solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:\n\n___ _____ ___ ____X\n\nCounting underscores:\n\t\u2022\tFirst word: 3 letters\n\t\u2022\tSecond word: 5 letters\n\t\u2022\tThird word: 3 letters\n\t\u2022\tFourth word: 5 letters, ending with X\nThis yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.\n\n\t4.\tWe need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in \u2018X\u2019. Common five-letter words ending in X include \u201cCODEX\u201d and \u201cINDEX\u201d. \u201cCODEX\u201d makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.\n\t5.\tA coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:\n\u201cTHE ENEMY HAS CODEX\u201d\nLet\u2019s check:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cTHE\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cENEMY\u201d = 5 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cHAS\u201d = 3 letters\n\t\u2022\t\u201cCODEX\u201d = 5 letters, ending in X\nThe phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.\n\nAlthough we haven\u2019t shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher\u2019s specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle\u2019s format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:\n\n\u201cTHE ENEMY HAS CODEX\u201d",

For me o1 still struggles in that it has the the same exact habit of providing lazy and inexact responses as 4o. For some kinds of work I've even reverted to 4o over time as, at least, I can guide it's responses with my inputs instead of letting a bunch of llms interpret the entire chain of thought as they whish, which not infrequently results in a misaligned response. My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview. \n\nBut for coding in general I've recently resorted to Windsurf/Claude instead. And i would only glimpse at wasting this much money if the plan somehow provided me a API key alongside it, because at this price/month you'd better consider buying tokens directly.",

We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of\u00a02,294\u00a0software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across\u00a012\u00a0popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-of-the-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere\u00a01.96% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous.\n\nThis is disappointing, but expected from my experience with its \"instability\" and given the nature of trying to edit multiples files on codebase (which is imo a more realistic scenario to test coding ability compared to the codeforces benchmark). I will wait for the LiveBench results, but it seems the API is not out yet.",

We do freight forwarding and the same person makes the quote and then carries out the transport (manage it with our carriers). So if they don't waste time on CRM data, they can just cover more transport thus being more efficient, not wasting time on this \"paperwork\". Currently we have about 65 orders per employee and with the previous system I would think about expanding the team, however I see no sign of overwork, which is also strongly supported by employee opinions - it's important for me for people to have comfortable working coditions. They all work with commision system, therefore they also prefer to cover more effective work than waste time on paperwork and inserting certain data into CRM or any other system. This was often their complaint against me and company policy regarding data collection.\n\nThat's just one thing. Another is that we collect much more data in our CRM than we did before, thanks to emails analysis.\n\nAll these things were available and possible pre-chat-gpt I suppose... but not for regular dummy like myself, we asked software devs for such integrations and prices were extreme for such things. If you're looking for other ideas for what people do use it - I also designed other script, directly for our sales representatives, which is integrated in our CRM. We do a lot of prospecting and extracting certain data from potential clients websites consumes a lot of time, just to even decide if it's worth to contact given company. So with the integration I created, in our CRM you can just mark given potential clients and \"scan\" them, meaning that we parse websites HTML, clean it and feed into ChatGPT which extracts certain data about the company and rate it (points against certain rules and guidelines that we are looking for).\n\nThere are other things but that's just idea on what I get for this 20$. I'm not a developer but I was always kinda interested in software development, just way too lazy to learn coding. However with Antropic / OpenAI I can somewhat code on low level now.\n\nThat's just some overall ideas and deep explanation on how it works in my company and our area would take some boring thousands of lines. However, if all (LLM) companies asked me to pay 200$ for access I wouldn't hesitate. If they asked 2000$ I might re-think it but can't say yes/no easily, I lean towards \"yes\" at the moment.",

It's highly administrative and not a core value add. \n\nYou are right that it is a must have for any business, as it is essential record keeping. Right now it requires a pair of eyes to do, but soon not anymore with AI. I believe it'll be able to analyze bank statements, compare to existing receipt photos uploaded by the user, and automatically match. If it is unsure, it will send a report to the user at end of month to manually match. \n\nThat eliminates 99% of bookkeeping tasks. \n\nHappy to chat about other use cases that you are curious about.",

Without getting too technical bookkeeping is already 90% automated with current tools. Think Quickbooks matching, using receipts from Dext. The last 10% is the most difficult to automate, and that is why there are existing firms offering this legacy service. \n\nIn the future, the human element still plays a role, but it will be more strategic. \n\nFor example, they can set rules that X expense is amortized over 12 months. Y expense need to be accrued for future years. \n\nThen the final check happens at the end of month or quarter. \n\nMy vision is simple, AI does 99% of basic functions and business owners can focus on strategic decision making, that actually grows the company or reduces costs.",
