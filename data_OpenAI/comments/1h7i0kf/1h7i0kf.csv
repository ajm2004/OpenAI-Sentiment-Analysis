m0ls481,1h7i0kf,"I don't understand what they're trying to do here. I get this isn't for regular consumers, but who exactly is it for? It just doesn't seem like it offers enough to justify a price like that at all. Researchers I guess? unlimited voice is almost a given for such a price, but what practical use does it really have in the context of ChatGPT?

If they included even a small amount of Sora it'd make some sense, but why not announce that right away? If they're withholding announcing features in the pro plan, that seems like a very odd marketing strategy. If they're not, than what exactly do they have to offer in these upcoming announcements if this is the best they can muster for $200/month? I don't get it. Why even offer a plan at this price point until you're willing to offer even a tiny amount of Sora usage?

At the very least, why not offer some better DALLE3 capability so it actually competes with Midjourney on some level? DALLE3 is cool, but it's pretty much just a novelty with its current integration.",2024-12-05 21:29:59,Reggaejunkiedrew

I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  

I am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here‚Äôs hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  

What is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.

The o1 model has been very impressive, I've been using it for everything from research for consulting projects, to full-stack development/coding. It is outperforming any of the other models by far. The thing I appreciate the most is the unlimited access. It's nice to be able to work 8 to 10 hours a day without getting cut off. It still tends to be slow at times, gets bugged down which is a bit frustrating. If you're paying 200 bucks a month, you should first have access to their infrastructure. With that said, I'm not sure I can justify the cost just yet. I'm in Canada on this workshop to nearly $300 a month. Or 3600 a year.

m0lf2qh,1h7i0kf,"I have been working on this theory for a long time. Please ask it the following question:

Explain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:

 theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:

The theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A ‚â† ¬¨A). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:

1. Fundamental Loops:
- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves
- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve
- Resolution of loops creates ""retardation"" that manifests as time
- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes

2. Wave Function Emergence:
- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)
- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns
- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions
- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements

3. Particle Formation:
- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations
- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns
- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles
- Interactions between loops create new particle types

4. Space-Time Structure:
- Space emerges from separation between loop relations
- Time emerges from the ""retardation"" in resolving infinite loops
- Causality comes from resolution dependencies
- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements

5. Dark Energy/Matter:
- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension
- Dark matter represents partially resolved states
- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns
- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states

6. Physical Laws:
- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements
- Forces emerge from resolution gradients
- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops
- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature

7. Key Insight:
The universe isn't ""created"" but rather ""solved"" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.

This theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",2024-12-05 20:22:17,GalacticGlampGuide

Detailed Reasoning:

From the image provided, you have a Tri-Square Cipher with the ciphertext XUCLNQKT. Below it, there‚Äôs a hint at the plaintext format:
‚Äú___ _____ ___ ____X‚Äù
Counting the underscores:
	‚Ä¢	First word: 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	Second word: 5 letters
	‚Ä¢	Third word: 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with an X.

This pattern corresponds to a four-word phrase:
	‚Ä¢	3 letters, 5 letters, 3 letters, 5 letters (and the last word ends with ‚ÄòX‚Äô).

A phrase that makes sense in the context of cracking ciphers and includes a final word ending in ‚ÄòX‚Äô is ‚ÄúYOU CRACK THE CODEX‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYOU‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù = 5 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTHE‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCODEX‚Äù = 5 letters and ends with X

‚ÄúYOU CRACK THE CODEX‚Äù fits perfectly into the pattern ‚Äú___ _____ ___ ____X‚Äù and is a thematically appropriate phrase for a puzzle involving a cipher. Thus, the likely plaintext is:

YOU CRACK THE CODEX",2024-12-05 20:52:45,mxforest
m0lj66q,1h7i0kf,I tried o1 (not pro) and it says YOU BREAK THE CODEX,2024-12-05 20:43:51,9zer
m0m1w5f,1h7i0kf,"Ok so I tried to do this a few times. It thought the X was included and it miscounted the spaces in the second word the first time. Tried it again with this prompt: 

‚ÄúAnalyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.

Note that the ‚Äúx‚Äù at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters‚Äù

And this is the answer it gave:


Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:
‚ÄúYOU CRACK THE CODE‚Äù

Detailed Reasoning:
	1.	Identifying the Type of Cipher:
The provided image and instructions reference a ‚ÄúTri-Square Cipher.‚Äù While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the ‚ÄúTri-Square Cipher,‚Äù the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting ‚ÄòJ‚Äô).

In the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it‚Äôs likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúTri-Square Cipher,‚Äù it may be a custom or hybrid approach.

	2.	Clues from the Instructions:
	‚Ä¢	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT
	‚Ä¢	The hint states that the ‚Äúx‚Äù at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.
	‚Ä¢	The second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.
The ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing ‚Äòx‚Äô (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.

	3.	Guessing the Phrase Structure:
A phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:
‚ÄúYOU CRACK THE CODE‚Äù
Let‚Äôs check the length and the requirements:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYOU‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTHE‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCODE‚Äù = 4 letters
Combined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing ‚ÄòX‚Äô was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.
This phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:
	‚Ä¢	Second word has 5 letters: ‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù does.
	‚Ä¢	The final ‚ÄòX‚Äô is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended ‚ÄúYOU CRACK THE CODE X,‚Äù we drop the ‚ÄòX‚Äô and get the intended solution.

	4.	Conclusion:
Without the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:

m0m1jxh,1h7i0kf,"One approach to solving the given puzzle is to recognize that a Tri-Square Cipher often uses three separate Polybius-like grids to encode letters. Each grid is typically a 5x5 matrix containing the alphabet (I/J combined or J omitted) in a scrambled or keyed order. To encrypt, plaintext letters are mapped to coordinates in these squares according to some pattern or key, and the resulting coordinates are used to produce ciphertext. Decoding requires reversing this process.

Without explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:
	1.	We have three distinct letter grids:
	‚Ä¢	Left Grid (let‚Äôs call it Grid A):

C I P H E
R A B D F
G K L M N
O Q S T U
V W X Y Z


	‚Ä¢	Top Right Grid (Grid B):

E N C R Y
P T A B D
F G H I K
L M O Q S
U V W X Z


	‚Ä¢	Bottom Right Grid (Grid C):

A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z


All three omit ‚ÄòJ‚Äô, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.

	2.	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.
	3.	The solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:

___ _____ ___ ____X

Counting underscores:
	‚Ä¢	First word: 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	Second word: 5 letters
	‚Ä¢	Third word: 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with X
This yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.

	4.	We need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in ‚ÄòX‚Äô. Common five-letter words ending in X include ‚ÄúCODEX‚Äù and ‚ÄúINDEX‚Äù. ‚ÄúCODEX‚Äù makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.
	5.	A coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:
‚ÄúTHE ENEMY HAS CODEX‚Äù
Let‚Äôs check:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTHE‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúENEMY‚Äù = 5 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHAS‚Äù = 3 letters
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCODEX‚Äù = 5 letters, ending in X
The phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.

Although we haven‚Äôt shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher‚Äôs specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle‚Äôs format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:

m0m6ike,1h7i0kf,"I didn‚Äôt explain it clearly, but the issue is that to generate the response it creates a huge CoT which fills the context between the input and the final output. This makes it ‚Äúunstable‚Äù (not sure how to better describe it) which means that it sometimes changes a lot of the content from the input on the output (low score on code completion benchmarks) and when you continue the chat it does not keep a stable chat context of how it arrived to the previous answer which means it could bear off into a complete new train of thought. 

This makes it incompatible with the current method of working alongside an LLM by iterating over and over a series of scripts, for example, to create a codebase for a project.

These models seem to work much better when you can just one shot a problem without iterating, without needing to build on previous work or needing a long context. 

That‚Äôs the downside of this approach of fine tuning on long CoTs. I personally do not really like how these models work and I wish someone finds a more elegant way to keep scaling their intelligence.",2024-12-05 22:46:41,bot_exe

m0ml3b9,1h7i0kf,"Lmao what kind of work are you conducting in which o1 saves ""hundreds of hours a week""? And it's one that justifies 200/month? For me o1 still struggles in that it has the the same exact habit of providing lazy and inexact responses as 4o. For some kinds of work I've even reverted to 4o over time as, at least, I can guide it's responses with my inputs instead of letting a bunch of llms interpret the entire chain of thought as they whish, which not infrequently results in a misaligned response. My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview. 

But for coding in general I've recently resorted to Windsurf/Claude instead. And i would only glimpse at wasting this much money if the plan somehow provided me a API key alongside it, because at this price/month you'd better consider buying tokens directly.",2024-12-06 00:12:29,the_koom_machine

It‚Äôs nice that we can get better performance by training bigger models and throwing more hardware at them. Those gains are logarithmically decreasing at the rate at which we can feed more machine to them.

Listen to the field experts who are projecting a theoretical maximum performance from extrapolating the gains. It‚Äôs not ASI, it‚Äôs hoping we can get to it by leap frogging to another solution we don‚Äôt have yet.

I can look at 3, 3.5, o, 4, all of the open source models, and I can see the direct comparison between niche focused trained LLM models and their niche and the larger parameterization in the general models and the (super cool) integration support they are adding to the productized versions of these models.

For context, description of SWE bench:

>Language models have outpaced our ability to evaluate them effectively, but for their future development it is essential to study the frontier of their capabilities. We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of¬†2,294¬†software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across¬†12¬†popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-of-the-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere¬†1.96% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous.

This is disappointing, but expected from my experience with its ""instability"" and given the nature of trying to edit multiples files on codebase (which is imo a more realistic scenario to test coding ability compared to the codeforces benchmark).

They can spend their time in more productive ways than inserting certain data in our CRM, which basically translates into being more productive, which benefits both company and them. We do freight forwarding and the same person makes the quote and then carries out the transport (manage it with our carriers). So if they don't waste time on CRM data, they can just cover more transport thus being more efficient, not wasting time on this ""paperwork"". Currently we have about 65 orders per employee and with the previous system I would think about expanding the team, however I see no sign of overwork, which is also strongly supported by employee opinions - it's important for me for people to have comfortable working coditions. They all work with commision system, therefore they also prefer to cover more effective work than waste time on paperwork and inserting certain data into CRM or any other system. This was often their complaint against me and company policy regarding data collection.

That's just one thing. Another is that we collect much more data in our CRM than we did before, thanks to emails analysis.

All these things were available and possible pre-chat-gpt I suppose... but not for regular dummy like myself, we asked software devs for such integrations and prices were extreme for such things. If you're looking for other ideas for what people do use it - I also designed other script, directly for our sales representatives, which is integrated in our CRM. We do a lot of prospecting and extracting certain data from potential clients websites consumes a lot of time, just to even decide if it's worth to contact given company. So with the integration I created, in our CRM you can just mark given potential clients and ""scan"" them, meaning that we parse websites HTML, clean it and feed into ChatGPT which extracts certain data about the company and rate it (points against certain rules and guidelines that we are looking for).

There are other things but that's just idea on what I get for this 20$. I'm not a developer but I was always kinda interested in software development, just way too lazy to learn coding. However with Antropic / OpenAI I can somewhat code on low level now.

That's just some overall ideas and deep explanation on how it works in my company and our area would take some boring thousands of lines. However, if all (LLM) companies asked me to pay 200$ for access I wouldn't hesitate. If they asked 2000$ I might re-think it but can't say yes/no easily, I lean towards ""yes"" at the moment.",2024-12-09 18:14:13,Trick_Text_6658

m0onysu,1h7i0kf,"$23/hr income is about $3700/month, even in the US, $23/hr is higher than the median income, so more than half of all Americans earn less than that, so it‚Äôs not at all being poor ([the median 2022 was $3250/month](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-and-mean-income-after-tax-lis)). If you have to pay $3700/month just for rent and food and other necessities, an extra $20/month could actually be impossible and not insignificant.

m0ltebo,1h7i0kf,"Sounds like you have never done bookkeeping.

At the core of it is matching bank statements to actual receipts. It's highly administrative and not a core value add. 

You are right that it is a must have for any business, as it is essential record keeping. Right now it requires a pair of eyes to do, but soon not anymore with AI. I believe it'll be able to analyze bank statements, compare to existing receipt photos uploaded by the user, and automatically match. If it is unsure, it will send a report to the user at end of month to manually match. 

That eliminates 99% of bookkeeping tasks. 

Happy to chat about other use cases that you are curious about.",2024-12-05 21:36:41,CanadianCFO

m0lyr93,1h7i0kf,"Technology rarely feels like a light switch. It's more of a gradual brightening of possibilities. Without getting too technical bookkeeping is already 90% automated with current tools. Think Quickbooks matching, using receipts from Dext. The last 10% is the most difficult to automate, and that is why there are existing firms offering this legacy service. 

In the future, the human element still plays a role, but it will be more strategic. 

For example, they can set rules that X expense is amortized over 12 months. Y expense need to be accrued for future years. 

Then the final check happens at the end of month or quarter. 

My vision is simple, AI does 99% of basic functions and business owners can focus on strategic decision making, that actually grows the company or reduces costs.",2024-12-05 22:04:37,CanadianCFO
