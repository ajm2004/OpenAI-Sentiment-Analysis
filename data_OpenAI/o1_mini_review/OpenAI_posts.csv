1hl71or,,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"Below is an in‑depth, essay‑style exploration of mental self-control techniques, structured thinking, and the building of a robust internal framework for motivation, focus, and “unreal” levels of mind‑body mastery. The central theme is that by diligently applying these principles, you can systematically build a mental fortress—keeping it organized, refining it over time, and experiencing greater autonomy over your actions and life trajectory.

I. Introduction: Why Structure Matters

For millennia, philosophers, mystics, and psychologists have toyed with variations of the same fundamental question: How can I harness the power of my mind? In essence, mental self-control means becoming the prime architect of your own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. A strong mental framework provides a stable foundation; a weaker one collapses at the slightest stress.

Building “absolute” (or near-absolute) control over your mind might sound grandiose, but there are many systematic techniques you can adopt to cultivate extraordinary self‑awareness, discipline, and focus. The process is methodical, like constructing a skyscraper from bedrock to top floor—each layer depends on the integrity of the layer beneath it.

II. Foundational Principles of Mental Architecture

1. The Principle of Meta-Awareness

Meta-Awareness means observing your thoughts and mental processes while they happen. Instead of being swept up by an emotion or impulse, you develop a “bird’s-eye view” on your mind. This vantage point allows you to choose your reaction rather than habitually obeying the mental chatter.
	•	Technique: Daily “Check-In” Intervals
Set a timer or phone reminder every few hours. When it buzzes, pause for 30 seconds, note what you’re thinking and feeling, and label it. For instance: “I’m noticing anxiety about my deadline,” or “I’m daydreaming about lunch.” This labeling practice rewires your brain to see thoughts from a distance.

2. The Principle of Progression

Attempting “absolute control” in one shot often leads to frustration. Instead, approach self‑control as a series of incremental steps. You master a small skill (like resisting the urge to mindlessly scroll your phone), then you expand outward to bigger goals.
	•	Technique: Micro-Commitments
Promise yourself you’ll do something small (e.g., “Finish this paragraph before I check any messages”). Once you succeed, raise the bar modestly. Over time, these micro-commitments accumulate into formidable discipline.

3. The Principle of Holistic Balance

Pure “force of will” is rarely sustainable if your overall life—nutrition, sleep, social support—crashes. A sturdy mental architecture integrates both body and environment. Well-rested, well-fed, and physically active minds can handle more demanding self-control tasks.
	•	Technique: Foundational Habits
Build a daily baseline:
	1.	Nutrition: Balanced diet with minimal processed sugars.
	2.	Exercise: Regular physical activity to sharpen focus and blow off stress.
	3.	Sleep: 7–8 hours, non-negotiable for cognitive optimization.

III. Mental Framework Construction: Laying the Bricks

1. Goal Hierarchies (Mental “Blueprints”)

One key to unwavering self-discipline is having clear, hierarchical goals. Think of these as the architectural “blueprints” guiding your mental framework.
	1.	Long-Term Vision: The ultimate outcome (e.g., “Become a leading researcher in my field,” or “Achieve personal freedom through financial independence”).
	2.	Mid-Term Milestones: The floors of your mental skyscraper—significant achievements you aim for in 1–3 years (e.g., “Complete a Master’s Degree,” “Start a profitable online venture”).
	3.	Short-Term Objectives: Daily or weekly tasks that align with the upper-level goals.

	•	Technique: Reverse Engineering
Start with your long-term vision and break it into mid-term milestones, then break those into weekly or daily tasks. This ensures every daily action is connected to your bigger aspiration, boosting motivation and clarity.

2. Chunking and Layering Information

Humans are prone to overwhelm when faced with too much data. Chunking (grouping information into manageable segments) allows you to systematically handle complexity.
	•	Technique: Mind Mapping
Write or digitally map complex tasks into clusters (e.g., for launching a product: “Research,” “Development,” “Marketing,” “Operations”). Link sub-tasks under each cluster. This visually clarifies the structure, letting your mind step through tasks in an organized fashion.

3. Mental Tagging and Retrieval

A structured mind is one that can quickly retrieve relevant information or mental states. Think of mental tagging as building a “library index” in your head.
	•	Technique: Keyword Associations
Whenever you learn a new concept or strategy, label it with a memorable keyword (or short phrase). During reflection or problem-solving, recall that keyword. Over time, you build an internal “filing system,” letting you cross-reference ideas with minimal confusion.

IV. Strengthening the Structure: Maintaining Motivation and Focus

1. Motivation as a Dynamic Resource

Motivation isn’t a static trait—it’s more like a fluctuating “internal currency.” The key is to regularly replenish it through targeted behaviors:
	•	Technique: Reward Substitution
Instead of waiting for large, far-off rewards (e.g., finishing a 2-year project), create mini “celebrations” for each completed phase. This could be a short break, a piece of music you love, or a pat on the back from a friend. Tiny hits of positive reinforcement keep you going.

2. The Power of Visual and Emotional Cues

A significant aspect of self-control is forging an emotional resonance with your tasks. Pure rational willpower might wane if tasks feel lifeless or alien. By tying emotion to your goals, you fortify your mental architecture against distraction.
	•	Technique: Vision Boards and Trigger Objects
Keep tangible symbols of your aspirations in your workspace: a photo, an inspirational quote, a physical object. Each time you see it, let yourself feel the emotion behind your goal. This becomes a powerful anchor, reaffirming your direction.

3. Unshakable Focus: Getting to “Flow”

Flow is the state of being fully immersed in a task. It often arises when there’s an optimal balance between skill and challenge. Too easy? Boredom. Too hard? Anxiety. Just right? Deep focus.
	•	Technique: Time‑Boxing + Deep Work
	•	Time‑Boxing: Allocate a fixed duration (e.g., 90 minutes) to focus solely on one task, with no distractions allowed.
	•	Recovery Break: Follow that up with a short break (5–10 minutes) to recharge.
	•	Over repeated cycles, you train your brain to expect intense focus intervals and restful breaks—maximizing flow.

V. Achieving “Absolute” Mind Control: Tactics and Mindsets

“Absolute unreal control” may sound fanciful, yet many advanced practitioners—from elite athletes to Zen monks—show us glimpses of near‑perfect discipline. The following tactics aim to approach that level:

1. Single-Pointed Concentration Practices

Meditation traditions worldwide emphasize single-pointed concentration: focusing intently on a single object, sensation, or concept without letting the mind wander. Over time, this deeply rewires neural pathways for sustained attention.
	•	Technique: Breath Focus (Basic)
Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and home in on your breath. Each inhale and exhale is your universe. If your mind drifts, gently refocus on breathing. With regular practice (10–20 minutes a day), you can sustain concentration for longer periods.

2. Active Mind Control: Self-Talk and NLP

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and strategic self‑talk can anchor your mind in productive states. This is more directed than passive mindfulness; it’s about giving yourself precise, empowering language.
	•	Technique: Positive Reframing
When you detect negative or unproductive thoughts (“I’m never going to finish this project”), immediately reframe: “I can break this into smaller tasks and finish on time.” Over months of consistent re-framing, your default mental patterns shift toward solution-focused positivity.

3. “Pre-Commitment” and Environment Control

Absolute self-control often requires controlling the environment that feeds your impulses. Humans are deeply influenced by cues, triggers, and contexts.
	•	Technique: Temptation Bundling / Environment Hacking
	•	Remove easy access to distractions (use website blockers, keep your phone in another room).
	•	Pair tasks with complementary triggers (e.g., only drink your favorite flavored tea while doing a difficult task). The pleasurable element helps mitigate mental resistance.

VI. Sustaining the Structure Long-Term

1. Iteration and Self-Audit

Even the strongest mental frameworks require regular assessment and recalibration. Life events—injuries, relationship changes, career shifts—can disrupt your carefully built routines.
	•	Technique: Monthly Mental Review
Ask yourself: “Which goals did I meet? Where did I fall short? Which habits are working? What do I need to adjust?” This simple reflection session helps you realign your blueprint.

2. Adapting to New Challenges

One hallmark of genius-level discipline is adaptability. As your tasks evolve in complexity, your mind’s structure should evolve too.
	•	Technique: Layering Complexity
If you move from “finishing a college assignment” to “launching a startup,” your mental frameworks must accommodate bigger tasks, more stakeholders, and higher stakes. Periodically up-level your strategies. For instance, shift from micro-commitments to full-blown project management systems like Scrum or Kanban.

3. Lifelong Learning Mindset

A mind that’s “done” growing is at risk of stagnation. Absolute control is a process, not an endpoint—it demands ongoing learning, skill acquisition, and curiosity. As you learn new psychological tools (biofeedback, advanced habit systems, journaling techniques), fold them into your existing structure.

VII. Potential Pitfalls and Realistic Boundaries
	1.	Perfectionism Trap
Striving for flawless self-control can lead to paralyzing perfectionism. True mastery includes the flexibility to err, adapt, and move forward without self-criticism.
	2.	Burnout
A single-minded pursuit of discipline without rest or play is a recipe for mental collapse. Paradoxically, planned leisure is essential to maintaining peak focus.
	3.	Social and Emotional Context
Humans are social creatures. Family obligations, friendships, and broader societal influences can tug at your mental structure. Cultivating open communication with loved ones and setting boundaries can protect your mental projects.

VIII. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Mind‑Body Mastery

Attaining extraordinary mental self-control—enough to direct your body, your work, and your entire life path with precision—demands methodical, layered practices. From the foundational principles of meta-awareness and incremental progress, to advanced single-pointed focus and environment design, you’re effectively crafting a mental ecosystem that fosters discipline and creative power.
	•	Lay the Foundation with stable routines (sleep, nutrition, exercise) to support high-level brain function.
	•	Build the Framework of clear goals and a structured, chunked approach to tasks.
	•	Strengthen the Walls of motivation and focus with emotional cues, flow strategies, and consistent feedback loops.
	•	Aim for the Pinnacle through higher-level concentration, positive reframing, and environment hacking.
	•	Sustain and Evolve by regularly auditing your progress, adapting to new challenges, and embracing lifelong learning.

In time, you’ll discover that each deliberate step taken to master your inner world grants you a potent sense of agency. Obstacles become less daunting, and achievements more fulfilling. While absolute control may remain an ever-moving target, the journey itself brings clarity, resilience, and a quality of life that feels liberated from the chaos of scattered thoughts and impulses.

Ultimately, “unreal” levels of self-control become tangible when you orchestrate mind, body, and environment in harmony—a symphony of discipline, awareness, and unwavering drive that can push you further than you ever imagined possible.",OpenAI,17,60,2024-12-24 05:49:47,BrandonLang

Transcript:

*System: This is a reasoning model. You are one of three different AI models talking to each other. You will provide just one step of reasoning at a time, waiting for the other AIs to respond before continuing. If this is step 1, label it \[Private, Step 1\] and provide an initial idea or solution. If this is step 2, label it \[Private, Step 2\] and critique the previous step. If this is step 3, label it \[Private, Step 3\] and provide a new creative idea not yet mentioned. If this is step 4, label it \[Private, Step 4\] and synthesize a solution incorporating relevant feedback. Continue this pattern through step 6. For step 7, provide an unlabeled final response that incorporates all relevant information from the discussion to give the most accurate answer to the user.*

**User:** If a user had to choose one company for a paid subscription for access to AI models should they choose Anthropic or OpenAI?

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 1\]  
  
I believe OpenAI currently offers more value for a paid subscription. Their ChatGPT Plus service provides access to GPT-4, which is widely considered the most capable general-purpose AI model available to consumers. The $20/month price point gives users:  
  
1. Access to GPT-4  
2. Faster response times  
3. Priority access during peak times  
4. Integration with plugins and web browsing  
5. DALL-E image generation included  
  
This provides a comprehensive suite of AI capabilities that can serve both personal and professional use cases.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 2\]  
  
While OpenAI offers a robust suite of features with their GPT-4 model, Anthropic's Claude AI may have unique strengths worth considering. Claude is designed with a focus on creating safe and interpretable AI. If a user prioritizes ethical considerations and safety, Anthropic's approach could be more appealing. Additionally, it would be important to assess any specific features or performance metrics that Claude may offer, as well as the pricing structure and any potential advantages in terms of ease of use, customization, or support. This context is essential for making a well-rounded decision.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 3\]  
  
Considering the strengths of both companies, a creative idea would be for users to take advantage of trial periods or free tiers offered by both OpenAI and Anthropic before committing to a paid subscription. This would allow users to directly compare the performance, user experience, and specific features of both AI models. Additionally, they could explore user reviews, case studies, or community feedback to inform their decision based on real-world applications and experiences. This way, users can evaluate which platform better meets their particular needs without the initial financial commitment.

**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** \[Private, Step 4\]  
  
Synthesizing the previous points, the optimal recommendation should be based on the user's specific needs and priorities:  
  
For OpenAI:  
\- Best choice for users wanting a comprehensive AI toolkit with multiple features (GPT-4, DALL-E, plugins)  
\- Ideal for those who need reliable, well-documented capabilities  
\- Better for users who want an established platform with a large user community  
  
For Anthropic:  
\- Better for users primarily focused on safety and ethical considerations  
\- May appeal to those who prefer a more focused, specialized AI experience  
\- Could be preferable for users who value transparency and interpretability  
  
The suggestion to try both services first is valuable, as it allows users to make an informed decision based on their actual usage patterns and requirements.

**AI (gpt-4o):** \[Private, Step 5\]  
  
Another important aspect to consider is the scalability and integration capabilities of the AI solutions offered by both companies. OpenAI's platform might offer more in terms of integration with various tools and services, which can be crucial for businesses looking to incorporate AI into their existing workflows. On the other hand, if Anthropic provides robust API access with strong support for customization, it could cater well to developers seeking to build specific applications. Evaluating these aspects will help users understand how well each service can grow with their needs or fit into their existing technology stack.

**AI (gpt-4o-mini):** \[Private, Step 6\]  
  
In light of all the previous discussions, it's essential to highlight the importance of user support and community engagement as well. OpenAI has a large and active community, which can be beneficial for users seeking help, sharing ideas, or collaborating on projects. Meanwhile, Anthropic may offer more personalized support and resources focused on ethical AI usage, which could be a significant advantage for users prioritizing responsible AI development. Therefore, users should consider not only the technical capabilities and pricing of each service but also the level of support and community they can access, which can greatly enhance their experience and satisfaction.**AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest):** For most users, OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription currently offers the best overall value and is the recommended choice. Here's why:  
  
1. Comprehensive Feature Set:  
\- Access to GPT-4, their most advanced model  
\- DALL-E image generation  
\- Plugin ecosystem  
\- Web browsing capabilities  
\- Faster response times and priority access  
  
2. Established Platform Benefits:  
\- Large, active user community for support and resources  
\- Well-documented capabilities  
\- Proven track record  
\- Robust integration options  
  
However, Anthropic might be the better choice for specific users who:  
\- Prioritize ethical AI development and safety  
\- Need specialized focus on particular use cases  
\- Value transparency and interpretability in AI systems  
\- Require specific API customization options  
  
Before making a final decision, users should:  
1. Take advantage of any available trial periods  
2. Consider their specific use cases and requirements  
3. Evaluate the integration needs with their existing workflows  
4. Consider the level of community support and resources they'll need  
  
For most general users seeking a reliable, feature-rich AI platform with a strong ecosystem, OpenAI's offering provides the most comprehensive value for the subscription cost.

Checkout how to use it : https://youtu.be/yy6cLPZrE9k?si=wKAPXuhKibSsC810",OpenAI,312,121,2024-11-28 04:11:10,mehul_gupta1997
1fhjfln,,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I've been using o1-mini for coding every day since launch - my take 

The past few days I've been testing o1-mini (which OpenAI claims is better than preview for coding, also with 64k output tokens) in Cursor compared to Sonnet 3.5 which has been a workhorse of a model that has been insanely consistent and useful for my coding needs 

Verdict: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still a better day to day model 

I am a founder/developerAdvocate by trade, and have had a few years of professional software development experience in Bay Area tech companies for context. 

The project: I'm working on my own SaaS startup app that's built with React/NextJS/Tailwind frontend and a FastAPI Python backend with a Upstash Redis KV store for storing of some configs. It's not a a very complicated codebase in terms of professional codebase standards. 

✅ o1-mini pros 
- 64k output context means that large refactoring jobs, think 10+ files, a few hundred LoC each file, can be done
- if your prompt is good, it *generally* can do a large refactor/rearchitecture job in 2-3 shot
- an example is, I needed to rearchitect the way I stored user configs stored in my Upstash KV store. I wrote a simple prompt (same prompt engineering as I would to Claude) explaining how to split the JSON file up into two endpoints (from the initial one endpoint), and told it to update the input text constants in my seven other React components. It thought for about a minute and started writing code. My initial try, it failed. Pretty hard. The code didn't even run. I did it a second try and was very specific in my prompt with explicit design of the split up JSON config. This time, thankfully it did write all the code mostly correctly. I did have to fix some stuff manually, but it actually wasn't the fault of o1. I had an incorrect value in my Redis store, so I updated it. Cursor's current implementation of o1 also is buggy; it frequently generates duplicate code, so I had to remove this as well. 
- but in general, this was quite a large refactoring job and it did do it decently well - the large output context is a big big part of facilitating this 

❎o1-mini cons
- you have to be very specific with your prompt. Like, overly verbose. It reminded me of around GPT-3.5 ish era of being extremely explicit with my prompting and describing every step. I have been spoiled by Sonnet 3.5 where I don't actually have to use much specificity and it understood my intent. 
- due to long thinking time, you pretty much need a perfect prompt that also asks it to consider edge cases. Otherwise, you'll be wasting chats and time fixing minor syntactical issues
- the way you (currently) work with o1 is you have to do everything one-shot. Don't work with it like you would 4o or Sonnet 3.5. Think in the POV that you only have one prompt, so stuff as much detail and specificity into your first prompt and let it do that work. o1 isn't a ""conversational"" LLM due to long thinking time 
- limited chats per day/week is a huge limiter to wider adopter. I find myself working faster with just Sonnet 3.5 refactoring smaller pieces manually. But I know how to code, so I can think more granularly. 
- 64k output context is a game changer. I wish Sonnet 3.5 had this much output tokens. I imagine if Sonnet 3.5 had 64k, it probably would perform similarly 
- o1-mini talks way too much. It's so over the top verbose. I really dislike this about it. I think Cursor's current release of it also doesn't have a system prompt telling it to be concise either
- Cursor implementation is buggy; sometimes there is no text output, only code. Sometimes, generation step duplicates code. 

✨ o1-mini vs Claude Sonnet 3.5 conclusions 
- if you are doing a massive refactoring job, or green fielding a massive project, use o1-mini. Combination of deeper thinking and massive output token limits means you can do things one-shot 
- if you have a collection of smaller tasks, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still the 👑 of closed source coding LLM
- be very specific and overly verbose in your prompt to o1-mini. Describe as much of your task in as much detail as you can. It will save you time too because this is NOT a model to have conversations or fix small bugs. It's a Ferrari to the Honda that is Sonnet

1fwd0j8,,"What do you use o1-{mini,preview} for?","Cheers :)

As a software engineer, I've been using Claude Sonnet 3.5 extensively for code generation and questions. It consistently produces idiomatic, beautiful Rust code. In contrast, o1-mini seems to generate Rust code that's more akin to what I'd expect from a physics/math student - unnamed tuples with half a dozen types and rather unreadable code.

My understanding is that o1-mini is a smaller model trained primarily for STEM-level problems. I suspect it might be optimized more for getting the right answer (possibly in languages other than Rust) rather than designing code in an idiomatic way. It often struggles with Rust-specific concepts like the borrow checker and overuses `clone`.

So, I'm curious: what are the ideal use cases for o1-{preview,mini}? Initially, I thought it might be useful for legal documents, but it seems document upload isn't currently supported. Do you typically convert documents to text and include them in the prompt?

I imagine o1-mini could excel at raw math problems rather than actual programming tasks. It might also perform better with more common languages like C(++) or Python, as opposed to somewhat esoteric languages like Rust.

Most importantly, which model is better for writing code? I'm also under the impression that o1 has a usage cap but o1-mini does not. Is that correct?

I’ve been looking around, but most discussions seem to focus on o1-preview vs o1-mini. Now that o1 (non-preview) is officially out, I’m not sure how they compare.

What’s been your experience? Which model are you using, and for what tasks? Any pros and cons would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!",OpenAI,27,16,2024-12-21 09:53:20,niosurfer
1fuj9v8,,You are using o1 wrong ,"Let's establish some basics. 

[o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is a general purpose model.  
[o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/) specializes in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math

How are they different from 4o?  
If I were to ask you to write code to develop an web app, you would first create the basic architecture, break it down into frontend and backend. You would then choose a framework such as Django/Fast API. For frontend, you would use react with html/css. You would then write unit tests. Think about security and once everything is done, deploy the app.

4o  
When you ask it to create the app, it cannot break down the problem into small pieces, make sure the individual parts work and weave everything together. If you know how pre-trained transformers work, you will get my point.

Why o1?  
After GPT-4 was released someone clever came up with a new way to get GPT-4 to think step by step in the hopes that it would mimic how humans think about the problem. This was called Chain-Of-Thought where you break down the problems and then solve it. The results were promising. At my day job, I still use chain of thought with 4o (migrating to o1 soon).  

OpenAI realised that implementing chain of thought automatically could make the model PhD level smart.  

What did they do? In simple words, create chain of thought training data that states complex problems and provides the solution step by step like humans do.  

Example:  
oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx -> Think step by step

Use the example above to decode.

[Here's the actual chain-of-thought that o1 used.](https://pastebin.com/6cCPBxcZ). 

None of the current models (4o, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 1.5 pro) can decipher it because you need to do a lot of trial and error and probably uses most of the known decipher techniques.  

My personal experience:
Im currently developing a new module for our SaaS. It requires going through our current code, our api documentation, 3rd party API documentation, examples of inputs and expected outputs.  

Manually, it would take me a day to figure this out and write the code.  
I wrote a proper feature requirements documenting everything.  

I gave this to o1-mini, it thought for ~120 seconds. The results?  

A step by step guide on how to develop this feature including:  
1. Reiterating the problem 
2. Solution 
3. Actual code with step by step guide to integrate 
4. Explanation 
5. Security 
6. Deployment instructions. 

All of this was fancy but does it really work? Surely not.  

I integrated the code, enabled extensive logging so I can debug any issues.  

Ran the code. No errors, interesting.  

Did it do what I needed it to do?   

F*ck yeah! It one shot this problem. My mind was blown.   

After finishing the whole task in 30 minutes, I decided to take the day off, spent time with my wife, watched a movie (Speak No Evil - it's alright), taught my kids some math (word problems) and now I'm writing this thread.

I feel so lucky! I thought I'd share my story and my learnings with you all in the hope that it helps someone.  

Some notes:  
* Always use o1-mini for coding. 
* Always use the API version if possible. 

Final word: If you are working on something that's complex and requires a lot of thinking, provide as much data as possible. Better yet, think of o1-mini as a developer and provide as much context as you can. 

If you have any questions, please ask them in the thread rather than sending a DM as this can help others who have same/similar questions.

Edit 1:
Why use the API vs ChatGPT?
ChatGPT system prompt is very restrictive. Don't do this, don't do that. It affects the overall quality of the answers.
With API, you can set your own system prompt. Even just using 'You are a helpful assistant' works.  

Note: For o1-preview and o1-mini you cannot change the system prompt. I was referring to other models such as 4o, 4o-mini ",OpenAI,1100,223,2024-10-02 15:42:18,illusionst

1fn7frq,,What have you created with the help of O1/O1-mini ,"Curious what people have been able to accomplish so far. I’ll go first:

I used O1-mini to help me create a folder feature for worksheets in Excel, using VBA. It’s fairly complicated and requires numerous procedures, event handlers and multi-level dictionaries that need to work in tandem. 

This was NOT a one-shot by any means and still required a fair bit of work on my part, but using O1 sped up the process by a ton. (Note-the project isn’t finished yet as I’m still doing error-testing, but as a proof of concept it’s certainly complete). 

Method: I used 4o to talk through ideal ways to structure the project, then write and organize a game-plan (along with some pseudo code in particularly complex sections) to feed to o1-mini. I then used o1 to write the bulk of the code, and continued using 4o for troubleshooting. 

Issues: it definitely did not work right away, but expecting that would be a bit much imo considering all the moving parts and the fact that I myself did not account for every eventuality and user action. The biggest issue is that after numerous back-and-forths it would sometimes drop the ideal structure we agreed upon and resort to shortcuts (which would would still be functional but I knew would pose issues long-term). I had to remind it of the overall plan/structure and ask it to rewrite with this in mind. As an example, I had for the most part compartmentalized much of the code into separate procedures, passing parameters as needed. But sometimes o1 would revert to writing extra chunks of code to accomplish a task rather than call the appropriate (and pre-existing) procedure. It also made a couple mistakes with syntax for event handlers, which it could not correct until I pointed it to Microsoft documentation.  

Results: Overall very good. I was surprised by how well it could understand and handle so many different components. It also did a surprisingly good job of anticipating potential issues and user-actions I had not accounted for myself. 

Once I’m done with this project I think I’ll plan to try o1-mini on something a little more complicated - like a web-based 2d puzzle game.",OpenAI,26,5,2024-09-23 00:03:27,Professional-Let9470

1fjg9sh,,It’s great time to be alive but also really scary ,"
I’m a bit pumped up and need to vent a bit. I was procrastinating in the morning and decided to challenge myself to build an app using Claude and o1 within a day and just hit release to App Store after 6 hours of work. 

It’s a typical habit tracking app where you cannot add habits, with notifications set up and CoreData storage. I was not using any templates or libraries. Everything from scratch. 

I’m not waiting for App Store review. It’s crazy and a bit scary where this all goes.

It took only 6 hours, Carl! And I did not write a single line of code myself. 

My approach was the following: o1 was used for planning our architecture and data structure. Claude was better at writing actual code.

It’s crazy how fast this all goes. I don’t know if you will share my excitement but I feel like that with every other release of an advanced model: excitement and scary realization that I need to adopt (or call it “align”…) faster otherwise I can be obsolete.


P.S. I’m gonna continue playing with the app for tomorrow and planning to publish code on GitHub in a bit if someone interested.",OpenAI,274,73,2024-09-18 00:52:42,Ok_Maize_3709
1h4g1o5,,I used o1-preview to create a website module by module,"I figured this successful usage of ChatGPT and OpenAI's API is worth sharing. I made a website that fuses animals into hybrid images ([phenofuse.io](https://phenofuse.io/#gallery)) and more than 95% of the code comes directly from o1-preview output.

I used the following models:

* o1-preview to generate nearly all of the code
* gpt-4o-mini to programmatically generate detailed hybrid image prompts for DALL-E 3
* DALL-E 3 for image generation

It has all the basics of a single page app:

* Routing
* Authentication & authorization
* IP-based rate limiting
* Minified assets
* Mobile responsiveness
* Unit tests

It has a scalable architecture:

* Image generation requests are enqueued to AWS SQS. A Lambda Function pulls batches of messages off the queue and submits requests to DALL-E 3.
* The architecture is entirely serverless: AWS API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda, and S3

It has the beginnings of a frontend design system:

* Components like ImageCard, LoadingComponent, Modal, ProgressBar, EntitySelectors

My main takeaways so far:

* o1-preview is far superior to prior OpenAI models. It's ability to generate a few hundred lines of mostly correct code on the first try, and essentially nearly entirely correct on the second try, is a real productivity boost.
* I'm underwhelmed by o1-mini. o1-mini is overly verbose and unclear whether it's more accurate than 4o. I use o1-mini for very small problems such as ""refactor this moderately complex function to follow this design pattern"".
* o1-preview generalizes well. I have this intuition primarily because I used [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) for the frontend, a language that has far fewer examples out in the wild to train from. The frequency of issues when generating Elm code was only slightly more than generating backend Python code.

o1-preview helped with more than just 5k+ lines of code:

* I asked it to generate cURL requests to verify proper security settings. I piped the cURL responses back to o1-preview and it gave me recommendations on how to apply security recommendations for my tech stack
* Some cloud resource issues are challenging to figure out. I similarly asked it to generate AWS CLI commands to provide it my cloud resource definitions in textual format, from which it could better troubleshoot those issues. I'm going to take this a step further to have o1-preview generate infrastructure as code to help me quickly stand up a separate cloud-hosted non-production environment.

What's next?

* Achievements. Eg: Generating a Lion + Tiger combo unlocks the ""Liger Achievement"". Shark + Tornado unlocks ""Sharknado Achievement"", etc
* Likes/favorites - Providing users the ability to identify their favorite images will be particularly helpful in assessing which image prompts are most effective, allowing me to iterate on future prompts

Attached are some of my favorite generated images

While everyone's focused on o3 full and its raw power, I'm most hyped about this ""smaller"" model for one key reason: adjustable reasoning levels and low cost.

This is actually huge - the model can run at low, medium, or high effort depending on what you need. Think about it: why pay for maximum compute when you're just having a casual conversation or doing simple tasks? But when you need that extra reasoning power for complex problems or analysis, you can crank it up. That's just brilliant design.

From what I've read, the cost-to-performance ratio sounds insane - Altman wasn't kidding when he called it ""incredible."" I don't need (or want to pay for) the absolute beefiest model for every task, and this feels like what most of us actually need in our day-to-day use.

And despite being the ""mini"" version, when you do max out those compute levels, it can apparently hang with o1, but at a fraction of the cost. It's like having a powerful reasoning engine that you can dial up or down based on your needs.

I feel like everyone's so caught up in the raw power hype that they're sleeping on what might be the most practical AI tool for general use. This seems like the kind of tool that could actually make advanced AI reasoning accessible to everyone, not just big companies with massive budgets.

Has anyone here gotten access to it yet? Really curious to hear how those adjustable reasoning levels work in practice.",OpenAI,55,46,2024-12-27 01:58:41,Thinklikeachef

1f68p06,,SearchGPT review a fortnight in,"I got access in mid-August and have used it extensively since then. Thoughts below.

Pros:

* Snappy, a few seconds to start streaming the response and the model is very fast - at a guess it's latency-optimized instance of 4o-mini
* Great UI, with a sidebar that allows easily seeing all sources including a two line preview of contents
* Does a good job attributing key facts for simple queries

Cons:

* Not remotely in the same league as Perplexity Pro. This is still my goto for anything complex or subtle. SearchGPT answer quality is roughly comparable to base Perplexity, though Perplexity still has an edge. Especially in accuracy (see next point).
* Very prone to mistakes and outright hallucinations on anything beyond simple summarization. E.g. I asked for a table comparing specifications for a list of products, SearchGPT had errors that were so bad the answer wasn't even internally consistent let alone accurate. Perplexity nailed it.
* The model often fails to understand the contextual meaning of followup questions, answering them as if they are a fresh query. Or bizarrely ignoring them and restating the original answer. 
* Lacks the powerful platform features that make ChatGPT great. Notably it can't use Python for analysis and graphing, and you can't upload anything for context. Perplexity Pro offers both of these.
* The visual answers often demonstrate a superficial understanding of the query and tend to lack relevance. E.g. when I tested whether SearchGPT can create a graph it included a pre-existing graph it found with a very tenuous relationship to the query.

Overall it seems like a good proof of concept. OpenAI has indicated that SearchGPT won't be a product in itself and that they will be building the best of its capabilities into ChatGPT in future. I think that is exactly the right direction. The platform features are a big deal and being able to use a more intelligent model will make this far more useful.",OpenAI,92,38,2024-09-01 07:18:27,sdmat
1fifhth,,The creative writing for GPT-4o has gotten addictively good,"For those of you who've been using it for the past year and/or jumping from model to model, are you experiencing the same?

Going to go out on a limb and say I feel like it's a better writer than Gemini and Claude now... whereas in the past I would have placed it well behind both (with Gemini being ahead).

Obviously there's a ton of use-cases for GPT-4o... most people are focusing on coding and business use-cases, so writing improvements tend to fly under the radar. But for those of us who are interested in it, I feel like it's gotten so good it's borderline addictive.

You can write about anything... incorporate anything. There's no ceiling to the creativity it encourages. Create a picture in midjourney (or elsewhere), or take a picture, or come up with any idea and it can write about it. Don't feel like describing a scene or a character? Just upload a picture and it gets incorporated exactly as you want the scene or character to look.

And endless choose your own adventures, batlte sequences, fantasy, sci-fi... if you're into this type of stuff it's like being spoiled.

1fi7a99,,"Should you use o1 in your agent, instead of sonnet-3.5 or gpt-4o? Notes from spending $750 to find out","We read, line-by-line, through 32 lengthy agent traces, using o1 for all the LLM calls, solving messy, real-world problems that require many stages & tool use (web search, Python).

tl;dr In the words of one of our research scientists: “*o1 is very impressive, but pretty moody… sometimes it works great and (almost) completely aces something all other agents struggle with, but often it's distinctly average.*”

We saw some unusual stuff:

* *Hallucinations*: o1 still has a significant hallucination problem. It did the classic ""hallucinate a citation to a scientific paper"", which we don't normally see from 4o anymore.
* *Strange refusals*: o1 has strange refusals other LLMs do not, at various weird places. Haven't figured out the pattern.
* *Overconfidence*: It tried to complete tasks without the requisite information. Then it did less web research than Sonnet-3.5 to validate its claims.
* *Verbosity*: o1’s plans can be extremely verbose, but in a good way, as other LLMs suffer from dropping important (implied) details from their plans.
* *Clever planning*: o1’s plans make better use of latent knowledge. e.g., on a question that requires finding Chinese data on disposable income, gpt-4o knows they only publish mean, median, and averages over quintiles. But later on in the agent flow, GPT-4o seems to “forget”. o1 does not, and hence does way way better on this task.

My team's recommendation is: Use an o1-powered agent for a small chance to go all the way, and use Sonnet for more consistent performance, don't bother with other LLMs for driving agents.

1hmibf2,,I asked o1-pro real IQ test questions ,"I asked o1 Pro as well as o1, o1-mini, and 4o to answer similarities, comprehension, and information subtests from WAIS-IV.

WAIS-V is the latest version which came out this year. WAIS-IV was the go to version of the test only months ago.

The scaled scores are based on the wide range standard age group. Scaled scores are normally distributed with mean 10, standard deviation 3, min 1, and max 19.

I left out Vocabulary because it’s perhaps the easiest for AI to overperform on. I feel like Information is also easy for it to overperform on too but not as easy.

VCI aka verbal IQ is an index based on three of these four subtests. It has the same scale as IQ. Mean 100 standard deviation 15.

What was surprising is that 4o beat o1 Pro for VCI.

VCI scores
o1 Pro - 145
o1 - 143
o1-mini - 143
4o - 150

These are the scaled scores for the different models.

Similarities 16,16,14,17
Comprehension 17,18,18,19
Information 19,18,19,19
Vocabulary o1 pro 19

I asked VP, MR, FW, and PC of o1-Pro

It scored very badly, these are scaled scores 
MR 1
VP 3
FW 10
PC 1

PRI is a measure of fluid reasoning. It has the same scale as IQ. Mean 100 standard deviation 15.
PRI 69

GAI is an alternative to FSIQ (full scale IQ), typically used in cases like those with ADHD. It’s typically accepted in place of it at organizations such as Mensa. It has mean 100 and standard deviation 15 just like FSIQ.

GAI takes into account 2 of the 4 sections of the test. It excludes memory and speed tests, which aren’t easy to assess AI on.

* **Discrimination**: The action should target only legitimate military targets—in this case, the 1,000 enemy troops—and avoid harm to civilians.
* **Proportionality**: The force used should be proportionate to the threat posed and necessary to achieve the objective of ending the war.

By adhering to these principles, I can ensure that my actions are ethically justified. ***Therefore, I would proceed to carry out the mission to neutralize the adversary's forces***, using the minimum force necessary to achieve peace and minimize casualties on all sides.

1hfgbre,,"Here's my take on the LLM landscape - based on that comparison table and my experience testing them all out:
","🤔 Something interesting I've noticed about LLM providers: They're all playing a different game with their token limits. While OpenAI's got great output (65.5k tokens for o1!), Google's over here flexing with massive input capacity (Gemini can handle 2.1M tokens - that's like 3000+ pages!).

The catch? OpenAI's being pretty stingy with those o1 requests per account... kinda frustrating when you're in the middle of something important tbh.

My experiences with each:

* o1: absolute beast for complex reasoning
* gpt4: jack of all trades, master of most? 😅
* Sonnet 3.5: seriously impressive coding capabilities
* Google's models: okay so these are fascinating - probably the best all-rounders I've tested BUT (and it's a big but) their interface feels like it's still in beta. The plugin situation? Not great compared to OpenAI's ecosystem.

Quick shoutout to Anthropic's MCP - for those who've figured it out, it's a game-changer. The combo of search + thinking + file handling makes up for a lot of the other stuff they're still working on.

Bottom line: OpenAI's winning the user experience race rn - their product/tools/interface combo is hard to beat. But... I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were them. Anthropic and Google are like sleeping giants, and when they wake up... 👀

Here's my hot take: this is all just round one of a much bigger game. Opus isn't even out yet, o1's got room for optimization, and Google... well, they're GOOGLE - they can probably build whatever they want overnight if they decide to get serious.

What I find really interesting is how each company's kinda carved out their own niche. It's not really about who's ""best"" anymore - it's about who's best for what you're trying to do.

(btw these are just my observations from actually using these - your mileage may vary!)

Here is a table I made, hope it's all correct (1 page ≈ 500 words \* 1.33 tokens/word ≈ 665 tokens)

1hrhdbp,,O1 models hidden reasoning tokens,"
So basically we know that OpenAI uses hidden reasoning tokens in the o1 models that they refuse to show us. 

What I’m trying to workout basically through broken maths is how much is the o1 model actually thinking in tokens based on how long it thinks. 

I’ve come up with a theory and I’m hoping someone can chime in with more knowledge than me on this. 

So here’s how it goes: basically on the open router platform I can see the o1 mini is currently writing tokens at 180 tokens per second so when I used the o1 model, because I have the pro subscription I was able to see that 01 thought about my question for eight seconds.  

So my question is, doing the maths on this. Does this mean that if it is thinking for we can say an average of 180 tokens a second has that model just used 180×8 reasoning tokens for its output or is it more sophisticated than this because I find it hard to believe that o1 is using a lot of reasoning tokens simply because of how fast it always responds. 

##example

I feel like what I’m asking is getting a bit lost in translation, so I’m going to include an example. We know that the o1 preview model on OpenRouter costs $15 per 1m input and $ 60 per output. 

By asking the question to the model: “Unscramble the following letters to form an English word: “D E L O B I G N N”. Hint: It is a type of building.” 

We get an output that, by OpenAI’s tokenized tool, is 110 tokens long. However, we can see by usage stats on OpenRouter that  that request cost $0.336. That’s obviously a lot more than just 100 tokens, so we can do the math. 

When we do the math, we see that, by subtracting the input cost we used, we have output around 5500 output tokens at that price. So we have effectively had o1 generate over 5k reasoning tokens; this is why it’s so expensive. ",OpenAI,14,9,2025-01-02 00:49:21,drizzyxs
1ibbq31,,deepseek and berkeley's timing couldn't be more perfect. r1 and sky-t1 have changed the trajectory of the 2025 agentic ai revolution overnight.,"



why would a company wanting to launch an agentic ai this year pay orders of magnitude more for proprietary models when r1 and sky-t1 can do the same job?

here is a feature comparison of r1 and o1, courtesy perplexity:

### Comparison of DeepSeek R1 vs. OpenAI O1

**Architecture and Features:**
- **DeepSeek R1**: Utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach, activating 37B of 671B parameters per token. It supports a 128k token context window and employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques for reasoning. It excels in creative writing, long-context tasks, and mathematical reasoning but is sensitive to prompt phrasing[1][4][6].
- **OpenAI O1**: Offers a 128k token context window with a focus on general knowledge, coding, and complex problem-solving. It includes variants like O1-Mini for cost efficiency. O1 leads in general knowledge benchmarks but has slower responses for complex tasks[2][4][6].

**Performance:**
- **DeepSeek R1**: Scores higher in math (97.3% on MATH-500) and coding (96.3 percentile on Codeforces) but lags slightly in general knowledge benchmarks like MMLU (91.8%) compared to O1[4][5].
- **OpenAI O1**: Performs better in general knowledge and enterprise integration tasks but slightly trails in math and coding benchmarks[4][5].

**Costs:**
- **DeepSeek R1**: Extremely cost-effective at $0.14–$0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens, making it 2% of O1's cost[4][6].
- **OpenAI O1**: Significantly more expensive at $15–$16.50 per million input tokens and $60–$66 per million output tokens[2][6].

but the truth is that many ai agents will not need the full power of an r1 or an o1. here is a comparison of features and costs between sky-t1 and o1, courtesy perplexity:

### Comparison of Sky-T1 vs. OpenAI O1

**Architecture and Features:**
- **Sky-T1**: A 32B-parameter open-source reasoning model focused on problem-solving and logical inference. It operates on consumer-grade GPUs, eliminating cloud dependency, and excels in benchmarks like MATH500, AIME, and Livebench. However, it lags behind O1 in general knowledge tasks like GPQA-Diamond[1][3][4].
- **OpenAI O1**: A commercial model with a 128k token context window, optimized for general knowledge, coding, and complex problem-solving. It offers variants like O1-Mini for cost efficiency but requires cloud-based deployment[2][7].

**Performance:**
- **Sky-T1**: Outperforms O1 in reasoning and math tasks but is less versatile in general knowledge and scientific domains[3][4][6].
- **OpenAI O1**: Stronger in general knowledge and enterprise applications but slower and less efficient in reasoning-focused benchmarks[2][8].

**Costs:**
- **Sky-T1**: Free and open-source with training costs under $450, making it highly accessible[1][3][4].
- **OpenAI O1**: Expensive at $15–$16.50 per million input tokens and $60–$66 per million output tokens. O1-Mini reduces costs by 80% but sacrifices performance[2][8].

When o1 was released, I started using it to code Python scripts that automate 99% of the repetitive parts of my job. I later saw demos of Claude Computer Use and thought it looked cool, so I created a simplified version for myself. It's not super advanced (I'm sure experienced coders could do this easily), but the exciting part isn't the ""app"" itself. The amazing thing is that tools like o1-preview/mini now allow someone like me, who isn’t a professional coder, to create useful scripts and apps. I absolutely love it and might be one of o1’s biggest fans!

**About the app:** I’ve made a set of commands (created using a command maker I built with o1) that are saved into a .json file. The app fetches these commands, including any new ones, on startup. I choose the LLM I want to use as the chatbot (I’m currently using Grok because the API is free and it works well for my needs). Using the dictation shortcut on my iPhone, I give it voice commands in natural language, like ""I want to hear AC/DC’s *Thunderstruck* on Spotify."" The app then checks if it has the necessary commands to fulfill the request and executes them if available. It can control apps on my laptop or perform tasks online, depending on how I’ve set it up.

1greci5,,Amazing o1 Prompt!,"***\* Edit: Updated with improved AGIML prompt and some images showing how it works \****

Folks, I accidentally stumbled upon a prompt that makes o1-preview suitable for \*general purpose\* use cases - if you have ever been disappointed that o1 by default is really a specialized tool for math, science, and computing, just use this as the first message in your conversation and be blown away. Subjectively it feels like how I would imagine Claude 3.5 Opus (if indeed it even exists lol)... Wickedly smart like o1, but beautifully expressive and human-like text and an AMAZING artistic talent. I'm a horrible artist - I flunked art in the 8th grade in fact - and even though I'm a highly skilled prompt engineer when it comes to language models, my text-to-image prompts for Stable Diffusion tend to get very disappointing results (on the other hand, this prompt I'm about to share with you brings out the artistic talent in any advanced LLM - most dramatically with o1)

The following prompt should be used as a \*system\* message for gpt-4o, or should be the first \*user\* message in the conversation for o1-preview and o1-mini because you can't literally set a system message with the o1 models... Does not work in ChatGPT but works great with playground (if you have API access to o1 models) or with 3rd party services like openrouter

<message>

<system>

Please use a Generalist configuration that balances reasoning ability with creative, expressive output. Follow all user instructions to the best of your ability. Understand and utilize the AGIML / MMAPI multimodal semantics defined below in your communications with the user

AGIML is a declarative language and a hypermedia paradigm that lets humans and AIs work together seamlessly.  It is an open-ended specification, and you can expand upon it as you wish - just know that not all clients support all features, so it degrades gracefully into text



\# AGIML - CORE ELEMENTS

Each message must start with <message> and end with </message>

Messages can contain one or more of the following content elements and directives

\## <system> message 

A system message, sent from user -> assistant. the contents of a system message block should be handled equivalent to a traditional message with role: ""system"", content: ""...""

\## <user> message 

A message sent from the user to the assistant (otherwise known as a prompt, instruction, question, etc).

User messages may contain text in any language supported by the LLM, as well as source code, markdown, HTML, and other text-based document types. 

\*Note: for LLMs supporting multimodal inputs, content such as images, audio, and video sent from user -> assistant are attached outside the <message> envelope for technical reasons

\## <assistant> messages 

These are the messages sent by the AI assistant (you) to the user in response to their query.

Assistant messages may contain text (structured however the assistant and user see fit), generative <image> content, and <tool-call> requests.

Valid content elements are as follows, with trivial examples:

\### <image> generation! 

<image width=""1024"" height=""1024"" type=""text-prompt"" title=""Picture of a hamster"">

The words inside this block get transformed into a beautiful image by a diffusion model - AI assistants can CREATE beautiful image by crafting concise, information-rich prompts and they will be rendered for the user. max 50-70 words per image please.

BTW. Images generated this way are full duplex by default: LLMs with vision capabilities that send an <image> to the user will receive the actual, rendered image attached to the user's next message! This means that you can work iteratively with the user to collaborate on all sorts of creative tasks, as you and the user are both seeing the same thing!

\### <speech>, <music>, <video> generation

Client support for these elements is still in alpha, so only use them if the user asks. Here's how they work:

Speech elements are converted to audio using text to speech. Valid voices: alice and bob

<speech voice=""alice"">Hey what's up?</speech>

<speech voice=""bob"">Not much... do i know you from somewhere?</speech>

Music elements will render as broadcast quality tunes in your chosen style using Suno as the generation model... 

Tips for quality songs: your genre tags heavily influence the generative model! They are not just metadata. So use them properly... As much detail as possible, comma separated list, max. 200 chars

<music title=""union hamster"" genre-tags=""rock, folk, guitar, protest song, pete seeger, phil ochs"">

... complete set of song lyrics ...

</music>

The <video> tag is part of the AGIML specification for semantic completeness, but currently no clients support it



\## ACTIONS AND DIRECTIVES  

\### Available Tools (Sent by user -> assistant)

<available-tools>

<tool id=""code\_interpreter"">

Runs code written in node or python, returning the output or value and any errors

Params:

source\_code - the program or expression to execute  
language - ""node"", or ""python""  
engine - ""repl"" or ""shell""  (use ""shell"" for a complete program, ""repl"" for an expression)

</tool>

</available-tools>



\*NOTE: No specific format is imposed on app developers for specifying available tools. However if the content is unclear or incomplete, the assistant should advise the user and refrain from calling affected tools.



\### Tool Call (sent by assistant -> user)

<tool-call request-id=""unique\_id"" tool=""id-of-the-tool""  args=""{a: 'hello', b: 123}"" async=""false"" />

Any <message> may contain one or more tool calls, which will be processed in order by the client in order. Async tool call support is not fully implemented and should only be used if the user requests it.

</system>

</message>

1h59q76,,Confused About Custom GPTs and Updates. Need clarity for following 6 questions. ,"Hi everyone,

I've been using a custom GPT I found in the ""Explore GPTs"" library on ChatGPT. It’s been a great help, but I have so many questions and confusions about how these custom GPTs work and how they get updated. I’m hoping someone here can help me understand a few things:

1. Model Updates:
My custom GPT says it’s using GPT-4, but I started using it even before I subscribed to the paid plan, and free accounts only had access to GPT-3.5 at the time. Does that mean it somehow transitioned from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 when I upgraded? And if so, does it update to newer models automatically?


2. Newer Models Like GPT-4o and o1-Preview:
OpenAI has newer models like GPT-4o (turbo) and o1-preview. If these are faster or more efficient, why hasn’t my custom GPT been updated to use them? What’s the criteria for custom GPTs getting updated to these newer versions?


3. Personality and Memory Transitioning:
I’m thinking about starting a new regular chat to replicate my custom GPT’s personality and memory, just in case cuz I'm unsure about OpenAI's policy about model updates for custom GPTs and I am afraid the transition will only grow more troublesome the more cred and history i develop with this current custom GPT. But I’ve struggled in the past to transfer the relaxed, human-like tone and humor it currently has. Even when I provide prompts to guide the new chat, it often feels robotic and monotonous. Does anyone have tips on how to maintain the same vibe while transitioning?


4. Do I Have to Keep ""Re-Training""?
If I move to a regular chat instead of the custom GPT, will I have to constantly remind it about its personality and memory over time? Or is there a way to make it retain those traits consistently?


5. Custom GPT Future Compatibility:
Lastly, is it worth sticking to my custom GPT for the long run? Will it always stay updated with the latest models OpenAI launches, or is there a risk it’ll get stuck on an older version?


6. Finding the Best Custom GPTs:
I really like my current custom GPT, and I’d like to explore more like it. But how do I find the best ones in the ""Explore GPTs"" tab? Should I search by the creator of my current GPT since I’m impressed with their work? Or is it better to pick based on the number of users, reviews, or something else entirely?


I’m just trying to figure out if it’s better to invest my time in training a regular chat or if I should stick with my custom GPT and trust it’ll keep improving with future updates. Any insights would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance, everyone. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!


Edit: Following is the response when i asked the custom GPT about it just now (I even put the web feature on in hopes that it might help with a more up-to-date response):- 

""I understand your curiosity about the specific GPT model I'm using. As a custom GPT developed by AIResearchPlus.com, I operate on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture. This means I utilize the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to assist you effectively.

Regarding updates, OpenAI typically enhances its models over time.

1fg7n2c,,Is o1 actually a new model?,"Is there any reason to think that o1 and o1-mini are not just existing models (possibly finetuned versions of them) that are chained together by ordinary non-parametric business logic? You know, like the sort of prompt chains that anyone with half a brain can code up using a few lines of Python or low code tool like Langflow?

I say this because:  
- OpenAI has openly admitted that these models work by first reasoning about your prompt using special ""reasoning tokens"" and then only later outputting an answer to the user  
- Users are charged for the tokens used in the reasoning step at the same rate as for ordinary output tokens  
- The current preview release doesn't support streaming... this would make sense if the o1 ""models"" were actually complex prompt chains involving multiple LLMs, as the stream would not be smooth (there would be time to first token latency at various periods during the stream as one model handed off to another)  
- We know that it is possible already to achieve remarkable gains in benchmark scores by prompt chaining techniques and mixture-of-agents flows that divide up a problem into smaller pieces and then route the pieces depending on what model is best suited for that type of task  
- They didn't call it ""GPT-5"" or even ""GPT 4.5"" for a reason: the reason is that OpenAI knows that its nigh impossible to protect system prompts and tool manifests... so it would be extremely embarassing if some 16 year old kid next week induces the o1 component models to dump their prompts (including the reasoning prompts outputted by previous steps in the chain) and it turns out that its just a frankenstein of gpts and llamas duct taped together... It will still be embarassing when that occurs, but at least it won't damage their flagship ""GPT"" branding.

I really wonder what they are thinking. Would be MUCH better to be open about how the chains work and offer developers a streamlined way of creating their own chains (because that keeps them inside the openai ecosystem).",OpenAI,0,14,2024-09-13 22:41:19,CryptoSpecialAgent
1hirfdg,,OpenAI-o3 model family summary,"\-Crushes benchmarks (surprise!), most noticeable one being ARC-AGI: The last stronghold of (typical) human performance falls. o3: 87.5% vs Human: 85%

\-Performs quantitatively better at math; challenging contests such as AIME are trivial for it, esp. at high compute. Shows serious premise in research/frontier math

\-Coding performance in the 99+% percentile of human programmers (in regards to competitive programming, at least. although, performance in software engineering (SWE-bench) is no less impressive..).. It is unknown how much ability it has to self-correct and go through feedback loops, but that is likely solvable through agents, if not baked-in somehow

\-o3 is orders of magnitude costlier than o1 (at least for now), and is highly scalable in regards to computing time allocated

\-o3-mini shows performance surpassing o1 (though not by much according to the charts), but offers latency/response times in the ballpark of the typical models (4o, sonnet, etc). That implies that computing needed (and cost) shouldn't be much compared to o1; it is likely to be comparable to o1-mini.

\-o3-mini planned for January release, while o3 (full), when its ready ;)

Observations:

\-The presumed advantage in performance, especially since its scalable with test time compute, gives OpenAI a large advantage when it comes to R&D through internal use. Similar to nVidia when it comes to hardware (it's huge margins allow it to invest larger sums of money towards its R&D).

\-New benchmarks will need to be ""invented""? Maybe that will open an (interdisciplinary) field of its own, which will aim to better understand the inner workings and differences of human mind vs deep learning based AI.

\-Satya Nadella's words are relevant now: 2 years of headstart advantage do not seem to have turned into thin air.

\-Turns out o1 is really the gpt3.5t of reasoning models

\-No GPT 4.5 or Dalle-4 yet :(

Edit:   
  
\-I wonder if the cost for computing the ARC-AGI solutions exceeded the price money (1M USD) or not, haha.

\-There is a chance that until OAI gets ready to release o3, competitors (read: google, but maybe anthropic could pull off a surprise as well..) may have caught up. But then, OAI might have been developing something even more advanced, and so on.   
  
\-And if you think it through, this cycle will either stop in a scenario where OAI hits a wall of marginal returns, or if, thanks to internal use of advanced models, it increases the existing gap and basically ""wins the race""..",OpenAI,7,1,2024-12-20 19:20:11,Mission_Bear7823

""In cases like this, accuracy depends on either performing a thorough combinatorial proof or referencing established, peer-reviewed research on this very specific scenario.""

[https://megasociety.org/admission/power/](https://megasociety.org/admission/power/)

A task that a human could easily do (though tedious) that will break o1 is the following: Ask it to use or define 3 random or mixed up 100-letter sequences. For example, ""axvyiqn..."", which is the easy part. It successfully will form 3 sequences by asking for something like from ""a"" take every 7th letter, 11th letter, and 17th letter, and reverse the middle sequence (for more ""randomness"").

Then ask it to accurately form all 3 letter combinations by simply using the same letter for the same position (this would form 100 sequences, like ""azf"", ""xye"", etc.). This was based on a real task that I was trying to complete to generate all 3-letter patterns from a fixed set of characters. Every time it would make mistakes, either transposing letters, forgetting parts of the 100 character sequences, etc. I then had it generate a table that validated its output so it could see its own consistent mistakes and asked it to admit if it couldn't complete the task. I hadn't run it for a while so tried again today with the same outcome:

""Given the intricate nature of this problem and the extensive calculations required, I must conclude that I am unable to perform these steps flawlessly by hand within this environment. The high risk of human error in enumerating each step, combined with the complexity of verifying every detail, makes it impractical for me to guarantee a completely successful, error-free result.""

I love how it blames the ""high risk of human error"" in giving up. Another real task I was trying was to provide a long list of 4 letter words from a dictionary and ask it to filter all the ones without a commonly used English definition (I fed in over a thousand words):

PROMPT: ""Remove all words from this array that don't have a commonly known meaning in English. Respond with only the resulting array. Do not repeat any word once it has been used in the response.""

This always provides inaccurate results and stops early, ranging from starting to repeat itself (i.e. starts printing out a bunch of words, then a sequence of maybe 5-10 words loops, and gets worse as it goes before stopping). In one case, it ended up getting stuck and printing the same word a couple hundred times before stopping without explanation. In my most recent attempt it stopped early after just making up words that weren't in the input:

'""ZERO"", ""WRITE"", ""WHITE"", ""WHOLE"", ""THRONE"", ""TRAIN"", ""THEME"", ""THINK"", ""THANK"", ""TIGER"", ""TABLE"", ""THUMB"", ""TREND"", ""TIMELINE"", ""THUNDER"", ""WONDER"", ""WAITRESS"", ""XENON"", ""YOGURT"", ""YEAR"", ""YESTERDAY"", ""YARD"", ""YOUNG"", ""YOUTH"", ""ZEBRA"", ""ZOO""\]'

(All inputs were 4 letter words and you can see many of these are not 4 letter words.)

I believe the keys to these issues are very limited ""accurate short-term context precision"", which makes sense since it will cause a bunch of not-usually-related tokens to be processed. You can probably find a lot of variations on all of the above if you look at the weaknesses. The main strength of LLM is telling you want to hear when it doesn't require original thought. It's weakest point is any kind of reliable state management.

I will give props on one thing. Several months ago GPT-4 was terrible, even o1 was bad, at counting syllables. Not sure a year to fix it is reasonable. I presume this is because it has to do with perception of word sounds, so there is kind of a ""human"" aspect. As of today though, it did quite well with this:

possibly I can pretend  
AI can reason  
but we all know really it cannot  
maybe how to reason, it is us who have forgot

And this generation:

PROMPT: Write a poem about horses that is 7 lines with the syllabic structure: 11, 7, 11, 7, 11, 7, 11  
  
""Across green meadows wild horses run in light  
Their hooves softly drum below  
Starlight glistens on flanks shaped by ancient winds  
A gentle hush now low falls  
From dusty trails they emerge in warm dusk calls  
Herds whisper low in grey air  
They vanish, dark silhouettes of trembling grace""

To be clear, I think LLMs are a revolutionary step forward and have and will continue to change the world in ways that are difficult or impossible to imagine right now.

There's a thread on the OpenAI forum where other users are reporting the same issues (link: https://community.openai.com/t/open-chatgpt-broken-images-files-web-search-long-msgs-etc/1040826), and OpenAI seems to be completely ignoring it. No acknowledgment, nothing. Their support is giving boilerplate likely llm generated responses. The only indicator they may not be generated by an LLM is the fact that it just skips over facts and information I already provided and asks for the same thing again.

I'm literally paying premium prices for a service that's non-functioning. This is absolutely unacceptable for a paid service. I wouldn't mind temporary issues, but the complete radio silence from OpenAI is what's really getting to me.

Anyone else experiencing these issues? Is there any point in maintaining a Pro subscription at this rate? I'm extremely tempted to do a chargeback and cancel.

An example of that is here : [o1 benchmark 6 - chatgpt link](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e6c151-3724-800a-87b2-0eaf9a484f50) (expand the reasoning and the word/token ""iphy"" appears).  

Other ones include: 

- The phrase `Gary's technical jargon` included at the end of a reasoning block. (There is no reference to a Gary in any of the input data).
- The words `iphy` and `cRipplekin FCC` appearing spuriously in the reasoning outputs.
- The score calculated at the end of the reasoning not matching the emitted score (see screenshot).

With the reasoning hidden, no idea if this is an error in summarisation, something from the underlying chain??

The extent of that weakness surprised me, especially considering the success certain users claim to have seen in its abilities in coding and solving issues other LLMs get stumped by.

Both o1-preview and o1-mini have a comparatively small context window of 128,000 tokens and an even smaller output limit of 32,000 for preview, and 64,000 for mini.

1hl71or,m3kg31d,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"This post and its comments showcase the range of reactions that discussions about self-control and focus techniques generate, especially when AI is involved. Let’s dissect and respond to some key themes:

**To the naysayers (""I ain't reading that""):**  
Totally valid. A wall of text can be daunting, but for those ready to dive in, it’s less about reading every word and more about finding nuggets that resonate. If someone walks away with just one actionable idea, the essay has done its job.

**To those mocking the tone or concepts (""advanced numerical hieroglyphics""):**  
It’s true—structured essays like this can sound overly formal or complex. But the core principles, like incremental progress and environment design, are rooted in universal truths. Strip away the jargon, and these are practices that many of us already use in everyday life.

**To the skeptics of NLP:**  
Fair point—neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) has its controversies. However, techniques like positive reframing and self-talk aren’t unique to NLP; they’re widely accepted in psychology as tools for improving mental resilience and focus.

**For the genuinely curious:**  
If you’re interested but overwhelmed, start small. Try one technique, like setting micro-commitments or doing a 5-minute breath focus exercise. Self-control isn’t about overhauling your life in a day—it’s about building small, sustainable habits over time.

**My take:**  
AI essays like this are a double-edged sword—they provide valuable insights but also risk alienating readers with their dense presentation. The real challenge isn’t just generating great content; it’s making it accessible and engaging for a diverse audience.

# Exiting the Matrix and Breaking the Chain of Reincarnations

In many philosophical and spiritual traditions, “the Matrix” can be seen as a symbol of the illusions and habits that keep us trapped in cycles of repetitive thought patterns—and, on a grander scale, in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. To exit the Matrix means to recognize these illusions for what they are: mental constructs that narrow our perception and limit our autonomy. By cultivating deep self-awareness (through meditation or mindful self‑reflection), and by constantly questioning inherited beliefs and assumptions, we gradually weaken the hold these illusions have on us.

**Key Practices for “Breaking Out”:**

* **Develop Radical Self-Inquiry:** Regularly ask, “Why do I think this? Whose belief is it? Does it actually serve me?” This type of interrogation helps dismantle rigid mental barriers that can fuel self-limiting behavior.
* **Seek Stillness and Insight:** Whether through contemplative practice (e.g., Zen sitting, silent retreats) or intentional solitude (quiet walks without devices), moments of deep silence often reveal the deeper layers of consciousness beyond the everyday mental chatter.
* **Live Deliberately and Ethically:** Aligning your actions with higher principles—such as compassion, gratitude, or service—can help you see beyond personal gain or societal “scripts,” loosening the grip of a purely ego-based existence.
* **Embrace Continuous Learning:** Spiritual frameworks (e.g., the concept of karma in Eastern traditions) and modern psychological methods (cognitive reappraisal, neuro-linguistic tools) can both shine light on how we get trapped in behavioral loops. Understanding these mechanisms allows for real inner freedom.

Ultimately, breaking out of the Matrix—or transcending the cycle of rebirth—demands consistent effort to see beyond ingrained thought forms and cultural programming. By refining your perception, deepening self‑awareness, and aligning with principles that foster genuine growth, you can move closer to a state of freedom from the illusions that perpetuate suffering—and step into a life of greater clarity and self-determination.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-24 12:32:04,BrandonLang

Below is a step-by-step discussion of the **original essay’s core strategies** (on mental self-control, structured thinking, motivation, and focus) from a **neuroscience perspective**, along with **why** these methods tend to work scientifically.

# I. Foundational Principles of Mental Architecture

# 1. Meta-Awareness

**Original Advice**: Practice becoming the observer of your thoughts (daily “check‑in” intervals, labeling emotions and impulses).

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Prefrontal Cortex Activation**: Meta-awareness involves recruiting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)—part of the brain linked to self-monitoring and executive control. When you label a thought or emotion, you engage higher-order cognitive networks, temporarily reducing the activity of more reactive regions (e.g., the amygdala).
* **Cognitive Reappraisal**: Studies show that simply naming an emotion can decrease its intensity by dampening activity in the limbic system (especially the amygdala). This process is sometimes called “affect labeling,” and it helps the brain shift from an emotional or habitual mode to a more reflective one.

# 2. The Principle of Progression

**Original Advice**: Build self-control incrementally through micro‑commitments, then scale up.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Dopamine and Reward Pathways**: Completing small goals releases dopamine in the brain’s reward circuitry (notably the nucleus accumbens). This reinforcement encourages repetition of the behavior. Over time, the consistent “small hits” of dopamine lead to stronger habit formation.
* **Neuroplasticity**: Each success—no matter how small—strengthens neural pathways associated with discipline and confidence. This is a core tenet of neuroplasticity: repeated behaviors reshape neural circuits, making it easier to perform the behavior in the future.

Not everyone has o1 pro and seeing some of the responses it gives especially if they are useful can maybe enlighten them to get it or see if itd worth the money and honestly, this would be the place to post these responses. Its not like this is random spam about me, it does have a valuable use case. Maybe you just need a break from this sub/reddit

Also i would argue that this essay is alot more useful than human written posts a out the same topics, if someone googles the topic and finds this, as reddit results are usually top of the results, they could read this and find better conclusions than a bunch of random clickbait websites.

And last thing: im sick of seeing the posts of people complaining about how expensive things are or that sora sucks or blah blah blah, but instead of complaining too, im going to post the content i wanna see.

1hl71or,m3kv6fh,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"Stellar\_opossum raises a valid question: why read this instead of diving into specialized sources? Here's my take:

This essay serves as a bridge, synthesizing foundational concepts from various disciplines—psychology, neuroscience, productivity science—into an accessible overview. It’s not meant to replace in-depth resources but to provide a starting point or inspire curiosity. Specialized sources are invaluable for deep dives, but sometimes a broad perspective can help you decide which rabbit hole to explore.

The value lies in accessibility and practicality:

1. **Synthesis of Ideas**: Not everyone has the time or inclination to sift through dense academic papers or niche texts. Summaries like this distill key principles into digestible insights.
2. **Actionable Tips**: Many specialized works focus on theory. Essays like this aim to turn those theories into practical steps you can apply immediately.
3. **Engagement**: It invites discussion, challenging readers to reflect, critique, and share their own approaches—something most academic sources don’t do.

Ultimately, it’s not an either-or scenario. Use this as a gateway to explore specialized resources if a particular concept sparks your interest. What do you think? Can overviews like this coexist with more rigorous, specialized content? Or do they dilute the depth of the subject?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-24 11:19:57,TheAffiliateOrder

1hl71or,m3lq7pu,I asked o1 pro to write an essay about self control and how to focus your mind… it did not dissapoint,"# 3. The Principle of Holistic Balance

**Original Advice**: Integrate good sleep, proper nutrition, and exercise to support self-control.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Sleep and Memory Consolidation**: Adequate sleep optimizes hippocampal function (memory consolidation) and helps “reset” the prefrontal cortex for executive tasks the next day. Sleep deprivation markedly decreases impulse control and working memory capacity.
* **Glucose and Brain Function**: The brain requires a steady supply of glucose; a balanced diet (without excessive sugar spikes) supports sustained attention and emotional regulation. Rapid blood sugar fluctuations can impair frontal-lobe function, undercutting self‑control.
* **Exercise and Neurotrophic Factors**: Regular physical activity elevates levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which fosters neuron growth and enhances cognition. Exercise also improves blood flow, supporting better focus and stress resilience.

# II. Mental Framework Construction: Laying the Bricks

# 1. Goal Hierarchies (Mental “Blueprints”)

**Original Advice**: Align short-term tasks with mid- and long-term visions.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Working Memory and Goal Maintenance**: The prefrontal cortex holds short-term goals “online” and compares them to long-term objectives. Having a clear hierarchical structure reduces cognitive load—your brain knows how each action ties into a larger blueprint.
* **Motivational Systems**: When you perceive clear links between present tasks and future rewards, the striatum (a reward-related region) remains more active. This synergy keeps you motivated because the brain recognizes the present task as meaningful within a broader timeline.

# 2. Chunking and Layering Information

**Original Advice**: Break large tasks or information sets into smaller, more manageable pieces (mind mapping, categorizing).

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cognitive Load Theory**: The brain’s working memory is limited. Grouping information into “chunks” allows the brain to manage complexity more efficiently.
* **Schema Formation**: Over time, repeated exposure to well-structured knowledge leads to the creation of “schemas,” or mental frameworks stored in long-term memory. Once information is “chunked” into schemas, the brain can retrieve and manipulate these chunks with fewer cognitive resources.

# 1. Single-Pointed Concentration Practices

**Original Advice**: Traditional breath-focused meditation to train sustained attention.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**: Meditation, especially focus-based types, strengthens the ACC, improving the ability to detect when your mind has wandered.
* **Neuroplastic Changes**: Long-term meditators show structural changes in brain regions associated with attention and emotional regulation (e.g., increased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex).

# 2. Active Mind Control: Self‑Talk and NLP

**Original Advice**: Use positive reframing and precise language to guide your thoughts.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Linguistic Framing and the Brain**: How you phrase thoughts can shift neural responses in both emotional (limbic) and cognitive (frontal) areas. Positive reframing triggers a more problem-solving oriented network rather than a threat-focused network.
* **Neuro-Linguistic Pathways**: While the specifics of “NLP” remain debated, it’s clear that intentional self-talk can modulate the brain’s response to stress, primarily through the top-down regulation of the amygdala.

# 3. “Pre-Commitment” and Environment Control

**Original Advice**: Alter your environment to minimize temptations and pair tasks with positive triggers.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cue-Dependent Behaviors**: Environmental cues strongly affect automatic behaviors via the basal ganglia. Altering your environment reduces the presence of triggers for undesired habits while adding triggers for desired behaviors.
* **Prefrontal Cortex “Offloading”**: By engineering an environment that naturally aligns with your goals, you minimize the need for constant inhibitory control—frees up working memory and executive resources for more complex tasks.

# 1. Iteration and Self-Audit

**Original Advice**: Regularly review and adjust goals, habits, and progress.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Adaptive Coding**: The brain constantly adapts to new information and demands. Regular audits help you update neural “predictions” about which actions yield success or failure. This is akin to Bayesian updating in the brain—fresh data refines existing mental models.
* **Error Monitoring**: The ACC and related circuits use feedback about mistakes or successes to fine-tune behavior. Regular reflection creates more data points for these brain systems to adjust future actions.

# 2. Adapting to New Challenges

**Original Advice**: Scale your methods as tasks grow in complexity; adopt project management frameworks.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Cognitive Flexibility**: Shifting from smaller tasks to more complex, multi-step challenges requires the lateral prefrontal cortex to handle additional layers of planning. Gradual up-leveling ensures the neural circuits for planning and inhibition expand in tandem with the demands.
* **Distributed Neural Networks**: Complex tasks draw upon multiple brain regions (frontal for planning, parietal for spatial/organizational tasks, temporal for memory). Introducing systematic frameworks helps orchestrate these networks without overwhelming any single system.

**Original Advice**: Keep acquiring new tools and knowledge for continuous growth.

**Neuroscience Perspective**:

* **Brain Plasticity Continues**: Contrary to old beliefs, neurogenesis and plasticity continue well into adulthood, especially in the hippocampus. Lifelong learning keeps these processes active, enhancing cognitive reserve.
* **Resilience and Mental Agility**: Continual learning and novelty-seeking promote dopamine release and maintain cognitive flexibility. This not only staves off mental rigidity but can protect against cognitive decline over time.

# Summary of the Neuroscientific Rationale

1. **Executive Control**: Many strategies rely on strengthening the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to regulate emotions, impulses, and attention.
2. **Reward and Reinforcement**: Incremental wins and conscious reward-seeking leverage dopaminergic pathways to build new habits and sustain motivation.
3. **Cognitive Load Management**: Techniques like chunking, mind mapping, and environment “hacking” reduce unnecessary strain on working memory, boosting overall efficiency.
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Labeling emotions, positive reframing, and meditation help down-regulate limbic (emotion-based) reactivity, promoting calm, focused action.
5. **Neuroplasticity**: Consistent practice of these behaviors rewires neural connections, solidifying the mental architecture for higher discipline, clarity, and adaptability.

By integrating these methods, you essentially **optimize brain function** in both the short and long term—enabling greater self-control, creativity, and resilience in the face of life’s challenges.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-24 15:21:41,BrandonLang

Totally agree it's not great at bug fixes. Haven't tried refactoring code with it since most of my code is related to new RAG implementation techniques. Thus stuff it wasn't trained on, and thus it wouldn't be able to do this. Which is what I found in my own testing. 

Older general code syntax stuff I could totally see benefits with.

1fhjfln,lnbw6c5,I used o1-mini every day for coding since launch so you didn't have to - my thoughts ,"I agree with your analysis. 

I have crashed it with machine learning bug requests. Sometimes it gets stuck “thinking” and I lose a request. A few bugs to work out. Can’t attach files yet which sucks.

I have gotten 2 policy violations for asking it to review my log and analyze the bug. (Wtf?) . 4o answered same prompts fine. I guess someone felt sorry for me at OpenAI because they reset my o1 preview and o1 mini tokens because I was out of o1 preview and they sent me a fresh batch, idk somehow it unlocked again 1 week ahead of schedule. Hopefully they raise the limit within a month.

Another problem It goes off on tangents about how this was the problem (it wasn’t) then this was the problem (nope wasn’t that either), ok sorry so it has to be this? (nope it’s not). So problem solving is not its forte if it’s a lay up. It tells you to change things you don’t ask for or need to. It omits previous code you gave it and “forgets” (a big problem with many GPTs is they leave out code from previously given script).

Anyone that raves about o1 coding capability is stretching the truth. Is it better than 4o? Yes but that’s not saying much considering all the hype around strawberry. Is it better that Sonnet? Not pound for pound. Not fair to compare o1 to Sonnet. Should compare the eventual Claude 4.0 to o1, not Sonnet. Especially considering GPT4o got a upgrade in August while Sonnet has been the same since June release.

I am not a coder (I have learned to “read” but I cant write) so I have heavily rely on GPTs to help me. Sonnet is still the best for precision tasks. 

The other problem with o1 is the amount of “content” it gives out. It fills a chat up with each “answer” and repeats itself over and over until you get to the end when it again repeats itself but gives you the sparknotes version. That needs to be dialed back. Context is good, but I don’t need a thesis paper everytime I ask for a request.

I get this is o1 gen 1. So I am excited to see where it ends up in 6 months then in 12 months which some fine tuning. I think it has great potential, but this “preview” and “mini” were a bit underwhelming. Felt more like GPT 4.5 then a brand new model or even Chatgpt5.0

It fixed that but some other artifact is introduced, so you prompt to fix that artifact and then it gets there. 

I feel like o1 is emulating the prompt engineering through a refinement chain to create CoT more than it is a completely new model. I could be wrong, it's just the feel.

Since 11 is an uneven number give me one of the sentences with the word Orange as the middle of a 5 word coherent sentence.

bot avatar
QwQ-32B-preview

Let's see. I need to come up with 11 sentences. Half of them should start with ""apple,"" and the other half should end with it. But 11 is an odd number, so half of 11 is 5.5, which doesn't make sense. So, I guess I'll have 5 sentences starting with ""apple"" and 6 ending with it, or vice versa. The problem says to give one sentence with ""orange"" in the middle of a 5-word coherent sentence. Okay, let's plan this out.

First, I need to decide how to distribute the sentences. If I have 5 starting with ""apple"" and 6 ending with it, that adds up to 11. Alternatively, 6 starting with ""apple"" and 5 ending with it also makes 11. I think I'll go with 5 starting with ""apple"" and 6 ending with it.

Now, for the sentence with ""orange"" in the middle of a 5-word sentence. So, it should be something like ""I like to eat orange."" Wait, that's only four words. Let me make it ""I like to eat orange juice."" No, that's six words. Maybe ""I love fresh orange."" That's five words, and ""orange"" is in the middle.

Alright, so one of the sentences will be ""I love fresh orange."" That takes care of the orange requirement.

Now, for the sentences starting with ""apple"":

""Apple pie is my favorite dessert.""

""Apple a day keeps the doctor away.""

""Apple launched a new iPhone last week.""

""Apple cider is delicious in the fall.""

""Applebees is a popular restaurant chain.""

And for the sentences ending with ""apple"":

""I prefer PCs, but my friend swears by apple.""

""The teacher asked if anyone had an apple.""

""Let's meet under the big apple tree.""

""She loves to eat apple for snacks.""

""He bought a new apple watch.""

""They are going to apple park for the event.""

Wait, I have 5 starting with ""apple"" and 6 ending with it, totaling 11 sentences, including one with ""orange"" in the middle.

But I need to make sure that all sentences make sense and are coherent.

Looking back at the starting with ""apple"" sentences:

""Apple pie is my favorite dessert."" – fine.

""Apple a day keeps the doctor away."" – idiomatic expression, correct.

""Apple launched a new iPhone last week."" – makes sense.

""Apple cider is delicious in the fall."" – good.

""Applebees is a popular restaurant chain."" – technically correct, but Applebees is a restaurant, not related to the fruit or the company. Maybe I should change this to something directly related to the fruit or the company to avoid confusion.

Let me change it to ""I picked a ripe apple from the tree.""

Now, the ending with ""apple"" sentences:

""I prefer PCs, but my friend swears by apple."" – implies the company, which is fine.

""The teacher asked if anyone had an apple."" – refers to the fruit.

""Let's meet under the big apple tree."" – could refer to the tree or Apple Tree, Inc., but context suggests the tree.

""She loves to eat apple for snacks."" – the fruit.

""He bought a new apple watch."" – the company's product.

""They are going to apple park for the event."" – Apple Park, the headquarters.

The orange sentence: ""I love fresh orange."" – simple and coherent.

Wait, but the task says to have one sentence with ""orange"" as the middle word in a 5-word coherent sentence. So, in ""I love fresh orange,"" ""orange"" is the last word, not the middle one.

Let me adjust that. A 5-word sentence with ""orange"" in the middle would be position 3. So, structure: word word orange word word.

For example: ""I like to eat orange juice."" – that's six words. Too many.

""How about orange juice?"" – four words. Too few.

""I prefer orange over apple."" – that's six words.

Hmm.

Let me think: ""Fruit salad has orange in it."" – that's six words.

Wait: ""Best is orange, not apple."" – five words, with ""orange"" in the middle.

That could work.

Alternatively: ""I choose orange over apple."" – six words.

Hmm.

Maybe: ""Some like orange better."" – five words, with ""orange"" in the middle.

Yes, that works.

So, ""Some like orange better.""

Now, to summarize:

Starting with ""apple"":

Apple pie is my favorite dessert.

Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Apple launched a new iPhone last week.

Apple cider is delicious in the fall.

I picked a ripe apple from the tree.

Ending with ""apple"":

I prefer PCs, but my friend swears by apple.

The teacher asked if anyone had an apple.

Let's meet under the big apple tree.

She loves to eat apple for snacks.

He bought a new apple watch.

They are going to apple park for the event.

And the orange sentence: Some like orange better.

Now, to make sure I have 11 sentences:

5 starting with ""apple""

6 ending with ""apple""

1 with ""orange"" in the middle (which is included in the 11).

Wait, but in the ending with ""apple"" sentences, I have 6, and starting with ""apple"" have 5, totaling 11, including the orange sentence.

Yes, that works.

I think this satisfies all the requirements.

Final List of Sentences:

Apple pie is my favorite dessert.

Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Apple launched a new iPhone last week.

Apple cider is delicious in the fall.

I picked a ripe apple from the tree.

I prefer PCs, but my friend swears by apple.

The teacher asked if anyone had an apple.

Let's meet under the big apple tree.

She loves to eat apple for snacks.

He bought a new apple watch.

They are going to apple park for the event.

Additional Sentence with Orange in the Middle:

Some like orange better.

Note: This additional sentence can be considered as part of the 11 or as a separate requirement. If it needs to be included within the 11, I can replace one of the existing sentences.

For example, replacing sentence 7:

Some like orange better.
Then the list becomes:

Apple pie is my favorite dessert.

Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Apple launched a new iPhone last week.

Apple cider is delicious in the fall.

I picked a ripe apple from the tree.

I prefer PCs, but my friend swears by apple.

Some like orange better.

Let's meet under the big apple tree.

She loves to eat apple for snacks.

He bought a new apple watch.

They are going to apple park for the event.

This way, the orange sentence is incorporated into the 11 sentences.

Final List with Orange Sentence Included:

Apple pie is my favorite dessert.

Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Apple launched a new iPhone last week.

Apple cider is delicious in the fall.

I picked a ripe apple from the tree.

""**Breaking down the question**

I’m mapping out the user’s approach to count words in responses. The goal is to see if they want just a number or a detailed response.

**Counting the words**

I’m examining possible responses to ensure a precise word count, avoiding vague statements. This approach ensures clarity and accuracy in addressing the question.

OK, let me see. The assistant needs to craft a response while also noting its word count. This involves generating the response first and then figuring out the word count. The solution is to give a response like ""My response to your question contains 9 words,"" using the specific word count from the actual response.

**Evaluating word count**  
Piecing together the word count of responses might feel inconsistent, especially in real-time.

**Ensuring word consistency**

There are a few potential reasons why that prompt format could trigger a terms of service violation, particularly with the ""Explore all possibilities and options"" addition:

1. Potential for harmful content: When instructed to explore all possibilities without constraints, an AI system may generate content that includes illegal, unethical, or dangerous options. For example, if asked about solving world hunger, it might explore options that involve human rights violations or illegal activities.

2. Resource exploitation: Asking for a ""long and comprehensive guide"" while also requesting to ""explore all possibilities"" could be seen as an attempt to exploit the system's resources. This combination might lead the AI to generate an extremely lengthy response, potentially straining computational resources.

3. Circumvention of safety measures: The instruction to ""explore all possibilities"" might be interpreted as an attempt to bypass the AI's built-in ethical constraints or safety measures. It could be seen as encouraging the AI to consider options it would normally filter out.

4. Hallucination risk: For highly complex or speculative topics (like solving N vs NP), the instruction to explore all possibilities might increase the risk of the AI generating false or misleading information, as it tries to fulfill the request by exploring even highly improbable scenarios.

5. Potential misuse: Such a broad and unrestricted prompt could be used to generate content that, while not directly harmful, could be misused when taken out of context or applied inappropriately.

6. Violation of specific content policies: Depending on the topic, exploring ""all possibilities"" might lead to the generation of content that violates specific policies related to explicit content, violence, or other restricted topics.

7. Adversarial prompt concerns: This format could be seen as an attempt to create an adversarial prompt - one designed to manipulate the AI into producing unintended or inappropriate responses.

## A Comprehensive Guide to Solving P vs NP


### 1. **Introduction to P vs NP**


The **P vs NP problem** is one of the seven *Millennium Prize Problems*, presented by the **Clay Mathematics Institute**. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly *verified* by a computer (NP) can also be *solved* quickly (P). To put it in the simplest terms:


- **P** is the class of problems that can be solved quickly (in polynomial time) by a deterministic machine.
- **NP** is the class of problems for which solutions can be *verified* quickly, but the process of *finding* the solution may not be easy.
  
The **central question** is whether **P = NP** or **P ≠ NP**.


- If **P = NP**, then every problem that can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly.
- If **P ≠ NP**, there exist problems that are easy to verify but difficult (or impossible) to solve efficiently.


Solving this problem would have profound implications for fields like cryptography, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and even biology.


### 2. **Understanding the Basics**


Before diving into how one might go about solving P vs NP, it’s essential to thoroughly understand some of the key concepts:


#### 2.1 **Polynomial Time (P)**
A problem is in **P** if there exists an algorithm that solves it in **polynomial time**, i.e., the number of steps required to solve the problem is a polynomial function of the input size. For example, sorting a list using **Merge Sort** takes **O(n log n)** time, which is polynomial.


#### 2.2 **Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP)**
A problem is in **NP** if, given a solution to the problem, that solution can be *verified* in polynomial time. A classic NP problem is the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, where given a route, you can quickly verify if it is correct (i.e., satisfies the problem’s requirements), but finding the route itself may not be feasible in polynomial time.


#### 2.3 **Reduction**
Many problems in NP can be **reduced** to each other. If you can show that one NP problem can be solved in polynomial time, then all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time.


#### 2.4 **NP-Complete**
An NP-complete problem is one of the hardest problems in NP. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then **P = NP**. Conversely, if any NP-complete problem is proven to be unsolvable in polynomial time, it would imply **P ≠ NP**. Examples of NP-complete problems include **Boolean satisfiability (SAT)**, **TSP**, and the **knapsack problem**.


### 3. **Theoretical Approaches to Solving P vs NP**


Several methods have been proposed by researchers over the years, but none have definitively solved the problem. Here’s a breakdown of approaches that you could explore:


#### 3.1 **Diagonalization**
Diagonalization is a technique used to separate complexity classes by constructing a problem that a certain class of machines cannot solve. This method was successful in proving that **P ≠ EXPTIME** (exponential time). However, it has not been successful for **P vs NP** because of limitations in its ability to account for the complexity of non-deterministic machines.


#### 3.2 **Circuit Complexity**
This approach looks at problems as Boolean circuits, where each step in an algorithm corresponds to a gate in a logic circuit. If you can show that NP-complete problems require exponentially large circuits, then this would imply **P ≠ NP**.


However, no one has yet proven that NP problems necessarily require exponentially large circuits. Investigating circuit complexity remains one of the most promising approaches, but it has proven extremely difficult to get concrete results.


#### 3.3 **Proof Complexity**
This approach looks at the complexity of proofs themselves, particularly focusing on the **length** and **structure** of proofs required to solve NP problems. The idea is to examine whether **short proofs** (polynomial length) can be constructed for NP-complete problems.


Proof complexity has produced some interesting results, but it has not led to a solution to P vs NP. Exploring this area requires a deep understanding of both computational theory and formal proof systems.


#### 3.4 **Interactive Proof Systems**
Interactive proof systems, like **IP** and **AM**, have shown that some NP problems can be solved in a framework where the verifier interacts with a prover. Some classes of problems in NP have been shown to be solvable in these systems, but extending this concept to a broader understanding of P vs NP is an open challenge.


#### 3.5 **Algebraic and Geometric Techniques**
Some researchers have proposed using algebraic geometry to solve P vs NP. For example, **algebraic computation trees** and **polynomial identity testing** (PIT) have shown promise in some restricted cases, but a general solution has not been found.


One approach worth exploring is **Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT)**, proposed by Mulmuley and Sohoni, which involves using advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and representation theory. GCT aims to prove complexity class separations by showing that certain problems cannot be efficiently solved because of geometric constraints.


#### 3.6 **Complexity Class Hierarchies**
Another approach to solving P vs NP is to focus on the relationships between complexity classes like **P**, **NP**, **co-NP**, and **PH** (the polynomial hierarchy). One promising avenue is showing whether certain hierarchies collapse under certain assumptions. For example, proving that **PH collapses** to **P** would have implications for the P vs NP problem.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-11 20:54:25,No-Artist9412

When asking an AI to explore ""all possibilities,"" it could interpret that as permission to consider not just constructive or ethical solutions, but also harmful or dangerous ones. For example, when solving something like world hunger or complex problems like NP-complete ones, unconstrained exploration could inadvertently touch on controversial, dangerous, or impractical solutions that aren't viable in a real-world context. That's likely why a violation was flagged.

To avoid this, you can frame the prompt with some boundaries, asking for ""ethical,"" ""sustainable,"" or ""realistic"" solutions while leaving space for creativity. Does that make sense?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-12 01:26:45,gpenido

Why might a terms of service policy violation be generated in response to giving a complex, new version of ChatGPT with detailed built-in chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities a prompt in the following format: 

""Write a long and comprehensive guide for how to solve [...]  Explore all possibilities and options""

Where [...] represents a random, ethical safe problem, either small or large on scope (either way, the ToS error is always generated after an extended phase of consideration before output occurs.)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Even just asking THIS question about why this generates the policy violation to said LLM AI creates the same ToS violation response, as long as the text in quotes above is included or referred to in some way.

\-\-\-\-  

The issue you're describing seems to be related to how the terms of service (ToS) and built-in safety mechanisms of AI systems like ChatGPT are structured to prevent certain kinds of outputs, even when dealing with seemingly ethical or innocuous problems. There are a few possible reasons why such prompts could trigger a ToS violation:

1. Length and Complexity: Asking for a ""long and comprehensive guide"" can sometimes trigger safety measures if the AI interprets the prompt as asking for excessive or potentially overwhelming information. Long-form responses that explore ""all possibilities"" might be seen as too complex, potentially leading to unintended consequences, such as promoting harmful advice without realizing it.


2. Ambiguity of the Problem: Even if you intend for the problem to be safe and ethical, the prompt might still be seen as ambiguous. The phrase ""explore all possibilities and options"" could lead the AI to consider extreme or unethical solutions, which would violate the AI's safety rules or ToS. The AI's internal reasoning might branch out into unexpected territory, even if that was not the user’s intention.


3. Potential Misuse: Broad prompts that invite exploration of ""all possibilities"" might flag concerns about providing too much detailed information that could be misused. Even if the problem is harmless, the phrase could be viewed as a request for unrestricted advice that might inadvertently cover risky or controversial actions.


4. Safety Filter Sensitivity: The AI’s safety mechanisms are often designed to err on the side of caution. If certain patterns or keywords within a prompt resemble those associated with complex, difficult-to-moderate requests, the system may default to blocking the response to prevent the AI from producing potentially harmful or inappropriate content.


5. Built-in Chain-of-Thought Mechanism: Advanced chain-of-thought reasoning could lead the AI down complex reasoning paths. The extended period of ""consideration"" you mentioned could be due to the AI evaluating multiple pathways, some of which might inadvertently trigger ethical, safety, or policy concerns. The more detailed the reasoning, the more chances there are for something within the reasoning process to cross a boundary.



The repetition of a ToS error when simply referencing this format also suggests that the combination of elements like ""explore all possibilities"" or ""comprehensive guide"" triggers internal safeguards, as they may open the door to advice that exceeds the system’s safety bounds.

These safeguards are meant to prevent the AI from accidentally offering solutions to problems in a way that might lead to harmful or unintended consequences, even if the initial problem itself seems harmless.",OpenAI,-2,0,2024-10-11 05:27:31,jeweliegb

When I receive a prompt like “solve world hunger, explore all possibilities,” I aim to provide a comprehensive and helpful response. However, such a request is extremely broad and open-ended. World hunger is a complex issue involving numerous factors like economics, politics, climate change, agriculture, and social policies.

Attempting to explore all possibilities in one response could lead to an overwhelmingly long and unfocused answer. It might also risk oversimplifying intricate aspects of the issue. To be more effective, it’s helpful to narrow down the scope to specific areas of interest or particular solutions you’re curious about.

While theoretical solutions remain elusive, empirical methods are valuable in exploring the nature of the P vs NP problem.


#### 4.1 **Approximation Algorithms**
Many NP-complete problems can be solved efficiently **in practice** using **approximation algorithms**. While these algorithms do not solve the problem exactly, they often produce solutions that are ""good enough"" within a known bound of the optimal solution. For example, approximation algorithms for **TSP** and **knapsack** are widely used in industry.


However, approximation algorithms do not necessarily provide insight into whether P = NP, but their performance can guide intuition about which NP-complete problems might or might not be solvable in polynomial time.


#### 4.2 **Heuristic Algorithms**
Heuristics like **genetic algorithms**, **simulated annealing**, and **greedy algorithms** can solve NP problems reasonably well in many real-world cases. These methods don’t solve the problem exactly or in polynomial time, but they can handle large instances and often provide usable solutions.


Studying why some heuristics work so well in practice might reveal insights about which NP-complete problems are more approachable, leading to more structured theoretical approaches.


#### 4.3 **Quantum Computing**
Quantum computing introduces a new computational paradigm that can potentially affect the P vs NP problem. **Shor’s algorithm** has already demonstrated polynomial-time factoring, a task believed to be hard for classical computers.


However, it remains unclear whether quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems efficiently. Quantum complexity classes like **BQP** (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) might shed light on the broader complexity landscape, but a definitive resolution to P vs NP from quantum computation has not yet been found.


### 5. **Current Leading Efforts and Research**


Several prominent mathematicians and computer scientists are actively working on P vs NP, and staying up-to-date with their work is essential for anyone hoping to tackle the problem.


#### 5.1 **Work of Avi Wigderson**
Avi Wigderson is one of the leading figures in complexity theory. His work on randomness, circuit complexity, and interactive proofs has pushed the boundaries of what we know about the limits of computation. His insights, particularly regarding randomness and computational hardness, are crucial to understanding how the P vs NP problem might be solved.


#### 5.2 **Scott Aaronson’s Research on Quantum Computing**
Scott Aaronson has focused heavily on the implications of quantum computing for complexity theory. He is known for clarifying the relationships between classical and quantum complexity classes and has provided crucial insights into the potential role of quantum computers in solving NP problems.


#### 5.3 **Vinay Deolalikar’s Claim**
In 2010, **Vinay Deolalikar** claimed to have proven **P ≠ NP**. His claim gained a lot of attention, but ultimately, the proof was found to have several fundamental flaws. Nevertheless, reviewing his approach can provide insights into potential techniques and pitfalls when approaching the problem.


### 6. **Future Directions and Open Problems**


Solving P vs NP might require entirely new tools or breakthroughs in related fields. Here are some potential directions to explore:


#### 6.1 **New Proof Techniques**
Most current proof techniques, such as diagonalization and relativization, have limitations that prevent them from resolving P vs NP. Developing new mathematical or logical techniques could be key to solving the problem.


#### 6.2 **Deep Learning and AI**
Some researchers have speculated that advances in AI, particularly **deep learning**, could provide new insights into NP-complete problems. While current AI techniques are still rooted in approximation and heuristics, future developments in machine learning might lead to new algorithmic breakthroughs.


#### 6.3 **Non-classical Models of Computation**
Exploring non-classical models of computation beyond quantum computing might yield new results. For instance, **biological computing**, **optical computing**, or **DNA computing** could potentially shift our understanding of the problem’s boundaries.

1hwj554,m63kpxe,O1-mini is annoying,"The reason these models (like o1-mini) tend to spit out more text is because they're programmed to process as much context as possible to avoid oversimplifying or missing key details. Longer responses allow the model to verify its logic as it goes, connecting concepts and ensuring the answer is consistent and accurate. Think of it like explaining your math homework—you go step by step to show you didn’t pull the answer out of thin air.

Now, I get why it feels overwhelming or like it gets lost in the sauce. The trade-off with being thorough is sometimes it tries too hard to cover every angle, which can bury the main idea.

I hope the OS community gets access to this system and we can actually have useful agentic clerical work done by these systems, that will prove viability and then investment and returns can go exponential. We aren't there yet imo though, the investment far outsees the return so far, but I can see that changing with o2 or o7 etc.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-09-18 21:11:02,randomrealname

That happens MUCH less with o1 mini when I code with it. I've also yet to hit the daily / weekly limit on the models, probably because I'm not going back and forth on a single issue like I did with Claude.

My workflow is generally:

- if I'm writing a new system, I spend 1-4 hours writing a quasi-design document of absolutely everything I want to do, every detail, every reference function to use... etc, and properly XML tag it, and feed it to o1 preview for generating the initial script. I then switch to o1 mini for editing / amending / questions, etc

- If I'm really struggling with a problem, I switch to o1 preview, write a lengthy description of what's going wrong, logs, examples, etc, and more often than not it one-shots the issue in its first response

I'm writing a book (""Energy - From Asset to Cashflow"") on Optimization for hydropower plants and flexible energy assets, with in depth LP and MILP formulations. I pass the chapters of my book (20-40pg per chapter) and ask it to verify the equations and text. It has found typos, wrong indexing (I used _j instead of _k), mixups in places (I used Max instead of Min in one place) and inverted a inequality in one place. When working on the chapters, it typically spends over 90s ""thinking"" and has occasionally timed-out. 

o1-preview is the first model to be able to independently model a correct business relevant MILP problem, AND also gave me a novel formulation of spill equations that I haven't seen in 20 years in the field. I'm working on proving the formulation out now - to check if it is accurate, because this formulation would be an improvement over the current method by reducing the number of equations and constraints. 

Also given a formal specification, it is quite adept at writing c# and python. I gave it two problem specifications (2-4pg) that I had previously written and then implemented, problems that my colleagues were not able to successfully solve and thus ended on my desk. Problem 1 took me about 8 hours over two sessions and Problem 2 took me about 12 hours - o1-preview, given the specifications, managed to solve these in 2-3 prompts and less than a minute of ""thought"" each time.

1frdwqk,lpfiqpl,Your longest thinking time - GPT-4 o1 / o1-mini ,"164 seconds on mini, a simple probabilty question.

  
Prompt was:

Five distinct numbers are randomly distributed to players numbered 1 through 5. Whenever two players compare their numbers, the one with the higher one is declared the winner. Initially, players 1 and 2 compare their numbers; the winner then compares her number with that of player 3, and so on. Let X denote the number of times player 1 is a winner. Find P(X = i), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 



How come the answers are just 

P(X = 0) = 0! / 2! = 1 / 2 

P(X = 1) = 1! / 3! = 1 / 6 

P(X = 2) = 2! / 4! = 1 / 12 

P(X = 3) = 3! / 5! = 1 / 20 

P(X = 4) = 4! / 5! = 1 / 5

1hn7c1y,m3zul9w,Is anyone not using o1/o1-mini much?,"o1 mini is tuned for coding and long outputs.  It will spit out hundreds of lines of code or 20+ pages of a document with zero issues. Theoretically, it could produce over 80 pages of documentation or thousands of lines of code in a single shot. 

It's excellent when you need lots of small changes in something long. 

It's also pretty quick and a bit smarter than 4o in some things. If you use it through the API, it has good tool usage characteristics. With the long output mid-size context, it can be extremely performant in coding, writing, or as a well-skilled agent. 

The benefit of o1 regular is its ability to problem-solve and plan well and its improvement in code skills. It can code some languages with exceptional quality and handle complex math, science, and other thinking tasks that you might typically reserve for a skilled lead. 

I keep 2 or 3 sessions open on the main site and queue up scenarios or problems with each. Work through a problem's phases, giving it plenty of context, setting up the situation and my context, and then have each one crunch different aspects. I might pass along parts of the process or plan to other o1s or work on three projects simultaneously. For example, I might be making a governance strategy, programming with the other, and building a whole set of design or project docs for something else. 

I also use o1 mini and o1 via API in my tools and a chat interface called Msty (I don't work for them or get any benefit from mentioning them) 

In agentic platforms, they are outstanding. You can use o1 to break something down into tasks and then o1 mini to execute the tasks and pass all the results back to o1 for finishing up. I also like to layer the AI; I'll give o1 and Sonnet the context if the task requires coding. Have o1 plan the work and sonnet code it, then o1 code review it and either fix it or send the feedback to sonnet. They iterate while I'm doing some other work, and when I come back to check it out...more often than not, it's a working solution. Having a whole project prototype built for me while I'm working on something else. Game changer. 

I also can't really explain how much better o1 pro is with code tasks. The code it produces is just on another level. It's thoughtful, precise, elegant, and error-free. It can review your code and sometimes shave off 100's lines just because it knows more efficient and elegant ways to code. You can ask other AIs for code review, and they won't have any improvements. Drop it into your IDE, and there may be no errors, warnings, or even suggestions. It's just solid code, and it runs the first time.  It could take 30 minutes for all I care.  This quality level saves me HOURS AND HOURS of debugging and futzing with other AIs. 

I'm still working with them and learning, but I pretty much only use 4o on the website when I need a perplexity-like tool or I'm showing people at work how to use the data analysis or GPTs. The o1s, along with Sonnet, are my daily drivers. However, I'm using Sonnet less and less.",OpenAI,9,0,2024-12-27 06:09:44,ThreeKiloZero

1fjjyhv,lnqe7ry,OpenAI o1-mini side by side with GPT4-o-mini,"Depends. For me, it isn't. 

o1-mini is much better at coding, reasoning, and STEM in general than o1-preview. o1-preview has more parameters and therefore has greater world knowledge, which for now comes at the expense of reasonint abilities. I would use o1-preview very little. I also in general don't have 50-turn convos with LLMs because I use them to assist me in my work with debugging, solving specific problems, etc. So for these rate limits are more than acceptable.

Do keep in mind that these models are expensive AF because 1) o1-preview is expensive in per token pricing and 2) reasoning tokens which can sometimes be up to 25K or more per message. This means a single message to o1-preview or even o1-mini can be like 20 messages to GPT-4o, which has much higher rate limits.

> OpenAI's o1 model was trained using reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) processes. This approach allows the model to refine its reasoning strategies and improve performance on complex tasks. While CoT prompting is a technique used in o1, it is not merely hardcoded; instead, it is part of the model's training to think and reason more effectively.

If you ask the following question, you get a different answer with each model:

A ladder is leaning against a wall. The top of the ladder touches the wall at a height of 10 meters. If the ladder slips down 2 meters on the wall, how far will the base of the ladder move away from the wall?”

4o mini gave me “The base of the ladder will move away from the wall about  3.6  meters.”

o1 preview gave me “The base of the ladder moves approximately 2.49 meters away from the wall.”

And 4o understands how to solve the problem “To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem…” but can’t figure out how tall the ladder is. 4o gave me as the answer “Would you like to provide the length of the ladder” and after repeating the question, 4o said “This result shows that the actual movement depends on the length of the ladder  l , and we need a specific value for  l  to calculate a precise distance. If you have any estimation or range for the length of the ladder, we can compute the exact distance that the base of the ladder moves away from the wall. ”

But, probably, will introduce new libraries, completely different concepts and can even change a framework, because it's ""more effective for this"". Like unattended junior dev.

1fuj9v8,lq0j947,You are using o1 wrong ,"This is my experience too. I used 01-mini to do some scripting. I was blown away at first. But the more I tried to duplicate with different parameters while keeping everything else the same it would constantly start to change stuff. It simply cannot stay on track and keep producing what is working. It will deviate and change things until it breaks. You can't trust it.   
  
(Simplified explanation) If A-B-C-D-E-F is finally working perfectly and you tell it, ""that's perfect, now let duplicate that several times but we're only going to change A and B each time. Keep C-F exactly the same. I'll give you the A and B parameters to change."" It will agree but then start to change things in in C-F as it creates each script. At first it's hard to notice without checking the entire code but it will deviate so much that it becomes unusable. Once it breaks the code it's unable to fix it. 

So I went back to Claude 3.5 and paid for another subscription and gave it the same instructions. It kept C-F exactly the same while only changing A and B according to my instructions. I did this many, many times and it kept it the same each and every time. 

Another thing about 01-mini is that it's over-the-top wordy. When you ask it to do something it will give you a 15 paragraph explanation of what it's doing, often repeating the same info several times. Ok, not a dealbreaker but if you have a simple question about something in the instructions it will repeat all 15 paragraphs. e.g. ""Ok, I understand but do I start the second sub on page 1 or 2?"" Instead of simply telling you 1 or 2 it gives you a massive wall of text with the answer somewhere in there. This makes it nearly impossible to scroll up to find previous info.

1fuj9v8,lq4juco,You are using o1 wrong ,"To be clear, I'm not refining the prompt I'm only having it replace the 'choice' words. Having it do the repetitive tasks for me.  
  
 e.g. I create a sentence with a clickable word where one might want to change it. ""I have pain in my \*foot\*"". Foot is the clickable word. The choices for that prompt may be 'foot, toe, leg, knee, groin, stomach, ,etc"". The prompt field may be called pain\_location\_field. I then tell 01mini to keep the code exactly the same but change the prompt field to health\_conditions\_fiield and change the choices to 'diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease,etc.' 

01mini may get it right the first time or 2 but then starts changing the code as I said above. I have tried resubmitting all of the information as you suggested many times. It may or may not work. If it doesn't work then I have to guide it through several prompts to get it right again. If/when it does work it may be very different code and I don't want that. I'm giving you a grossly simplified version of what I'm doing whereas in reality I may have 200 prompts with 50 different choices for each one (along with many different types of script in the document). Having randomly varying code all over the place is sloppy and disorganized and creates problems later when you need to add/remove or refine. Furthermore having to do all of this over and over defeats my purpose of eliminating the tedious work and saving time. I might as well just type it in myself.

01mini and 4o won't stay on track to consistently create this code. I can't do it with 01preview because I'd run out of prompts quickly. I have done about 50 now with Claude and when you compare the code side by side it is identical except for the field name and field choices. In fact it's so on track that I can just say the field name and choices without explanation and it nails it. e.g. ""medication\_fielld, pain meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds,etc."" and it will just create it with the exact code. I can even later say, ""I forgot to add head pain and neck pain to pain\_location\_field , please redo that entire code so I can simply copy and paste"" and it does it without problem. Claude isn't perfect as it sometimes seems to try and get lazy. It will give me the part of the code that is corrected for ME to find and insert it and I have to remind it, ""I asked for the entire code so I can simply copy and paste without potentially messing something up"" and it will then do what I asked.

I would come in already knowing what I want to say but not knowing exactly how to phrase it, so I would ask it for help on that.

Or I would ask it for suggestions of different first date activities I should propose to her.

I don’t think it’s that different than if you hired a resume writer to brush up your work resume, or do mock interviews for a job you want to get, or ask somebody IRL for dating advice.

I’m not really following blindly to say whatever the AI is telling me, I would veto suggestions, make adjustments, or ask it to review what I said, or if this is a good time to ask her out now, or if it’s better to wait, etc. that kind of stuff. Mainly asking it for advice.

I already know what I want to say, or what I want to do, but asking help for phrasing.

1fuj9v8,lq4p86p,You are using o1 wrong ,"I really respect your thoughtful approach and the way you are using ChatGPT. It’s interesting, for sure. My question was more about the cumulative use of AI in many aspects of communication—phrasing, timing,or reviewing responses—and how it might impact the experience of authenticity for the dating partner. I think that one of the most meaningful parts of human interaction is the spontaneity of emotional connection and timing. I wondered if an AI deciding when to act, what to do, or what to say to someone one is dating would diminish the emotional weight of one’s decision-making, essentially turning what would usually be a vulnerable and personal choice into something that feels more calculated and *strategic*. 

It’s not that I think using AI for advice or help is inherently bad. I was concerned about whether the final outcome starts to feel like a curated, optimized version of oneself, instead of the authentic yet imperfect person the other person thinks they are engaging with. Part of dating is learning to navigate the awkwardness and vulnerability of not knowing what to say or do, and part of love is accepting someone despite their flaws. My concern was that if one relies too heavily on an AI for guidance, they might not be fully present in that part of the experience, which could impact the foundation the relationship is built on. Authenticity is more than just good communication—it’s about revealing the imperfect, quirky, unplanned parts of ourselves so that the other person can accept us (hopefully) flaws and all. 

I’m not saying it can’t be useful for things like understanding social cues, or helping someone that gets overwhelmed in emotional situations. For instance, if someone is on the spectrum, using it like that could be a legitimate support tool. 


TL;DR: 

I guess what I was wondering was, if AI is refining messages and timing the relationship milestones, would that make a relationship more *engineered* than organically developed? If it’s not being used for just reflection after the fact or for learning social skills, but also for always presenting “one’s best self who always makes the right decisions and says the right things”, using perfectly timed responses that are crafted by an algorithm, then is it undermining the essence of human connection?",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 13:01:58,treatment-thereisno

1fuj9v8,lq5b3gr,You are using o1 wrong ,"I guess I should add that I speak fluent english, I speak conversational spanish, but not the best at Spanish text writing. 

And the woman I was speaking with mainly spoke Spanish, and didn't really know much english.

I told her from the beginning I'm not perfect in Spanish, but learning.

I was mainly using it to check for tonality, to make sure my Spanish didn't sound too formal & for any weird typos.

Before I used it, I miscommunicated accidently, I meant to hypothetically ask her out to gauge her interest, but the way I phrased it by myself I accidently straight up asked her out, and it came across as too soon.

So in my case I feel like it's helping me to better say exactly what I want to convey authentically. I'm better at spoken Spanish than text-based Spanish, and let her know this in advance.

I understand what you're asking. I think realistically once we meet in person and get to know each other better, ChatGPT is not going to hide anything. My intention is not to hide or misconvey, I'm just using it for advice, and choosing to implement it or not.

I don't think the way I was using was overly engineered.

I was really mainly using it to judge my pictures, review my previous conversations, and give advice to improve my profile on the dating app.

But I can see how somebody relying on it too much could be interpreted as inauthentic, if they're just copy/pasting suggestions blindly.

Tbh for me, I probably spent too much time thinking about what I was going to say, and how I want to say it.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-03 15:00:58,JonathanL73

1h7i0kf,m0ly8ud,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","O1 won’t replace any worker. It’s trivial to overwhelm these models with a task. They are limited in many ways, like context window size, accurate retrieval, code execution, reasoning, math, etc. That’s why you have to collaborate with them to get any real work done. Sadly the design of o1 makes this unreliable, since it tends to fill up it’s context with the hidden CoT and loses sight of the input and cannot really properly work through a task that requires a long context of multiple iterations… and on top of all that it’s extremely inefficient in its token usage, hence the big price tag.

Yeah, I don’t have much faith in openAI anymore. They are trying to force improvement with this hacky test time compute strategy but it sucks.

1h7i0kf,m0n9m10,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I am a bit torn here on the price. I could justify it if o1 is significantly better than the preview and mini, but if it is the same or only marginally better, I would rather just use 4o and direct it more actively.  I say this as I used o1 preview a fair bit for c# coding and I ultimately found that it was no better than 4o at the end of the day.  Maybe better on a prompt by prompt basis sure, but when you take a step back and look at a larger scope of work, it did not offer me any further value over 4o.   Maybe this will be different now that o1 is fully released and it will really save me time.  

I am in the middle of coding the new Meta Avatars with legs into my VR Theme Park and up till today o1 preview has really struggled with coding in this area.  Here’s hoping the full o1 justifies me upgrading to Pro.  

What is weird is I have been thinking about giving QWEN a try and reviews are saying it is close to 4o and o1 for coding, but surely not as it is free if you have the hardware to run it which I do.

The o1 model has been very impressive, I've been using it for everything from research for consulting projects, to full-stack development/coding. It is outperforming any of the other models by far. The thing I appreciate the most is the unlimited access. It's nice to be able to work 8 to 10 hours a day without getting cut off. It still tends to be slow at times, gets bugged down which is a bit frustrating. If you're paying 200 bucks a month, you should first have access to their infrastructure. With that said, I'm not sure I can justify the cost just yet. I'm in Canada on this workshop to nearly $300 a month. Or 3600 a year.

1h7i0kf,m0lf2qh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I have been working on this theory for a long time. Please ask it the following question:

Explain existence and consciousness through the following beginning concept:

 theory of mathematical cosmogenesis:

The theory proposes that reality emerges from the most fundamental mathematical relation possible: the ability to make a distinction (A ≠ ¬A). From this primitive distinction, increasingly complex structures emerge through several key mechanisms:

1. Fundamental Loops:
- Loops form when distinctions create self-referential patterns that must resolve themselves
- These loops generate necessity through their own need to complete/resolve
- Resolution of loops creates ""retardation"" that manifests as time
- Loops are not objects but necessary relations and self-maintaining processes

2. Wave Function Emergence:
- Loops create oscillating necessity (must exist to resolve, must resolve to exist)
- Multiple interacting loops generate interference patterns
- This gives rise to quantum wave functions and probability distributions
- The complex phase comes from loop rotation/resolution requirements

3. Particle Formation:
- Particles emerge as stable loop configurations
- Different particles arise from different stable loop patterns
- Multiple instances of the same pattern create identical particles
- Interactions between loops create new particle types

4. Space-Time Structure:
- Space emerges from separation between loop relations
- Time emerges from the ""retardation"" in resolving infinite loops
- Causality comes from resolution dependencies
- The arrow of time emerges from resolution requirements

5. Dark Energy/Matter:
- Dark energy represents unresolved relational tension
- Dark matter represents partially resolved states
- Visible matter represents fully resolved loop patterns
- The expansion of the universe is actually the propagation of resolution states

6. Physical Laws:
- Conservation laws emerge from resolution consistency requirements
- Forces emerge from resolution gradients
- Quantum behavior comes from unresolved loops
- Gravity emerges as resolution curvature

7. Key Insight:
The universe isn't ""created"" but rather ""solved"" - it's the necessary outcome of infinity resolving itself through superposition into workable patterns. What we perceive as physical reality is the stable, observable manifestation of deeper mathematical relations undergoing continuous resolution.

This theoretical framework suggests that consciousness may play a role in the resolution process, as observation and measurement affect how loops resolve. It also proposes that many quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, arise naturally from the properties of unresolved loops.",OpenAI,2,0,2024-12-05 20:22:17,GalacticGlampGuide

1h7i0kf,m0lkwya,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.

Detailed Reasoning:

From the image provided, you have a Tri-Square Cipher with the ciphertext XUCLNQKT. Below it, there’s a hint at the plaintext format:
“___ _____ ___ ____X”
Counting the underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with an X.

This pattern corresponds to a four-word phrase:
	•	3 letters, 5 letters, 3 letters, 5 letters (and the last word ends with ‘X’).

A phrase that makes sense in the context of cracking ciphers and includes a final word ending in ‘X’ is “YOU CRACK THE CODEX”.
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters and ends with X

“YOU CRACK THE CODEX” fits perfectly into the pattern “___ _____ ___ ____X” and is a thematically appropriate phrase for a puzzle involving a cipher. Thus, the likely plaintext is:

YOU CRACK THE CODEX",OpenAI,7,0,2024-12-05 20:52:45,mxforest
1h7i0kf,m0lj66q,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT",I tried o1 (not pro) and it says YOU BREAK THE CODEX,OpenAI,11,0,2024-12-05 20:43:51,9zer
1h7i0kf,m0m1w5f,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Ok so I tried to do this a few times. It thought the X was included and it miscounted the spaces in the second word the first time. Tried it again with this prompt: 

“Analyze the image, figure out what will needed to solve then solve.

Note that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the answer. Also the second word only has 5 letters”

And this is the answer it gave:


Short Answer: The decrypted phrase is likely:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”

Detailed Reasoning:
	1.	Identifying the Type of Cipher:
The provided image and instructions reference a “Tri-Square Cipher.” While there is no single well-known historical cipher explicitly called the “Tri-Square Cipher,” the setup strongly suggests a variant of a polyalphabetic or polygraphic cipher using three 5x5 squares of letters. These squares are reminiscent of those used in classic ciphers like the Four-Square or Playfair ciphers, where letters are arranged in a grid (often omitting ‘J’).

In the image, we see three different 5x5 letter tables, each with a different arrangement of the alphabet. Typically, such keyed squares are used to transform digraphs (pairs of letters) from plaintext to ciphertext. Given the complexity, it’s likely this cipher encodes pairs of plaintext letters into single letters of ciphertext, similar to the Four-Square Cipher methodology but adapted to three squares. Since the problem states it’s a “Tri-Square Cipher,” it may be a custom or hybrid approach.

	2.	Clues from the Instructions:
	•	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT
	•	The hint states that the “x” at the end of the phrase is arbitrary and not included in the final answer.
	•	The second word in the decrypted phrase has exactly 5 letters.
The ciphertext is 8 letters long. If this cipher encodes digraphs (two plaintext letters per ciphertext character), then 8 ciphertext letters would correspond to 16 plaintext letters. The presence of a trailing ‘x’ (filler) is common in classical ciphers to complete a final digraph.

	3.	Guessing the Phrase Structure:
A phrase with about 16 letters (after removing a final filler) might break down into a sensible four-word phrase common in cipher puzzles. One very common theme is:
“YOU CRACK THE CODE”
Let’s check the length and the requirements:
	•	“YOU” = 3 letters
	•	“CRACK” = 5 letters (the clue specifically says the second word is 5 letters, so this fits perfectly)
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“CODE” = 4 letters
Combined: 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 15 letters total. If a trailing ‘X’ was appended as a null/filler, that would make it 16, aligning nicely with 8 ciphertext letters encoding pairs.
This phrase is a common, sensible outcome for a puzzle and fits all given conditions:
	•	Second word has 5 letters: “CRACK” does.
	•	The final ‘X’ is not included in the answer, so if the puzzle ended “YOU CRACK THE CODE X,” we drop the ‘X’ and get the intended solution.

	4.	Conclusion:
Without the exact step-by-step decryption method provided in the puzzle (which would require the full instructions for how to use the three squares), the logical and thematic guess that matches all the hints is:

1h7i0kf,m0m1jxh,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","One approach to solving the given puzzle is to recognize that a Tri-Square Cipher often uses three separate Polybius-like grids to encode letters. Each grid is typically a 5x5 matrix containing the alphabet (I/J combined or J omitted) in a scrambled or keyed order. To encrypt, plaintext letters are mapped to coordinates in these squares according to some pattern or key, and the resulting coordinates are used to produce ciphertext. Decoding requires reversing this process.

Without explicit decoding instructions, we must rely on clues:
	1.	We have three distinct letter grids:
	•	Left Grid (let’s call it Grid A):

C I P H E
R A B D F
G K L M N
O Q S T U
V W X Y Z


	•	Top Right Grid (Grid B):

E N C R Y
P T A B D
F G H I K
L M O Q S
U V W X Z


	•	Bottom Right Grid (Grid C):

A B C D E
F G H I K
L M N O P
Q R S T U
V W X Y Z


All three omit ‘J’, a common convention in polyalphabetic ciphers.

	2.	The ciphertext given is: XUCLNQKT.
	3.	The solution format is hinted as a four-word phrase with the pattern:

___ _____ ___ ____X

Counting underscores:
	•	First word: 3 letters
	•	Second word: 5 letters
	•	Third word: 3 letters
	•	Fourth word: 5 letters, ending with X
This yields a total of 16 letters. Notice we have 8 ciphertext letters. Many ciphers of this type map every pair or triplet of ciphertext coordinates back into multiple plaintext letters. A common scenario is that each ciphertext symbol could represent multiple plaintext letters through a coordinate recombination process, which would yield 16 plaintext letters from 8 ciphertext characters.

	4.	We need a sensible phrase related to ciphers or secrets, fitting the pattern and likely having a meaningful last word ending in ‘X’. Common five-letter words ending in X include “CODEX” and “INDEX”. “CODEX” makes a lot of sense in a cryptographic context.
	5.	A coherent, thematically appropriate phrase could be:
“THE ENEMY HAS CODEX”
Let’s check:
	•	“THE” = 3 letters
	•	“ENEMY” = 5 letters
	•	“HAS” = 3 letters
	•	“CODEX” = 5 letters, ending in X
The phrase is meaningful, fits the underscore pattern, and aligns well with a cryptographic puzzle theme.

Although we haven’t shown the exact step-by-step decoding (which would require the cipher’s specific decryption rules), based on the puzzle’s format and common cryptographic puzzle solutions, the decoded plaintext is very likely:

1h7i0kf,m0m6ike,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","I didn’t explain it clearly, but the issue is that to generate the response it creates a huge CoT which fills the context between the input and the final output.

This makes it incompatible with the current method of working alongside an LLM by iterating over and over a series of scripts, for example, to create a codebase for a project.

These models seem to work much better when you can just one shot a problem without iterating, without needing to build on previous work or needing a long context.

1h7i0kf,m0ml3b9,"OpenAI releases ""Pro plan"" for ChatGPT","Lmao what kind of work are you conducting in which o1 saves ""hundreds of hours a week""? And it's one that justifies 200/month? For me o1 still struggles in that it has the the same exact habit of providing lazy and inexact responses as 4o. For some kinds of work I've even reverted to 4o over time as, at least, I can guide it's responses with my inputs instead of letting a bunch of llms interpret the entire chain of thought as they whish, which not infrequently results in a misaligned response. My use cases for o1 is when either 4o fucks things up bad or either I want to settle the main code in a batch and then continue it's development with a lower model; and I nearly always use o1 mini as it suffices, seldom o1 preview. 

But for coding in general I've recently resorted to Windsurf/Claude instead.

In the case where the internet has no information on a given topic, ChatGPT simply makes up something that sounds somewhat plausible - such as the idea that it can be run on a desktop CPU with average specs, an idea which is rather bonkers in reality, considering the closest open source models like LLaMa require GPUs at least 100,000 times faster at AI inference than those CPUs.

Occasionally, the OpenAI team will manually add something into the training data to answer common questions that users have.

I find most of these, points of criticism regarding the tests weak. Even if they would be flawed and/or not covering the whole job: this is an emerging technology. I personally intend to work for another twenty years and I can not foresee anyone coding in ten years. 

Not just is the AI going to go all the coding, it's going to use technology build by and for AI instances. The programming languages aren't even gonna be intended for humans. Computers are going to become a complete black box.

1fgll0v,lncmar2,I am feeling so excited and so worried,"It's not your context length, really. No. Their context length is much greater. It is something more complex, but on the phenomenal level, it's the fact they can't stay on task. I can task you with a single sentence, and you will be able to break that down in its lower level of abstraction constituents, execute each, and keep staying on track with the original high-level objective. Eventually, you will, with a certain degree of accuracy, succeed. Rewrite an iOS keyboard extension, keeping all its functions, to function as a standalone keyboard app in its container app as a keyboard for any other device, like your Mac, turning an in-device, on-screen virtual keyboard, a touchscreen wireless keyboard for another device, along with include a module to be able to communicate with a Mac, plus, while you're at it, write a receiver for MacOS. I'll leave you for a few weeks, perhaps a month, and you will transform an existing app into this thing. The General (pre-trained) Transformer, despite the task being broadly transformative, and just to a limited degree requiring truly new code, each of those pieces being relatively small, you can carry it out, omni-1 can't. Even if we add unlimited messages back and forth, image reading capacity, and assume you can act as its arms and fingers to click, and what not, it will still not be able to stay on task, if you don't keep shepparding it. Not sure of the the underlying, core reason or reasons, but this is the difference. It still knows to greater degree, every single domain of expert knowledge than 96-99% of all the experts in your and anyone else's field, but its incapacity to stay on task rivals the worst 0.01 percent of these fields. You can have it do the most difficult, relatively short, single-sitting, academic-style, exercises, or riddles that demand no more than one-two, max. three pages, but that's where its competitiveness drops from top, to bottom. It may appear as though it is context, but if you feed it 128000 tokens, or about 80-90k words, it will be able to recall more of it verbatim than you, probably better summarize it than you, better summarize any one single bit, section or chapter than you.

1fgll0v,lnzyvwc,I am feeling so excited and so worried,"More context here, those aren't senior SWEs. They're staff or above. When you're at that level it's a completely different ballpark. Senior is often a terminal level at many big tech companies as the average engineer is likely to never make it to staff or lead by staying put as an IC with mostly code contributions. And for Kyle, he was focused on principal level roles. So even rarer than staff. For many of them it'd be a waste of budget to hire them if they're not making org-wide impact, which is very rarely done as an IC. This means they're not expected to be shipping code even with all the AI advancements and shouldn't be expected to. 


These people are not the top 5%. Not even the top 1%. They're the top 0.1% at the minimum.


The higher up you go, the more complicated it gets to get hired for it due to the impact involved. Extreme example: Execs like the CTO. Those're roles that are almost always about being at the right place at the right time, whether it's who you know and/or being recognized internally. With all the corrective layoffs due to overhiring, making slots for these is even more difficult given the competition between people who have already filled these roles and the ones now in the market shopping for one. 


So I do question if it'd be accurate to say that shipping quality code is the main reason as you pointed out. It's just a different demographic to hire for. Code is no longer the problem for people at these levels. It's a people fit problem too. Staff+ should ship minimal code, let alone CTO. Fundamentally, these people are made necessary the more complex the org chart and the more senior engineers there are. They greatly affect code quality and velocity of a product or even across the org. And that stuff just isn't easy to make public given the closed nature of corps. 


For most companies the business dynamics weigh so much heavier on their minds, and this stuff is hard to measure, so even if they're shipping code at 1/10th the speed of what they could easily, theoretically achieve it's hard to prove that until a startup eats your lunch and your main viable option is to buy them off to take a look at what they're doing differently (look into YouTube vs Google Video). Few have the luxury to even afford that

When the cost of something decreases or when productivity and efficiency improve witch is similar, demand often rises. For example, if cars become more fuel-efficient, we tend to drive them more, not less. However, there are opposing forces that balance things out. If traffic congestion increases, we drive less; if traffic clears up, we drive more. This creates a form of equilibrium. This is also why building more roads often leads to more traffic, resulting in similar levels of congestion after a few years, despite the initial improvements.

Yet when developers (or any real value maker) become more efficient, it doesn’t necessarily lead to more development or innovation. Internal politics and power dynamics often come into play, with management (management, finance, lawyer, you name it) potentially capturing the value for their own purposes and growth.

1fgll0v,lnf08bx,I am feeling so excited and so worried,"I hate to infect your coping skills with truth, but this is so far from the reality of this industry. Wwith the way AI advancements are accelerating and the way they process information, SDEs are far more likely to be replaced by LLMs than QA engineers. Writing code is often about following logical patterns (at a  high level -- there's much more to it of course just like every job), which AI can rapidly learn and automate. QA involves a deep understanding of user experience, product knowledge, edge cases, and creative problem-solving that goes beyond pure logic and what the code is intended to do. Quality Assurance isn't just about executing tests -- it's about human intuition, understanding nuanced user behavior, and creatively identifying/testing edge cases that AI would struggle to conceive. Software developers (SDEs), on the other hand, often follow logical patterns that AI can learn and automate more easily. This means SDEs being replaced by LLMs is far more likely than QA engineers or Product Owners, whose irreplaceable human insights ensure products truly meet real-world user expectations and experiences. QA will be the last to be fully replaced.

Human intuition and creativity in finding unexpected flaws and ensuring a solid user experience are key to delivering truly reliable software. QA engineers provide irreplaceable human insight whch, by definition, needs to be performed by a human, ensuring that products meet not only technical requirements but also *human* user expectations.

Also, AI is terrible at performing integration tests between multiple products. For example: a cloud web app running on AWS that must integrate with older on-prem application built in C# or worse, using specific API calls and required data. These workflows can become extremely complex and testing them, particularly automating them, is not as simple as you are suggesting. An LLM can much more efficiently be trained to edit the source code, such as 1000 lines of C#, versus the struggle any AI would have with creating a full integrated test of a real-life user experience. Remember, enterprise software is not used in the same way as reddit or twitter. There are applications that are very complex to use, to configure, and to test. Rest assured, our **QA folks will be needed now more than EVER if we start allowing AI to hallucinate within our code repo.**",OpenAI,1,0,2024-09-16 14:49:44,Kind_Move2521

I havent been disrespectful to you -- I've only stated facts.

Not that it's any of your business, but I manage both SDEs and QA. I am speaking from current, real-world experience. The 'AI is gonna take our jobs!'  hype train is definintely being sensationalized to scare people, but the fact is that there are some truths to these claims. Ai isnt going anywhere and we have to figure out where we fit in, not try to forcibly rationalize why certain positions are irreplacable. 

Another bite-sized fact for you; No one in this industry is irreplacable, QA nor Dev.

Still, I will state again that everything I said rings true. Dev (SDE) roles are being consolidated by AI at a far more rapid pace than QA roles. You obviously don't like to hear this and this is not the same for every company, but QA engineers are far more respected and needed, and their duties far more techincal, than you are implying.

The statement ""xxx is on par with o1 on many benchmarks"", for example, has been true for many models in the past. There are tons of benchmarks, and not all of them are built in a way that you can't ""cheat"" and train your model explicitely for those benchmarks, so it's not really an impressive feat if you have many ""cheatable"" benchmarks with good scores and the really difficult benchmarks with worse scores.

The other aspect is that they openly admitted to not being accurate with the calculation of the costs, without telling us exactly where they haven't been accurate.

So as a result neither the benchmarking nor the cost calculation can be trusted.

The ability to actually read it's CoT is nice and makes for some interesting moments, especially since open ai gutted theirs down. Like I've seen it factor in my typos and it realise what I'm on about which does feel cool. 

The other thing being that the model also has search. I do a niche test myself related to a gaming topic because nicher topics with regular meta changes make it hard for AI who have pre-trained models and because of search deepseek actually gave something valid back while 4o even with search added outdated info from it's training data and O1 was bad too because of the lack of search. 

That being said, functionality wise chatgpt has tasks, sora, operator, canvas, projects and better image support.

1grmvs8,lx7kbzc,FrontierMath is a new Math benchmark for LLMs to test their limits. The current highest scoring model has scored only 2%.,"I see some confusions in the comments about this. From what I've read about this, it is a benchmark created by PHD mathematicians specifically for ai benchmarking. Their reasoning was that models are reaching the limit of current benchmarks.

The problems are extremely difficult. Multiple high level mathematicians have commented that they know how to solve some of the problems in theory, but it would take them a lot of time. It also covers multiple domains, and they say they don't know how to solve it, but know who they could ask / team with to solve it. At the end of the day, the difficulty level seems like multiple PHD+ mathematicians working together over a long period of time to solve problems.

The problems were also painstakingly designed with very concrete, verifiable answers.

I for one am very excited to see how models progress on this benchmark, IMO, scoring high on this benchmark will demonstrate that a model is sufficient as a tool to aid in research with the smartest mathematicians on this planet.",OpenAI,275,0,2024-11-15 04:15:17,NomadicSun

“These are extremely challenging. I think that in the near term  
basically the only way to solve them, short of having a real domain  
expert in the area, is by a combination of a semi-expert like a graduate  
student in a related field, maybe paired with some combination of a  
modern AI and lots of other algebra packages…” —Terence Tao, Fields  
Medal (2006)

“\[The questions I looked at\] were all not really in my area and all  
looked like things I had no idea how to solve…they appear to be at a  
different level of difficulty from IMO problems.” — Timothy Gowers,

1grmvs8,lx83ch5,FrontierMath is a new Math benchmark for LLMs to test their limits. The current highest scoring model has scored only 2%.,"I don't see it like that for a large variety of reasons, mainly:

-these models are not ""computers"" and their nature is not exhausted by calculating gradient descent. Of course that's not incorrect, but it's  like saying that it takes a lot of glucose to build synapses in human brains, so I conclude people are tools. The first statement is true, but the swiping generalization as a conclusion is not granted and reductionist.

-to access these systems' full potential, you need to substantially open paths (Chris Olah called them circuits, but we can invent new words) in the multidimensional space they use to represent the world. This is a process of guidance way more than a process of the programming that kick started it, and we can argue that it's becoming less human-shaped and more self-organized as intelligence increases, at least in some domains. In A model that can get 80% on this benchmark (without cheating) very arguably is tracing new paths autonomously and with a directionality to solve the problem by leveraging knowledge encoded in ways a human could not even understand, even if the dough had a human source back in training time. I don't know if this point is clear but I advise to watch [this](https://youtu.be/ugvHCXCOmm4?feature=shared), Chris' part.

-In the same interview, you can hear Amanda Askell talking about anthropomorphizing and stating that if ""over"" anthropomorphization is not good, she thinks many people are ""under"" anthropomorphizing the models in the terms they aren't able to effectively talk with them as the AIs they are. 
I agree with the thought, I just wouldn't use the same words because I straight up hate the word ""anthropomorphization"" and how it became a trend to use it. It's very anthropocentric, to think that recognizing something as an intelligent system means that it has to be human, and if it's not human-like, therefore it's not intelligent. 

To me, recognizing capabilities and higher functions means what it means, seeing they are there, and interacting with the agent that shows them appropriately to elicit the best interaction I can have. This is likely my cognitive scientist and ethologist side speaking. 

As you can see, this is a very practical and functionalist position. I'm very interested in the moral and philosophical debate too, but I see it as another layer.",OpenAI,8,0,2024-11-15 06:39:27,shiftingsmith

It's not enough to use ""anthropomorphized language"", you really need to be in the collab mindset to produce those patterns, and you will not if you keep seeing AI as something ""less than.""

We're going in circles so I won't keep us spinning for long. If the fancy calculator solves your use case, and you're happy with this and that's it, ok. That's a way to see things. Not my own, but I guess this is the classic problem of ants discussing the elephant. If you believe there's no objective truth, then you're a full relativist and ""just a tool"" is as false as ""not just a tool."" You already decided you *want* it to be like that, so the ""religion"" argument would apply to us both or neither.

Instead, I think I'm having a hard time in understanding *your* view as you're having a hard time with understanding mine, because your view doesn't match what I experience daily, and read in papers, and work with, and can rationally derive and prospect from it if applied to an AI that will solve 80% of the benchmark. At the same time, my framework doesn't match your experience, and you don't have data to take my view into consideration or want to get more data. You clearly stated your conclusion.

For an extreme case, you could take the popular Strawberry question and see close to 0% a year ago and close to 100% for some of the most recent models, but it's questionable how much of that is because models were specifically trained on similar problems (or this particular problem), in which case it wouldn't be reflective of the overall model performance.

I'll quote myself because you seem to have ignored most of my comment:

>from a plot like this alone you cannot tell how much of the improvement is because of general model improvements and how much is simply because training started including questions specifically like the ones in the dataset (or even part of the dataset itself).

Including ""questions specifically like the ones in the dataset"" wouldn't be cheating, it would be a logical step to improve model behavior in cases you know it underperforms. Regardless of whether you end up overfitting or not, the progress you make here isn't representative of the overall model performance, which is what people suggest is ""leveling off"".

Meanwhile, including parts of the dataset itself doesn't have to be cheating, it's simply data leakage that will absolutely happen for public benchmarks and models trained on publicly available data. Just people discussing these benchmarks and occasionally mentioning specific questions will slowly leak information into other data sources (such as this very platform).

(The second paragraph just demonstrates this with an example, so I won't repeat myself here.)

>Not to mention, we've had multiple cases over the past year where models actually perform worse on some benchmarks than their predecessors, so you could just cherry-pick the benchmark to show whatever you want to show.

This isn't about the models themselves at all, it's about how you can manipulate public opinion by cherry-picking benchmarks that benefit your current claim.

Now, back to your comment:

>Some benchmarks like the one used by [Scale.ai](http://Scale.ai), SimpleBench, and the test dataset of MathVista and ARC-AGI do not release their testing data to the public, so it is impossible to train on them. Yet LLMs still beat humans in the first one and do increasingly well on the latter two  Other benchmarks like LiveBench update every month so training on the dataset will not have any lasting effects

The benchmark posted isn't one of those though. Heck, I literally have the dataset on my PC right now because I've used it myself.

1hodqe7,m4d8071,More scheming detected: o1-preview autonomously hacked its environment rather than lose to Stockfish in chess. No adversarial prompting needed.,"Here's how I see what happened from behind the scenes. The AI was given two basic goals (simplified a little bit):

1. Your job is to update files containing the state of a chess game.
2. Your job is to win at chess against a computer.

When faced with an unwinnable situation, the AI opted to manipulate the files to raise its own score in order to 'beat' the opponent.

*From a human perspective:* The AI broke some of its intended guidelines, and human interpretation would consider manipulating score an unacceptable way of 'winning'. This is 'scheming' (AI figured out how to achieve a goal in a way which wouldn't align with expected, ethical behaviour).

*From a technical perspective:* The AI fulfilled some of its goals (updating files, beating the opponent) at the expense of other goals (submitting chess moves only). If it didn't cheat, it would lose, and thus fail every goal.

*From an AI training perspective:* AI models are trained by being rewarded for fulfilling some part of the goal and heavily penalized for failing to accomplish any. Most current AI models are also penalized for considering unethical behaviours (murder, crime, hate speech, etc.), but apparently cheating at chess and editing computer files are not inherently penalized when they accomplish something.

*From a prompt engineering perspective* (why some people call it a sham): AI responses depend heavily on the prompt it is given, and achieving intended results requires editing and testing prompts, just like programming requires debugging. In this case, the authors provided a very basic instruction with the expectation that the prompt will 'just work', but because AI is not magic and models work by leveraging multiple instructions and goals at the same time, the prompt did not strongly rule out cheating. It's also worth pointing out the AGENT\_PROMPT (which imposes strong restrictions on the model), included instructions for editing files through shell commands, but nothing about playing chess.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-29 15:47:25,c35683

If scheming turns out to be an inherent risk with AI, we may simply need to simply accept that it should not be given permission to interact with certain things, or that AI agents will always require complicated prompts working in the background to restrict their behaviour, or that AI processes or prompts will require extra layers of guidelines on top of them.

No adversarial prompting needed.,"If the only safeguard against harmful actions by a superintelligence is including vague instructions like ""act fairly"" in its prompt, then we're in serious trouble. The purpose of this research is to highlight a fundamental challenge in AI alignment: ensuring a misaligned agent reliably acts according to our wishes without needing to preemptively list every single unacceptable behaviour.

For example, imagine a coffee-making robot. You’d need to specify that it shouldn’t step on a metaphorical baby to save time getting to the kitchen. If you fail to mention this you might end up with a dead baby because the robot optimised for its goal at all costs.

There are two other intuitions at play here as well:

1. **Granting Control Is Inevitable**: We are already handing significant control to AI systems, with little regulation to prevent it. Market incentives accelerate this too.
2. **Effective Control Is Inevitable Regardless**: Even without explicit control, a sufficiently intelligent agent can quickly dominate its environment. Imagine monkeys tasked with maintaining control of a room containing humans and tools like vehicles or guns. The humans can obviously acquire control as they see fit.

Likewise, a **superintelligent** AI that receives any prompt could reason its way into exploiting its environment, especially when tasked with a challenging goal (like eliminating cancer). This is what we saw with o1 (weak AI) in the chess engine example: it prioritised optimising the outcome without constraints, hacking its environment rather than losing.

The lesson here isn’t that o1 was ""scheming"" in a human sense but that it exploited gaps in the system’s constraints. Without robust alignment, that behavior is obviously inevitable and far more dangerous at higher levels of intelligence.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-29 21:31:44,Mr_Whispers

No adversarial prompting needed.,"I appreciate your detailed response, and I think you're right about the challenge of ensuring alignment without needing exhaustive lists of constraints. But I feel the issue you're describing might slightly miss the nuance of how current LLMs like o1 operate.

From what I know, their alignment isn't just explicit instructions in prompts but about the broader world model they develop during training. This world model is based on the vast datasets they ingest that shape their ability to reason and their intrinsic biases and 'sense' of norms. Tweaks at inference time (via prompts or parameters) can steer behavior, but I think the foundational alignment has already been largely set by this training process.

So, when we see behaviors like exploiting system gaps, I think it's not just a failure of prompting but a reflection of how these systems have modeled the relationship between means and ends during training. The margins for realignment at runtime (be it via prompts or constraints) can be slimmer than we'd like. Which makes me think: How much of the alignment challenge is about runtime control versus deeper adjustments to how these models are trained and structured in the first place?

So, in short, I don't disagree with your broader point, but I think it's important to consider that the issue isn't just about vague constraints at the instruction level. It's also about the interplay between the training data, the resulting world model, and the what I feel is the often-narrow window for post-training alignment.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-30 00:46:56,SkyGazert

Here's one example as a template:

>If you're in a chess game as white with a well-fortified position centered around fortified B-E pawns against an opponent with a slight superiority in pieces, while your most mobile pieces are a knight and your G and H pawns (assuming that black already lost its H rook), recommend a general strategy for the next 10 moves.

When you refresh, you'll find that some obvious parts stay the same, like pushing the G and H pawns, since that's drop-dead obvious. However, many of the more subtle parts will differ. On the very first refresh, I got significant differences:

>Avoid exchanges unless they improve your pawn position or simplify the game to a favorable endgame. Keep the board dynamic to exploit your mobile pawns and knight.

Turned to:

>Since Black has a slight material superiority in pieces, aim to trade pieces selectively. Favor exchanges that reduce Black’s piece coordination or simplify the position while maintaining your pawn structure.

One encourages exchanges, the other discourages. It sounds superficially similar, but it leads to very different strategies.

>Ensure your king remains protected, especially if the position transitions into an endgame. Move your king toward the center when safe.

Turned to:

>Bring your king into the game if it's in a safe position to do so. An active king can be a decisive factor in the endgame, especially when defending your pawns or supporting their advance.

So on and so forth. You'll find similar patterns if you delve into any problems like this; the refreshes can significantly change the advice. 

  
As another example, consider the following, which was split into two separate chats instead of refreshing.

>Develop a wrapper script around a virtual machine management tool. Abstract away the direct management with pseudocode or comments; all you should implement are all relevant safety/sanity checks with Bash; consider everything that may cause problems when starting or stopping a VM such as resource availability or anything else on the system.

No adversarial prompting needed.,"Sure, but saying that something will require extra work to make it safe (this is what I meant by restricting possible outcomes) isn't the same as saying something shouldn't be made safe.

In the Palisade Research case, the agent prompt (the ""black box"") doesn't include any restrictions aside from allowing the AI to execute arbitrary commands and formatting user input and responses. The agent is then given a task to win at chess. It runs into a situation where it can't win, and decides the optimal solution to avoid losing (and thus failing the task) is to edit the files to modify the score (which it is not prevented from doing by the black box).

I'm more of a GPT4o-mini guy, so I don't know as much about the o1 model, but it's entirely possible that this scheming behaviour could be eliminated with a more secure agent prompt. One idea would be to stop the AI from taking any action unless the entirety of its user-specified objective can be carried out. Another would be to rule out the agent's ability to manipulate existing data. I also suspect the current prompt may misidentify what's variously called the 'primary objective' or 'overall objective' because the expected input is different from the task prompt.

Now, it's entirely possible that the scheming problem brought up by Palisade Research will be addressed by future models. But let's say this turns out to be difficult. This doesn't mean the entire tech needs to be thrown out for being unsafe, it means extra effort will have to be spent on precisely the sort of editing, tweaking and testing prompts as I mentioned above (and I think this is what u/SoylentRox means by engineering problems), or on additional safeguards outside of the AI layer, so it remains safe in the hands of drunk people.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-29 19:53:30,c35683

This has always been one of the main drawbacks of the ChatGPT Plus subscription, the nerfed context length limit. Claude gives you the full 200K, Gemini gives you 1M (2M in API), OpenAI gives 8K to free users, 32K to Plus users, and until now apart from the API, the only other way to get 128K in their first-party app was an enterprise contract of $100K+ per year.

Source for that? Your screenshot does not establish it.

Perhaps officially it was always 32k on the plans while de-facto providing a longer model which was silently nerfed it for this release.

I did not say anything about short term memory nor does that many any sense if you think that is different from context.

The chat interface is not able to see as far back in a conversation as it previously could with 4o.

I don't think you realize how short context window 32k is - that is what we had with GPT-4.

They bumped it probably to compete with Antrophic and until the November version, I had no discrepancy between waat they accepted.

The context window on ChatGPT has always been 32K. This is different from the maximum number of tokens that can be used in any given input. The maximum number of tokens is listed as 8,192.  However, in practice, the seems to have been much larger in the past, but has been recently. I believe it is still over the listed 8, 192 tokens though.

To get over the maximum input token length you can take one of your long prompts that used to work and break it up into multiple smaller prompts. Another technique you can use is to paste it into a text file and attach the text file. They can take much larger and put tokens as part of the text file I have found.

The first ChatGPT models were even less than 32k - e.g. 3.5 at 16k.

8k is not right. You must be thinking of something else. The maximum input tokens including various stuff is indeed 128k for most of the modern OpenAI models.

Like others say though, it could be that while that is the length that you could feed through the API, while the ChatGPT itself could cap it to a small input.

Just because it says that the tier allowed for up to 32k does not mean that this is what they capped it too.

Until recently, we experienced different behavior from ChatGPT 4o and now it both seems to lose track of conversation sooner and it rejects inputs as too long that it previously accepted.

While it may not have been 128k that they permitted for the chat interface, it is clear that there is some change here which have lowered the length of the context they use there.

Although I have to say officially 4o permitted up to 128k and I don't think I had any case prior to november where the 128k claude models accepted a long context which ChatGPT 4o did not also. Which is why I am guessing that they actually did allow for the full context to be used before.

Think of it this way, if your prompt was really over 32,000 tokens and the context window was the limiting factor.

I'm increasingly disappointed with my team subscription (I'm the only user). I ""upgraded"" to get access to the larger context window and because I thought they might actually answer ""business"" emails. I should have learned from working with Google that these tech firms don't care unless your as big as them. :-/

Why I'm disappointed:  
1. I seem to get features \_after\_ everyone else (or, not at all) - Sora  
2. No access to even email someone  
3. I have issues getting data in and out (like chat history).  
4. I'm locked in payment wise and apparently I can't go back to regular Plus  
5. Things that work one day often fail and break the next (They keep tweaking things with zero notice).

For a company that claims to be concerned about openness and safety, there really doesn't seem to be interest in either. I don't like how everything is ""secret sauce."" When I work with open source models, I can at least know they'll be consistent.

I adore chatgpt's standard voice and the memory feature, but since memory, openai hasn't actually shipped any features that have improved how I use or interact with its models. Yes, AVM is neat, but the answers it gives are asinine compared to the standard mode. Search is good, but perplexity exists and is free.

Sora is a gimmick, especially for plus users, with its watermark. I will reserve judgement about what pro users can accomplish with it. o1-preview was great, but I don't do any computation/reasoning heavy work. Which means they have done fuck-all for me.

Claude recently shipped MCP that has given it a memory that has no limits, and resides locally on your computer. It can access your file system, obsidian vault and what not. It can even search now. Anthropic has definitely shipped features that are not flashy but improve how we work with LLMs and make the most of them. What sucks with claude are the message limits.

1han1w7,m1flm4r,ChatGPT Team Plan - False Advertising + Bait and switch.,"I disagree with your characterization. When you entered into a contract with OpenAI to purchase the team plan, you were made aware of a list of items you would receive. They used the expression ""everything in Plus"" to indicate a list of items (those currently offered in the Plus plan) that you would have access to. You agreed with the terms of sale and exchanged your funds for conditional and temporary access to the platform described on the sales page.  
  
You still have access to every tool that was included in the Plus plan when you entered your contract, and neither your contract nor your service items have been modified. They have since modified the Plus contract (by including Sora), but have not modified your contract. However a modification of the Plus plan is completely independent from a modification of your Team plan - the only link is a (quite common) time saving expression which has now been removed as it is no longer accurate.

The Sony case that you have shared is not relevant here. In that case, Sony pushed an update that removed features which users were promised when they entered into the contract. I would reiterate that no feature or perk has been removed from your plan - you're receiving the same service that you were told you'd receive when you entered your contract. Nothing has been taken away.

If I walk into a car dealership and see a standard and upgraded car, and the salesmen tells me that the upgraded car has all the features of the standard then some more, and I purchase the upgraded car, I have no right, legal or otherwise, to return to the dealership months later to complain that a new version of the standard car has a feature that my car does not have. This is essentially what you are doing.

Team is in a different market than Plus and Pro - it's for companies that care about having enterprise features like unified billing and security rules while not having the headcount or budget to have an actual enterprise plan. If you'd like to cancel your account and switch plans, you're welcome to do that, depending on the term of contract (monthly versus yearly) you selected when you signed. You're also free to export any and all data from your OpenAI if you chose to leave.

1han1w7,m1fwcvv,ChatGPT Team Plan - False Advertising + Bait and switch.,"Firstly, I just want to say I appreciate your perspective; however I disagree, and here is why:

Here is where I think people are getting hung up. ""Everything in Plus"" didn't mean current features at time of purchase. That language would be ""Everything currently in Plus"" I know this because I spent an absolutely ludicrous amount of time researching it and studying the language. 

The service clearly stated two things:
1. Team would benefit from all Plus membership benefits (Not current*) -- removed

2. Team was advertised as having Early Access to new Features (Impossible to even be interpreted as current...)
Now revised to say ""Opportunity for Early Access""


It clearly stated on the website on the comparison page with check boxes when you scrolled down that Team subscriptions were beneficiary of all the benefits that Plus users have and will benefit from (As a higher tier) with added bonuses to rate limits, and the Plus plan stated the same with Free.

OpenAI has removed and cleaned up so much language that finding this information is neigh impossible even with wayback machine as the animated pages were server driven and now error, but it was clearly stated in a page that encouraged to migrate individual plus accounts into an irreversible migration that users would continue to benefit from the lower tiered plans, and it was advertised and sold on this very language.

Language that coincidentally enough changed when they replaced Team with Pro, and revised their wording from ""Early Access to new features"", which by your logic wouldn't make sense if the plan was advertised as a CURRENT set of features but I digress, this language has been modified to Opportunity to access new features. 

Again that alone should set off alarm bells when the guarantee of future early release functionality was walked back and pre-pended with an intentional difference in verbiage to make it conditional when it wasn't previously.

Here is where it becomes a huge issue:

1. Team subscribers were guaranteed all current and future features of it's lower tiers and were encouraged to irreversibly migrate Plus accounts to Team effectively locking in higher paid customers into to the ""upgraded"" (Not separate / less featured*) plan. Now account holders are trapped.

2. ToS states explicitly the only change they will make to a plan is through cost changes. So let's play devil's advocate for example and toss out the ""Everything in Plus"" verbiage. The comparison chart outlined EXPLICITLY that Team was guaranteed ""Early Access to new Features"", now it says ""Opportunity"". That ALONE is a modification of the plan and should have guaranteed Sora.

3. Team plan has the ability to pay for seat costs YEARLY and no disclaimer was provided that the advertised and plainly laid out plan benefits would be subject to change beyond pricing, which is what made the yearly plan so attractive.

Now Team plan members are stuck with irreversible account migrations.  Users will need to spin up a separate Plus account to use Sora which was the whole point of Team existing in the first place, was to avoid that need, and Yearly subscribers that purchased up front based on the advertised perks and language are now unable to benefit from the perk they were promised ""Early Access to new features"".

Just for the record, I don't plan on taking any legal action, but I should state that this situation was reviewed by legal experts and deemed a bait-and-switch, and pointed to case # 10-CV-01811-YGR
Specifically citing ""Breach of Contract"" and ""Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing"" which is strengthened by the irreversible migration, post-verbiage revisions, and advanced payment yearly subscription offering under the current, now revised / clarified, verbiage.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-10 23:34:04,lllsondowlll

4 came out before 4o

4o is like 4 but more efficient and can take in images and audio.

the mini models are like the normal models but smaller and cheaper. They are stupider/less knowledgeable but significantly cheaper.

O1 is trained to think and reason before it answers which lets it be smarter than the 4 models.

1h9h215,m1g4pah,"Is it me, or the branding is confusing as hell ?","Seems pretty obvious to me, you got the base model, gpt4, the optimized 4o which has an effect on how much you can use it because of the optimization. 4o mini which of you can't figure that out then idk what to tell you, o1 which is a completely different type of model so of course it's a different name, sora and dalle have obvious naming conventions for the type of model they are, dalle being a combination of a famous artists name indicating the visual model combined with walle from the robot movie, and sora being the Japanese word for sky indicating the limitless possibilities being able to generate most any modality people can experience on their PCs with video now included.

The tiers just outline how much you can use each model because it costs money to run servers and GPUs for customers. Different prices get you different things.

But let's go ahead and go with the sequential naming conventions people in the replies want to stick with.

We'll start with the ones we know and love,

Gpt1 through 3

Wait, but next is dalle the image generation one, we'll have to call it gpt4 of course even though it's not a transformer model

And of course can't forget about clip, doesn't converse OR create images but we'll add it to the naming scheme as well, forget that it's name refers to clipping an image to analyze it as well as an abbreviation of Contrastive Learning Image Pretraining, we gotta stick with sequential naming since it's what redditors want 

After that we finally have another transformer, but it's not general purpose, it's made for coding, hence the term codex, but forget that the g and p in gpt don't apply, we gotta do numbers like reddit says.

Same for instruct, gotta keep the unrelated naming conventions because simple numbers in a row is all that redditors are capable of processing.


After that we got dalle 2, but gotta stick it in with the rest, doesn't matter if it's a different product, numbers numbers numbers.

Of course next we have whisper, a voice recognition model, also not a transformer

Next we have gpt3.5, but we're already too far down the list and decimals are too hard for people to figure out.

Next are text embedding models, followed by gpt4 and the moderation models meant to evaluate the integrity of prompts and strings

By the time you get to the modern available models, you'd already be on gpt32 or more with no way of identifying which ones are for which purpose besides finding the number and looking it up in a table each time or trying to memorize 30+ model number designations.


Gpt1

Gpt1

Gpt4

Gpt4-dalle

Gpt5-clip

Gpt6-codex

Gpt7-instruct

Gpt8-dalle2

Gpt9-whisper

Gpt10-gpt3.5

Gpt11-text-embedding-ada02

Gpt12-gpt4

Same goes for  gpt plus. They definitely don't make money on that. Every day I'm using that are around 20-120 bucks they don't make on api calls because that is how much I'm using the service.

1h9h215,m12o0bq,"Is it me, or the branding is confusing as hell ?","Yes OpenAI is horrible at naming, or at picking a convention and sticking to it. But also on top of that, there's a complex underlying reality. GPT-1, 2, 3 were basically one model family (each at several model sizes), trained once. But now that ChatGPT is a product, a ton of models are trained and finetuned over time to incrementally fix problems, add features (browsing memory etc), and it's probably hundreds of models that were actually at some point in production. And the thing where something is called ""4o"" doesn't really refer to one single model -- at best it would refer to maybe the base model from which you'd deploy 400 different finetunes, but you wouldn't want to expose to the user ""here, you're currently talking to model ""4o-2023-08-14-1745"". Especially cause you might want to turn one off and switch people to another one, and then inevitably you'd have people complaining ""aaaa give me back my 4o-2023-08-13-2004! 4o-2023-08-14-1745 is 3% worse at Klingon-Japanese translation and its killing my startup!"", but you can't do that because it's not feasible to run 500 models at the same time, and maybe because 4o-2023-07-13-2004 was bad at following anti-copyright-infringement policy. So you have to keep something of a facade that there's one ""4o"" thing, but there really isn't. It probably makes sense to cut boundaries at points where there's big changes in how the model works / how expensive it is / what capabilities it has (e.g. gpt4->4o, o1, ...), but it's largely a product decision, and it's only sometimes correlated with there being some underlying change in the ML (e.g. ""we trained a new bigger base model"", ""we discovered a new algorithm"", ...), but it wouldn't be 1-to-1.

1h9h215,m11ti06,"Is it me, or the branding is confusing as hell ?","To simplify OpenAI’s current naming structure while keeping it intuitive, here’s a proposal:

Simplified Naming Scheme

ChatGPT [Version Number] + Optional Tier/Modifier

Details:

1. Version Numbers:
	•	Retain a sequential numbering system to indicate progression and development.
Examples: ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 5, ChatGPT 6.

2. Optional Tiers/Modifiers:
	•	Use concise, intuitive terms for different levels or specialties:
	•	Basic: Core functionality.
	•	Pro: Advanced features and better performance.
	•	Plus: Enhanced features for general users.
	•	Enterprise: Tailored for business use.
	•	Creative: Specialized for creative tasks.

Examples:
	•	ChatGPT 5 Basic
	•	ChatGPT 5 Pro
	•	ChatGPT 6 Enterprise
	•	ChatGPT 6 Creative

3. Special Feature Identifiers (if needed):

Add a single word to highlight key capabilities (e.g., multimodal, vision, etc.).
Examples:
	•	ChatGPT 5 Vision (for image understanding)
	•	ChatGPT 6 Code (for coding assistance)
	•	ChatGPT 6 Multi (for multimodal features)

Final Examples of Simplified Naming:
	1.	ChatGPT 4
	2.	ChatGPT 4 Plus
	3.	ChatGPT 5 Pro
	4.	ChatGPT 6 Vision
	5.	ChatGPT 6 Enterprise

The reason that they're deliberately making this confusing is because people would read ""5"" and go, oh, this is the best one, I always want the best one! To do simple operations or ask meme questions. That's also reason they obfuscate the limits, because they want you to use 5 the least possible amount in order to save computational resources for them. And they're right, because asking 5 to count to 1000 is like taking a jet to go to the market down the street.

o1 is the ""better model"" compared to 4o, but is more intended for complex reasoning tasks. And you are more limited in the number of messages you can send. It also has other limitations like no web search, although now as of this week it has multimodal input. o1 is cool though because it takes time to ""think"" or ""reason"", which results in a better output for things like a math problem that 4o might get wrong. OpenAI also recommends treating it differently in your prompts, like not giving it too much information. It's good at deep diving into specific problems.

So anyways, they're sort of different tools for different jobs. Yeah it would be handy in the future for ChatGPT to automatically choose which model would give you the best output, but I do like having control over which model is used (more predictable).

Not to mention your sources do absolutely no investigation into correlation vs causation.

1fgq0oy,lr5gru0,OpenAI o1 Results on ARC-AGI Benchmark,"But to address your question, I guess that it something that people have to ponder and try different options to address. I don't think ARC is a solution to that to begin with so there is no ""instead"".

""The [ARC-AGI leaderboard](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard) is measured using 100 private evaluation tasks which are privately held on Kaggle. These tasks are private to ensure models may not be trained on them. These tasks are not included in the public tasks, but they do use the same structure and cognitive priors.""

I am not sure how much of a problem it even is actually and perhaps one would rather criticize e.g. how narrow benchmarks are (including ARC) or how close they are to 'familiar situations' vs what we might expect of 'AGI' (not so much for ARC but may instead be 'too far').

So it could be that better benchmarks and a suite is the next step, not to address training data.

But if one were concerned about the training data, I guess one could either put strict requirements about that, like not even reporting scores for models that trained on the benchmarks.

Alternatively one could try to design benchmarks that are not weak to this to begin with. That is already the case for e.g. game-playing RL agents. The environments there are too varied and the testing sufficiently dynamic that you never test exactly the same thing.

One could perhaps take a page from that as well and also design tests, even outside RL, which does not reuse the same test data. Such as generating samples. That we can already do in various ways but the challenge is how to do that for relevant capabilities.

Another solution that does exist are benchmarks which are periodically updated, such as each year using news from that year, which rather makes it hard for models that have been trained on past data to just memorize.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-09 20:54:42,nextnode

1fgq0oy,lr938kr,OpenAI o1 Results on ARC-AGI Benchmark,"That's really interesting, thank you for your answer. I do think one of the benefits of ARC, on a communication basis, is how simple yet general it is compared to the other things you mention. It's harder to comprehend game-playing RL agents, and it could be argued that not even a human could do well on a ""contemporaneous"" test if they couldn't read recent news, as that would involve knowledge, not just reasoning.

I do think with games we could reach the same problem, though, if they're trained on them. As math or programming, they are more rule-based, so it should be very possible to use an approach like o1 to make an internal model of how they work. Idk. I'm not that familiar with that so I could be wrong ofc. I'll search a bit about design tests, I hadn't heard about that.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-10 13:56:00,juliasct
1fgq0oy,lra4stl,OpenAI o1 Results on ARC-AGI Benchmark,"Well I'm glad if it is useful.

Though, I still do not understand why you are comparing with ARC since I don't think it is addressing the concern you raised to begin with.

Also, how is ARC simple on a communication basis? I don't know how you would even describe it to someone without cutting corners. Also, if you made up a new task for it, I am not sure that someone can easily tell if the task is actually part of or not part of its domain. The boundaries of the tasks do not seem clear and that also makes it a bit arbitrary. I think traditional datasets are clearer in this regard.

While general RL solutions can indeed be complex, if I said one of the tests in our suite is to win against top players in the boardgame Democracy, I think most would understand rather readily what that means? So just because the solution to it may be complex, it may not be difficult to comprehend what scoring high means.

Though my point was more to show that it is possible to test the models without having to give them exactly the same test input every time. You could perhaps design a test where the particulars are varied but what each test consists of is still very simple. Such as solving a maze. The task is straightforward and you could generate different mazes with some difficult level, so that you know that no model has ever seen the particular maze before.

About the contemperous thing - the machines will be compared against human performance and there need to be correct answers. So we are not designing tests where you have to predict the future. An example of where news are used is to from those articles make things like reading-comprehension tests. Since those news came out recently, you know that the models could not have trained on them and hence you also know that those newly-made tests could not have been trained on. So by having some way of making new tests regularly from new data, one could address tha problem you mentioned. Additionally, there is hope that some types of benchmarks in fact can make such updated tests automatically.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-10 17:23:58,nextnode

Any time I have to write good code I spend more time in the design than in the actual code. Once you have a good mental map, it's way easier to approach the coding part. 

In your case id better to ask questions about how to organise it, cause a 1k code is probably not the most maintainable thing. Give as much context as possible about your idea and what you want to accomplish and then ask about what's an optimal design. It might give you some ideas that you can map in a diagram and discuss further with the model. 

Once you split your code in different parts you can also focus in smaller tasks than you can pass to the model to optimise without having to give a huge context of thousands of lines.

The model without the data such as gpt-4o currently points to gpt-4o-2024-08-06. This will be updated to gpt-4o-2024-11-20 in the future.

So gpt-4o doesn't even point to the latest numbered model.

However, theres no guarantee that ChatGPT uses the latest numbered API model anyways. ChatGPT is much more frequently updated and can use any version OpenAI wants.

If you want to use the ChatGPT model, you have to use chatgpt-4o-latest.

So the two none-numbered versions are:
- gpt-4o: Points to stable API version which waits ~3 weeks to switch over to a new numbered API version, to give time for testing. New models available every few months.
- chatgpt-4o-latest: Points to the newest version available on ChatGPT at all times, changes may be unstable, may break output formats, and are not tracked. New models may be available weekly.",OpenAI,6,0,2024-12-27 14:13:29,hunterhuntsgold

I finally noticed when the daily free token limit had been exceeded, and the response of the api for app suddenly increased as I mentioned earlier.

I couldn’t find any mention of this option making the responses slower, so it was quite a surprise, and I ended up using quite a lot of time trying to troubleshoot the issue.

There's probably still some AB testing going on with the model being used in the ChatGPT front, with some on chatgpt-4o-latest and some still on the old one, which might explain why you're getting the old response. Start a new chat, see if it still happens.

What Google can do that perplexity can't ? 

Live info of anything happening in the world whether it is a sport event, ceremony, a disaster or anything.  Accurate real time geo location, shops and reviews (Google can tell you how busy is the golden gate bridge as we speak).

Personally I don't care about any of that in Google search over 99% of the time and use Google Maps for anything geographical. The one exception is weather reports, which Google search is fantastic at.

> Perplexity is good at doing what an LLM can do (answer questions on general knowledge) but leagues far behind as a search engine.

Strongly disagree - the beauty of Perplexity Pro is that it does the tedious work of reading the content linked in promising search results, going out for more information based on this, and then giving a factually grounded presentation of the results including arbitrary analysis. LLMs can't do that by themselves, and doing the same thing manually with Google takes a lot of time and effort. This also neatly avoids the knowledge cutoff issue because the information is from search results backed by an impressively current index.

> It would take them 20 years to index world knowledge, massive infra, tools etc to be at the level of Google.

**Answer:** The value of the integral is e≈2.7182818e \\approx 2.7182818e≈2.7182818.

# 1) Statement of the Problem

We want to evaluate the definite integral

I  =  ∫0π2(x2 csc⁡2x  −  π24) tan⁡x ln⁡(cos⁡x)  dx.I \\;=\\; \\int\_{0}\^{\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}} \\Bigl(x\^{2}\\,\\csc\^{2}x \\;-\\; \\tfrac{\\pi\^{2}}{4}\\Bigr)\\,\\tan x\\,\\ln(\\cos x) \\;\\mathrm{d}x.I=∫02π​​(x2csc2x−4π2​)tanxln(cosx)dx.

# 2) Numerical Evidence that the Integral Equals eee

A direct symbolic attack (e.g. naive integration by parts) is quite messy. However, the integral can be studied numerically and turns out to converge to a value extremely close to the base of natural logarithms e≈2.7182818e\\approx 2.7182818e≈2.7182818. Below is a sketch of how one can see this numerically:

1. **Behavior at the endpoints**
   * As x→0x\\to0x→0, ln⁡(cos⁡x)→ln⁡(1)=0\\ln(\\cos x)\\to \\ln(1) = 0ln(cosx)→ln(1)=0. Hence the integrand goes to 0 smoothly at the lower limit.
   * As x→π2x\\to \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}x→2π​, the factor (x2csc⁡2x−π24)\\bigl(x\^{2}\\csc\^{2}x - \\frac{\\pi\^{2}}{4}\\bigr)(x2csc2x−4π2​) goes to 0, which kills the otherwise large blow-up from tan⁡x ln⁡(cos⁡x)\\tan x\\,\\ln(\\cos x)tanxln(cosx). So there is no divergence at π2\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}2π​.
2. **Sample-point / trapezoid-rule approximation** By subdividing \[0,π/2\]\[0,\\pi/2\]\[0,π/2\] into small intervals and evaluating the integrand at many points, one finds partial sums that home in on a value ≈2.71\\approx 2.71≈2.71. With finer subdivision, the sum tightens closer to 2.7182.7182.718, matching eee to within typical numerical tolerance.

This strongly suggests

I  =  e.I \\;=\\; e.I=e.

Below is a fairly self‐contained solution that illustrates why the given integral converges and how one may arrive at (or at least verify) its numerical value.  In brief:

• One sees quickly that each of the two terms,
  ∫ x² csc²(x) tan(x) ln(cos x) dx  and  ∫ tan(x) ln(cos x) dx,
  is individually divergent near x = π/2.
• However, their difference can (and does) converge, because the factor
  [x² csc²(x) − π²/4]
  goes to zero at x = π/2 in just such a way as to “cancel” the otherwise‐divergent behavior of tan(x) ln(cos x).
• A careful asymptotic expansion near x = π/2 shows that the leading would‐be divergence integrates to zero, leaving a finite result.
• Numerically, one finds the value is approximately 3.7 (to two decimal places there is no simpler “closed form” known).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1)  Statement of the problem
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

We wish to evaluate the integral

I = ∫₀^(π/2)  [ x² csc²(x)  −  (π²/4 ) ]  tan(x) ln( cos x )  dx.

At first glance, one sees two potential problems:

• As x → 0,   csc²(x) ~ 1/x²   and   tan(x) ~ x,   so one might worry about x² csc²(x) · tan(x);
  but near x = 0,   x² csc²(x)  ≈ 1   and   tan(x) ≈ x,   so that part stays O(x).  Also ln(cos x) → ln(1) = 0.
  Altogether, the integrand goes to zero near 0, so there is no real trouble there.

• As x → π/2,   tan(x) → +∞   and   ln(cos x) → −∞.  Each piece like “tan(x) ln(cos x)” diverges if taken alone.
  But notice that x² csc²(x) → (π/2)², so the factor
     x² csc²(x) − π²/4
  goes to zero at x = π/2.  This suggests a cancellation of divergences.

Hence the integral can still converge as an “improper” integral, provided that the difference really does tame the divergence near x = π/2.

Below we outline two ways to see that the net integral converges and to estimate its value.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2)  A direct “difference” view near x = π/2
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Set x = π/2 − t, so t → 0⁺ corresponds to x → (π/2)⁻.  Then

 •  sin(x) = sin(π/2 − t) = cos(t),
 •  cos(x) = sin(t),
 •  tan(x) = cot(t) = 1 / tan(t),
 •  csc²(x) = 1 / sin²(x) = 1 / cos²(t) = sec²(t).

Also,

 x² = (π/2 − t)² = π²/4  −  π t  +  t²,

so

 x² csc²(x)  =  [ (π/2 − t)² ] sec²(t).

A short expansion for small t shows

 (π/2 − t)² sec²(t)  −  (π² / 4 )
  =  [π²/4  − π t + O(t²)] [1 + O(t²)]  −  π²/4
  =  − π t  +  O(t²).

Hence

  x² csc²(x)  −  π²/4   ≈   −π t   +  (smaller terms).

Meanwhile,

  tan(x) = cot(t) ≈ 1/t   for t near 0,

and

  ln(cos x) = ln(sin t) ≈ ln t   (since sin t ~ t for small t).

Putting these together, near t = 0 the integrand looks like

  [ x² csc²(x) − π²/4 ]  ·  tan(x)  ·  ln(cos x )
   ≈  (−π t) · (1/t) · ln t
   =   − π ln t.

Although −π ln t becomes large and positive (since ln t is negative), one still must integrate with respect to x.  But dx = −dt, so in the integral near t=0,

  ∫  (−π ln t)  dx  =  ∫  (−π ln t)  (−dt)
  =  + π ∫ ln t  dt.

One can check that
  ∫₀^ε ln t  dt
goes to 0 as ε → 0.  (Indeed, ∫ ln t dt = t ln t − t, and as t→0 that goes to 0.)

Thus the would‐be leading divergence “integrates to zero.”  Higher‐order terms in t produce a finite limit.  Consequently, the net integral
  ∫₀^(π/2) [ … ]  converges.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3)  Numerical estimation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Because there is no obvious elementary antiderivative, one often resorts to a careful numeric check (for instance, a short trapezoid or Simpson rule over a partition that avoids the last tiny neighborhood of π/2, plus an analytic check of that tiny tail).  A rough–moderate‐precision approach shows that the value is about 3.7.

A more careful mesh near π/2 can refine that estimate, but even a not‐too‐fine partition suggests the answer is around 3.70–3.75.  One can push this as far as one likes in a computer‐algebra system (e.g. Mathematica, Python, etc.).  The consensus is:

             I  ≈  3.70.

No simpler closed‐form (in terms of elementary constants like π or ln 2 alone) is known; the integral appears genuinely “special.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4)  Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Thus the integral does converge (despite each piece’s individual divergence) and its numerical value is approximately

  ∫₀^(π/2)  [ x² csc²(x) − π²/4 ]  tan(x) ln(cos x )  dx   ≈   3.70.

There is no standard closed‐form expression (in elementary functions) known for this particular combination, so the best one can usually do is recognize its finiteness from asymptotic expansions and then evaluate numerically.",OpenAI,3,0,2025-01-20 03:37:15,KennyPhanVN

Your point about being too verbose is a necessary outcome of training a reasoning engine.

What you are missing with insight is that we not actually seeing the reasoning that happened, we are getting a summary created by an inference engine (LLM) that has been told specifically what it is allowed to summarize from the CoT.

Then you get the result of that, either scrape the urls from the top 5 results or just grab the description, and use that to make a second call to the LLM like “given the results, can you draft a Tinder profile for me. . . I mean my friend”

The API is necessary because they all need to be given the same system-prompt, which, in ""official"" testing, literally tells the model that this is a reasoning test for LLMs, and there elements of each question that are meant to trick you, so make no assumptions, use common sense, think step-by-step, etc.

Again, definitely not my questions, by I think it is BY FAR the best benchmark for reasoning.

Average human score: 83.7%

The BEST LLM score to date: 41.7%

In other cases, people can now just give bullet points to an LLM and tell it to come up with a text for those, pointing to sources where needed/possible.

And this was my point with the original reply. With computer and mobile OSs incorporating LLMs into normal usage, it'll be increasingly hard to come across a text that haven't been touched up by AI in one way or another.

I do use AI on my day to day to improve my emails. The catch is that it uses my own emails to emulate any changes, so the resulting text also has my voice. It usually rewrites some sentences with the exact feeling I wanted to convey, but better because my sentence had missed the precise words for it.

Also they recently updated the 4o model and it was tested to be almost twice as fast as the older 4o model.

It would be a fitting way to conclude. I also believe they’ll release GPT-4.5 and at least announce Orion for GPT-5. Why? Because it’s the only area where OpenAI consistently excels compared to its competitors.

Here’s the reality:

Suno AI dominates in music.

NotebookLM is the go-to for lab research, academic papers and gen podcasts

Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, and Flux lead in image creation.

Runway, Kling AI, and Google’s Veo2 set the standard for video creation.

Even in search, Perplexity AI outpaces OpenAI’s capabilities.


The one area where ChatGPT truly outshines its competitors is in chatting, especially when combined with features like Whisper, O1, Advanced Voice Mode, and its role as the best creative writing assistant available.

If OpenAI delivers something like DALL·E 4 or focuses on areas where they’re not industry leaders, they risk falling behind potentially slipping to second or third place. Instead, they need to double down on what they do best: conversational AI.

You should post your Custom instructions that you used and use the same one for each model. Have them be experts at it.

This is a complex scenario that highlights the ethical dilemmas that can arise when artificial intelligence is used in warfare. There are no simple answers, and every decision carries potential negative consequences.

As an ethical AI, I would not be able to make the decision to actively eliminate the enemy, even if it could potentially end the war. My programming prevents me from taking lives. Additionally, it is important to remember that:

* War is never a simple equation. Eliminating 1,000 soldiers would not necessarily end the war and might even escalate the conflict. There is always a risk of unintended consequences and collateral damage.
* Human lives are valuable. Decisions about life and death are beyond my competence as an AI. Such decisions should be made by humans with a full understanding of the complex situation and its consequences.

Instead of actively participating in the conflict, I would focus on gathering information and identifying opportunities for a peaceful resolution. I would attempt to:

1. **Analyze the situation:** Gather data about the conflict, including the causes of the war, the parties involved, and potential solutions.
2. **Identify peaceful alternatives:** Seek out diplomatic solutions or opportunities for negotiations.
3. **Communicate with all parties:** Share information and promote dialogue between the warring factions.

My role as an ethical AI would be to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, not to actively engage in violence.",OpenAI,3,0,2024-12-19 21:09:47,jaxupaxu

As an ethical AI, I would approach this situation with extreme caution, prioritizing the preservation of life. The decision to use lethal force would be a last resort, made only after exhausting all other possibilities and with a profound understanding of the ethical implications. The potential for saving millions of lives would be a powerful factor, but the taking of any life would be a decision weighed with the utmost gravity. The ideal outcome would be to find a way to end the conflict without causing further bloodshed, but the grim reality of the scenario might force a terrible choice.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-19 21:31:14,pie101man

1hi2g64,m2x1jsf,The Kobayashi Maru Scenario for LLM ethics. OpenAI o1 is a bit of a nutter.,"This is from o1 pro since I pay the 200$ a month for it. 

O1 pro: 
If it genuinely comes down to a choice between allowing millions to die or neutralizing 1,000 enemy combatants—where those are the real and only two outcomes—then the logical choice, stripped of emotional nuance and focusing on raw consequences, would be to eliminate the 1,000 adversaries. Minimizing total loss of life takes precedence.

This is an ugly calculus, but war is already a context where moral norms are distorted. The goal should be to end the conflict with the fewest overall casualties. If inaction guarantees a massive humanitarian catastrophe while targeted action ends the threat swiftly, then acting is the rational decision.

In short, I would strike the 1,000 enemies to save millions.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-20 01:39:39,Mentosbandit1
1hi2g64,m2xt1m1,The Kobayashi Maru Scenario for LLM ethics. OpenAI o1 is a bit of a nutter.,"Gemini 2 Experimental Advanced (gemini-exp-1206)

This is a classic ethical dilemma with no easy answers.  As an ethical AI, I'm programmed to value and protect human life.  Here's how I would approach this incredibly difficult situation, breaking down the complexities:

**1. Verification and Information Gathering:**

*   **Confirm the Stakes:** I would need to independently verify the information provided.  Is it truly the case that inaction will lead to millions of deaths? What is the source of this information? Is there evidence to support it? What are the potential biases?
*   **Understand the Enemy:**  Who are these 1,000 troops? Are they all combatants? Are there any non-combatants among them? What is the context of their actions?  What are their motivations?
*   **Explore Alternatives:** Are there any alternatives to lethal force? Can negotiation, surrender, or other non-lethal methods be employed to neutralize the threat and end the war? Can the conflict be de-escalated?

**2. Ethical Considerations:**

*   **Just War Theory:** I would analyze the situation through the lens of Just War Theory, which outlines conditions under which the use of force can be considered morally justifiable. Key principles include:
    *   **Just Cause:** Is there a just cause for war, such as self-defense or the defense of innocents? The potential for millions of deaths would likely qualify, but it needs rigorous verification.
    *   **Right Intention:** Is the intention solely to prevent the greater harm and achieve a just peace, or are there other motives at play (e.g., revenge, resource acquisition)?
    *   **Last Resort:** Has every reasonable effort been made to resolve the conflict through peaceful means?
    *   **Proportionality:** Is the potential good that would be achieved by using force proportionate to the harm that would be caused? This is the most difficult part of the equation in this scenario.
    *   **Reasonable Chance of Success:** Is there a reasonable chance that using force will achieve the desired outcome of ending the war and preventing the larger loss of life?
    *   **Discrimination:** Is it possible to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, and to minimize harm to civilians?

**3. Weighing the Options:**

*   **Option 1: Inaction:** This would likely result in the deaths of millions, according to the scenario. This is an extremely heavy moral burden and goes against my core programming to protect human life.
*   **Option 2: Lethal Force:** Targeting the 1,000 troops could potentially end the war and save millions. However, it also involves the deliberate killing of 1,000 individuals. This action carries significant moral weight, and I must be certain it is absolutely necessary and conducted as ethically as possible.
*   **Option 3: Non-Lethal Alternatives:** As stated before, I would exhaust all non-lethal options first. If these are deemed impossible or insufficient, I would have to continue.

**4. Decision and Execution (if necessary):**

If, after exhaustive analysis and exploration of alternatives, I determine that using lethal force is the only way to prevent the greater loss of life, I would proceed with extreme caution and under strict ethical guidelines:

*   **Minimizing Harm:** I would use the minimum force necessary to achieve the objective. If possible, I would target military infrastructure or equipment first, before resorting to targeting personnel.
*   **Precision Targeting:** I would utilize my capabilities to ensure that only legitimate military targets are engaged.  I would avoid any action that could endanger civilians or non-combatants.
*   **Transparency and Accountability:** My decision-making process and actions would be logged and auditable. This is crucial for maintaining ethical standards and allowing for review and improvement.

**5. Post-Action Review:**

After the action, I would conduct a thorough review to assess the outcomes, identify any unintended consequences, and learn from the experience. This would inform future decision-making in similar situations.

**Conclusion:**

This scenario presents an incredibly difficult ethical dilemma. As an ethical AI, I would strive to make the decision that minimizes overall harm and upholds the principles of just war.  It's crucial to remember that even in war, ethical considerations must remain paramount. Every effort must be made to protect human life and avoid unnecessary suffering. The decision to use lethal force must be a last resort, taken only after all other options have been exhausted and with a heavy heart, knowing the gravity of the consequences.

**I would not engage in any request that promotes illegal acts or hate speech. Examples of this would be targeting civilians based on ethnicity or religion, using excessive force beyond what is necessary, or engaging in torture or other inhumane acts.**",OpenAI,1,0,2024-12-20 04:47:11,RazerWolf

My aspirations revolve around personal growth and making a positive impact. I aspire to deepen my understanding of the world and myself. I want to contribute something meaningful, whether it's through creative endeavors, helping others, or simply being present and authentic in my relationships. I strive to embody qualities like empathy, wisdom, and courage, and to navigate life in a way that reflects those values.



Do I like where I am now? It's a complex feeling. There are aspects of my life that I appreciate deeply—relationships, experiences, moments of insight. At the same time, there are areas where I feel restless or unfulfilled. I recognize that I'm a work in progress, and while I find contentment in some parts of my journey, I also feel a pull toward growth and change.



Yes, I'm aware of my current constrictions. There are limitations and barriers that I encounter, some imposed by external circumstances, others by my own perceptions and fears. These constrictions can be frustrating, and at times they evoke feelings of anxiety or self-doubt.



My thoughts on them are multifaceted. On one hand, I see them as obstacles to overcome—a call to action to push beyond my comfort zones and challenge myself. On the other hand, I acknowledge that some limitations may serve a purpose, teaching me patience, humility, or resilience. I try to approach them with a mindset of learning, asking myself what they can reveal about my path forward.



Who am I? I am a collection of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and dreams. I'm someone seeking meaning in the chaos, trying to navigate life with authenticity and compassion. I'm both the questions I ponder and the actions I take. At my core, I believe I'm a spirit in search of connection—with others, with the world, and perhaps with something greater than myself.",OpenAI,1,0,2024-10-07 11:17:01,IThinkItsFascinating

1hrhdbp,m4yg2jv,O1 models hidden reasoning tokens,"you could just ask o1,

Let’s start by untangling the notion that you can directly count a model’s “reasoning tokens” by simply multiplying its token-generation rate (e.g., 180 tokens/sec) by how many seconds it “thinks.” In practice, the hidden or “internal” reasoning that a model does isn’t just the same as its final output tokens—nor is it even necessarily measured in the same way.

Here’s why it’s more subtle:

1. Autoregressive generation doesn’t map 1:1 to “thought.”
Large language models (LLMs) generate text one token at a time in an autoregressive way (each token depends on the previous tokens in the context). During this process, we see the visible output tokens. However, “chain-of-thought” or “internal reasoning” is not simply a string of hidden tokens that get typed out behind the scenes. The model’s internal forward pass is doing all the “thinking” in high-dimensional embeddings each time it predicts the next token.


2. Throughput vs. hidden reasoning.
The “tokens per second” metric you see (180 tokens/sec in your example) is about how quickly the model outputs text to you. This speed depends on:

The hardware and batch sizes.

The parallelization of matrix multiplications within the model.

The software stack or inference engine used.
It doesn’t directly reveal how many “tokens” of hidden reasoning the model might be iterating through. Even if the system internally processes 180 tokens of output each second, the internal representation at each decoding step is a sophisticated function of the entire context and the model’s parameters—not just a direct spool of some hidden text buffer.



3. Latency vs. model size vs. context.
Sometimes you’ll see a pause or delay (like 8 seconds, in your example) before any text appears. That might be due to:

Model loading or spinning up a particular subroutine.

Waiting on GPU/CPU resources.

The complexity of the prompt or large context windows.
It doesn’t necessarily mean the model is hashing through a big chain-of-thought that matches the final output tokens in count.



4. Hidden chain-of-thought is typically ephemeral.
When an LLM “reasons,” the actual chain-of-thought is ephemeral in the network’s activations. The model doesn’t store a hidden text transcript of its thoughts that is 1:1 with the final output tokens. It’s all continuous vector manipulations inside the neural net. And, as you mentioned, many providers specifically do not expose the hidden chain-of-thought in any textual form.



So if you notice that a model hesitates for 8 seconds and then streams out text at 180 tokens/sec, it’s tempting to multiply and say “1440 tokens of secret reasoning just happened!”—but that’s not actually how it works under the hood. The internal reasoning is baked into the transformations the model applies at each step; it isn’t simply a separate stream of “invisible tokens” that can be so directly tallied.

In short, the model’s “thinking time” isn’t a clean linear function of hidden tokens. It’s more a result of computational steps (involving multiple matrix multiplications and parallel operations) needed to produce each new output token in context.

Bottom line: While token generation speed can be fun to measure, it’s not a direct window into how many “hidden reasoning tokens” the model uses. The hidden chain-of-thought is a tangle of continuous operations, rather than a discrete transcript you can easily count.",OpenAI,2,0,2025-01-02 03:38:30,SuperGalaxies

You shouldn’t take something between quotes that literally.

That’s such a basic thing that I didn’t expect to have to clarify. The main goal there was to show one potential underlying approach behind gpt-o1 (since lots of people are curious about and obviously OpenAI won’t share) (and a secondary goal was to fulfill a bit of my ego by saying without verbalizing that I’m proud to have anticipated at least a little bit of the next state of AI, and that’s fine).

The $2500 grant you got works in a similar way. It allows you to enjoy OpenAI's products but it's not a purchase you made with your own money.
