My 1080ti was one of the biggest you could get next to the kingpin and I still have just over an inch left of room before it hits the HDD cage.

Can't wait to see the thermal tests of these new designs. It's basically one giant heat sink and with two fans it has to be decent for cooling.

g4hutcq,"I have to say... I f'in love those coolers. This is what happens when Nvidia's engineers have to find a solution to more power hungry silicon while given more design freedom. AMD really needs to do the same... this generation should be the end of reference cooler memes. Don't expect them to outperform all the massive AIB cards but still...

However, I'm not stoked about the 12 pin location. That seems like an awkward place for cable management and the width could become a concern. Low profile, angled adapters may become really popular.

Also what's the deal with the covers on the 3090?
