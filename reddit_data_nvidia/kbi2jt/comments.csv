These companies are not your friends. I don't know why YouTubers and Fanboys have a bias about anything. Ray Tracing is the future even if YouTubers, Fanboys, Nvidia or AMD would agree to disagree it is literally there to replace traditional rasterization in the future  even if we have to take small steps to get there.

gfj1xf4,"Of course Nvidia are scummy! Why else would they market and release a GPU without having enough stock built up to satisfy demand?

They don't give a shit about the ""gamers"", why else would they allow their cards to be scalped for thousands of dollars!

Just like every other capitalist organization, like AMD or Intel, or really any other megacorp, they exist to make money for their shareholders. Not for the ""gamers.""

Personally? This isn't going to stop me from buying their products. I have no interest in bogus brand loyalty wars. I'll buy the product which suits my needs and wants, not the product which has the ""nicest"" company.

gfihamb,"I don't really see the problem with the initial email. Why would you give product away for free to reviewers who don't care about the main feature of your products? 

The whole point of giving away product for free is advertising. If you don't think a certain reviewer is having a positive effect then you are quite literally paying for bad publicity. Why would anyone in their right mind do that?

Yes, of course I understand why these guys who make their living reviewing products are shaken by it, I mean it's directly affecting their livelihoods. But I don't give a fuck about that, and I don't understand why you guys do either. You can't expect to give bad reviews and continue receiving product for free. It's a voluntary symbiotic relationship. If you stop being a benefit to your partner, why should they keep you as a partner? The answer is simple, they shouldn't. And that's why they don't.",9,2020-12-12 11:45:13

gfhxus7,"It's a shitty move from Nvidia. I disagree with HUB in RT being a gimmick as it will not only make shadows and lighting much better for us, the consumers, but it is also much easier for devs to work with. Also: DLSS 2.0 is a fantastic feature. Hands down. 

As a consumer always buying the high end when I buy, I am actually interested in how they perform with all the bells and whistles turned on. Rasterization performance alone is more relevant in mid tier GPUs for me, like in the 3060Ti vs whatever AMD counterpart that will come.

I think HUB should focus much more on bells and whistles at the high end but their reviews are none the less very good and without a doubt one of my first 3 reviews when I am looking for an upgrade, so I think this is a bad move from Nvidia no matter what.

Being so small minded is something that has rubbed me the wrong way and it will play a part when I am looking for a new GPU the next time.

Here is hoping AMD fixes their GPU drivers.",13,2020-12-12 06:55:43

You only saw only one side of this, I'd like to see their emails because I doubt HUB is completely innocent here. Besides that nvidia as any other company are in no obligation to send free samples to reviewers, and there are plenty of critical reviewers out there and they are not blacklisted, take a moment to think about that.

gfib6yx,"I am a small influencer that happen to do editorial work for photography. I was blacklisted by sony because I offered some constructive criticism (despite winning a sony world photo award and being an early adopter)

That email doesn't surprised me. What I learnt: Some Companies view online reviewers & infkuencer as advertisers. They send them schwags (e.g graphics cards and stuff) to expect positive reviews. That's why we see overly positive review of graphics card (where a graphics card is said to crush the competition when it's only 2-3√∑ higher)

There is unfortunately not code of conduct in that wild wide west influencer industry.. By leading Nvidia's train of criticism here, I think Jay2cents, hardware unboxed and co have a huge opportunity here to create industry standard for this industry.

NVIDIA are the behemoths of GPUs. They consistently set the bar and people in here then get into a circle jerk of comparisons because they got an extra .004fps once when there was a full moon. 

The market wants their cards. If they perceive a bias against one of their products (I have yet to see anyone admit that HWU was particularly and obviously bigging up AMD downplaying DLSS in the latest reviews?) they have every right so say ‚ÄúNope, no more preferential treatment for you.‚Äù

The email is scummy in the ""did someone really think it was ok to write this?"" sense, but the point of the message isn't really shocking or indicative of systemic corruption at NVIDIA.

They're talking about giving free GPUs to a reviewer *to do a review*. They're not making any rules about what the reviewer's opinion can or can't be (at least, not in the one email I saw). They're saying ""hey, we gave you this product to review, and you routinely didn't review the whole product.

Plus, it's not like it's a ban for life. Nvidia basically said if they include RTX in the reviews they're allowed again. Idk, maybe I missed something big but it just seems like the internet is over-reacting to rich people being sad again.",4,2020-12-12 10:04:02
gfimmeu,"When are people going to stop believing these altruistic fantasies that these companies give a shit about anything other than money?  They don't care about you or the gaming community.  At all.  They care about you buying their products.  That's it.  They want to make the best product so you buy it and make their investors a solid return so they keep getting funding to make more shit for you to buy.  If their product isn't the best, they will do everything they can to make you think it is so you buy it, including suppressing critical reviews.  Does it suck?  Sure, but it's corporate reality.",4,2020-12-12 12:34:16

gfjdslf,"Well, it seems the YTers got the message from NVIDIA (maybe other companies like Apple is next, all the Apple bashing, etc.). ""We made you overnight, and we can break you in seconds.""

Think about, how many reviewers gets a ""free sample unit"" to review? 15 - 20 out of a 100+ just waiting to take their place?

I do agree with the YTers on one side of the fence but I also agree with NVIDIA.

I'm not reading that NVIDIA is saying to lie about their product or give it a outstanding review or else but be fair about the NVIDIA's features. I'm reading, talk about the benefits of our DLSS like you are talking about the benefits for AMD's SAM (that really don't do much at all for performance other than an extra 1-4 fps). If you look at some reviews, many reviewers mention the benefits for AMDs SAM but barely mention any NVIDIA features. That is true.

LTT, Jay, GN and others don't get it. If they don't receive a free sample, FIRST, and if it goes to new reviewers instead, how many potential views would they lose and AD / SPONSERS for not bringing in the same large number of viewers?

No, they don't work for NVIDIA but they do HOPE ad companies / SPONSERS and reviewers support their channel.

If I'm a ad company, I would support a channel that gets the hottest products FIRST to review (because they will get the quickest impulse views) before others.",3,2020-12-12 15:28:17

gfkeamg,"I have had shares of stock since the 3Dfx days. I have sold those shares. 

The cancer has infested that company throughout. They are horrible to their employees as well as their manufacturers and distributors. They patent troll, and are being more blatant in destabilizing legitimate reviews. 

I will not be a part of that any more. 

P.S. Inside information, I don't care about NDA: Real scrutiny needs to be made on their Ray Tracing marketing and capabilities claims. It isn't actually ray tracing at all, and they are lying about the whole thing to try to beat AMD. This is also why there were so few release titles on next gen consoles. ALL developers are having trouble with the false marketing claims that made it into design papers. They claim covid is delaying games, only because they are being required to by license, rather than be able to admit something wrong with the whole thing..

This is why scalpers were allowed. Many are shady employees in Nvidias marketing team to keep eyes away from what isn't there.


Source: Invested heavily in 3dfx, it got bought out, multiple stock splits later, hoped to have a retirement, but having been very knowledgeable about the inner working of Nvidia, their ethical problems getting worse and worse, I believe they are now committing fraud fully. I will not have a part in that.

I will continue buying the products that I like based on their performance and ease of use and think of all big corps. as shady. 

The bottom line is all corps. exist to make money. They don't have feelings and don't care about us as people and only think of us as a potential customer.",2,2020-12-12 21:56:22
