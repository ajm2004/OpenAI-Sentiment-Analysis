Not for the \"gamers.\"\n\nPersonally? This isn't going to stop me from buying their products. I have no interest in bogus brand loyalty wars. I'll buy the product which suits my needs and wants, not the product which has the \"nicest\" company. \n\nHowever, Nvidia are going down the EA path with this bullshit, and they may never recover from this sort of brand dissent. They deserve to get knocked down a few pegs anyway, to keep them as honest possible (we know there's no honesty in capitalism)",

If you don't think a certain reviewer is having a positive effect then you are quite literally paying for bad publicity. Why would anyone in their right mind do that?\n\nYes, of course I understand why these guys who make their living reviewing products are shaken by it, I mean it's directly affecting their livelihoods. But I don't give a fuck about that, and I don't understand why you guys do either. You can't expect to give bad reviews and continue receiving product for free.

I disagree with HUB in RT being a gimmick as it will not only make shadows and lighting much better for us, the consumers, but it is also much easier for devs to work with. Also: DLSS 2.0 is a fantastic feature. Hands down. \n\nAs a consumer always buying the high end when I buy, I am actually interested in how they perform with all the bells and whistles turned on. Rasterization performance alone is more relevant in mid tier GPUs for me, like in the 3060Ti vs whatever AMD counterpart that will come.\n\nI think HUB should focus much more on bells and whistles at the high end but their reviews are none the less very good and without a doubt one of my first 3 reviews when I am looking for an upgrade, so I think this is a bad move from Nvidia no matter what.\n\nBeing so small minded is something that has rubbed me the wrong way and it will play a part when I am looking for a new GPU the next time.\n\nHere is hoping AMD fixes their GPU drivers.",

You only saw only one side of this, I'd like to see their emails because I doubt HUB is completely innocent here. Besides that nvidia as any other company are in no obligation to send free samples to reviewers, and there are plenty of critical reviewers out there and they are not blacklisted, take a moment to think about that. Not defending nvidia here, just saying it's stupid how this blew out of proportion, youtubers defend their gang, redditors join in, but in the end it's all a load of crap.

What I learnt: Some Companies view online reviewers & infkuencer as advertisers. They send them schwags (e.g graphics cards and stuff) to expect positive reviews. That's why we see overly positive review of graphics card (where a graphics card is said to crush the competition when it's only 2-3\u00f7 higher)\n\nThere is unfortunately not code of conduct in that wild wide west influencer industry.. By leading Nvidia's train of criticism here, I think Jay2cents, hardware unboxed and co have a huge opportunity here to create industry standard for this industry.\n\nThanks to them for leading the charge!",

They're not making any rules about what the reviewer's opinion can or can't be (at least, not in the one email I saw). They're saying \"hey, we gave you this product to review, and you routinely didn't review the whole product. We think that's not worth our investment, and GPU stock is low these days, so unfortunately we've decided not to supply you with review units at this time.\"\n\n...

From my understanding Nvidia stopped \\[essentially\\] sponsoring the channel for reviews as they don't focus on RTX enough; seeing as RTX is now a core, and really good, feature of these GPUs that sets them league above the rest why wouldn't Nvidia be pissed off?  \n\n\nPlus, it's not like it's a ban for life. Nvidia basically said if they include RTX in the reviews they're allowed again. Idk, maybe I missed something big but it just seems like the internet is over-reacting to rich people being sad again.",

They don't care about you or the gaming community.  At all.  They care about you buying their products.  That's it.  They want to make the best product so you buy it and make their investors a solid return so they keep getting funding to make more shit for you to buy.  If their product isn't the best, they will do everything they can to make you think it is so you buy it, including suppressing critical reviews.  Does it suck?  Sure, but it's corporate reality.",

I'm reading, talk about the benefits of our DLSS like you are talking about the benefits for AMD's SAM (that really don't do much at all for performance other than an extra 1-4 fps). If you look at some reviews, many reviewers mention the benefits for AMDs SAM but barely mention any NVIDIA features. That is true.\n\nLTT, Jay, GN and others don't get it. If they don't receive a free sample, FIRST, and if it goes to new reviewers instead, how many potential views would they lose and AD / SPONSERS for not bringing in the same large number of viewers?\n\nNo, they don't work for NVIDIA but they do HOPE ad companies / SPONSERS and reviewers support their channel.\n\nIf I'm a ad company, I would support a channel that gets the hottest products FIRST to review (because they will get the quickest impulse views) before others.",

They are horrible to their employees as well as their manufacturers and distributors. They patent troll, and are being more blatant in destabilizing legitimate reviews. \n\nI will not be a part of that any more. \n\nP.S. Inside information, I don't care about NDA: Real scrutiny needs to be made on their Ray Tracing marketing and capabilities claims. It isn't actually ray tracing at all, and they are lying about the whole thing to try to beat AMD. This is also why there were so few release titles on next gen consoles. ALL developers are having trouble with the false marketing claims that made it into design papers. They claim covid is delaying games, only because they are being required to by license, rather than be able to admit something wrong with the whole thing..\n\nThis is why scalpers were allowed. Many are shady employees in Nvidias marketing team to keep eyes away from what isn't there.\n\n\nSource: Invested heavily in 3dfx, it got bought out, multiple stock splits later, hoped to have a retirement, but having been very knowledgeable about the inner working of Nvidia, their ethical problems getting worse and worse, I believe they are now committing fraud fully. I will not have a part in that. \n\nThose at Nvidia who know me, come at me.",
