            "Body": "I really wish everyone could experience RTX ultra (I assume the next-gen console update next year will have mild ray tracing, which will be much better than nothing). The rasterized graphics for this game are greatttt in 4K for me, but RTX adds so many changes (most are subtle you'd have to look at side by side comparison screenshots) and other times the changes smack you right in the face. The thing about good RTX implementation is that walking around things just look \"right\". Your brain knows a red neon sign should turn the storefront across the street a red hue and with RTX you get that, with rasterization you don't (I dunno how to post screenshots on here to show an example). You walk by a blue building then see its reflection in another building up ahead as opposed to some generic blob that definitely isn't the building you just walked by. Just far less things for your brain to go \"hey wait a sec that doesn't seem right.\"\n\nThe reflection resolution on medium/far objects isn't necessarily the greatest though but I obviously understand the need for that to salvage performance.",

Honestly wasn\u2019t that bad at first but some times it\u2019d chug down to 20\u2019s and then it really felt bad!\n\nDidn\u2019t want to turn of RT, tried many settings, but it was the biggest hit I could see (I didn\u2019t test them all).  Now with RT off and DLSS on performance I can play with almost all Ultra settings at 1440p UW on my 2080 and I get about 80fps!  Game still looks beautiful AF too!  I\u2019ll have to save RT for if I can ever get a 3080 I guess.

Yes, Control is corridor TPS and this is open world game, but FPS indoors also tanks a lot with RT. Game basically don't like any alt-tab or setting switch because if you do that you get like 5-20 fps lower than after exiting and starting again.  \nRTX 3080 3800x 32gb 3600 RAM",
