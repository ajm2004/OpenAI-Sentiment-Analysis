gf9ytjj,Performance? Settings? Running same resolution so I was curious.,722,2020-12-10 13:47:10
gfa7hmb,"I really wish everyone could experience RTX ultra (I assume the next-gen console update next year will have mild ray tracing, which will be much better than nothing). The rasterized graphics for this game are greatttt in 4K for me, but RTX adds so many changes (most are subtle you'd have to look at side by side comparison screenshots) and other times the changes smack you right in the face. The thing about good RTX implementation is that walking around things just look ""right"". Your brain knows a red neon sign should turn the storefront across the street a red hue and with RTX you get that, with rasterization you don't (I dunno how to post screenshots on here to show an example). You walk by a blue building then see its reflection in another building up ahead as opposed to some generic blob that definitely isn't the building you just walked by. Just far less things for your brain to go ""hey wait a sec that doesn't seem right.""

The reflection resolution on medium/far objects isn't necessarily the greatest though but I obviously understand the need for that to salvage performance.",172,2020-12-10 14:50:17
gf9yn3v,"Heeey! If you're concerned about high fps, but don't want to compromise on graphical fidelity, here are some settings to consider (compiled from popular posts on /r/cyberpunkgame):  
  
Chromatic Aberration: **OFF**  
Film Grain (helps with blurriness): **OFF**  
Cascaded Shadow Resolution (a must): **~~OFF~~** **Medium**   
Nvidia Control Panel > Image Sharpening: **ON**  
  
Have fun choombas!  
  
#EDIT:  
Raytracing Settings:  
**MEDIUM**: Lighting ONLY  
**ULTRA**: Lighting + Shadows + Reflection  
**PSYCHO**: Ultra + Global Illumination

I was getting 40-ish FPS with mostly high settings, some medium with RT on and DLSS on performance on 1440p UW.  Honestly wasn’t that bad at first but some times it’d chug down to 20’s and then it really felt bad!

Didn’t want to turn of RT, tried many settings, but it was the biggest hit I could see (I didn’t test them all).  Now with RT off and DLSS on performance I can play with almost all Ultra settings at 1440p UW on my 2080 and I get about 80fps!  Game still looks beautiful AF too!  I’ll have to save RT for if I can ever get a 3080 I guess.  Oh tried DLSS on balanced and get 65fps, didn’t notice a visual difference though.

Yes, Control is corridor TPS and this is open world game, but FPS indoors also tanks a lot with RT.

gfeqqh7,"Awesome setup! The RTX 3080 is literally a beast at 1440p.

With everything at max (runs at 62-68fps)
Turn off - Film grain, Chromatic aberration and motion blur, makes the game look more sharp imo.
DLSS set to ''Quality'' does wonder for me.
Ray-Traced Lighting set to ''Psycho'' instead of ''Ultra'' has no impact on performance in my experience.
There's also the ''Screen Space Reflections Quality'' which can be set to ''Psycho'' with no visible hit in performance. All in all the game runs perfectly fine with the RTX 3080.
