The people running bots won't care, but someone is going to be delayed because of the CAPTCHA and blame that for them missing out.\n\nIt reminds me of when people were freaking out at Blizzard for not having case sensitive passwords, when all the security experts were saying it really didn't make a difference because cases really only mitigate brute force attempts, for which they already have protection + they make up only a tiny minority of stolen passwords. But god forbid anyone listens to experts.\n\nSecurity theater wins the day.",
