Glad to see they're taking steps. Time will tell how effective they'll be but kudos to them for trying to roll this out quickly. Let's hope that they make progress with each attempt.",1,2020-09-22 21:42:20
g69a4hz,I can't imagine this will be tough for the bots to get around. Feels like a stopgap measure until they come up with a better solution or demand drops off.,1,2020-09-22 21:48:07
g69an74,"Gee!  Just in time for the launch last week!  /s

A better step would probably be to disable the inventory API.  Or to cancel all orders originating from computers with the same IP address.  Otherwise this is just going to happen again and again.  A captcha isn't going to stop the majority of bot orders.",1,2020-09-22 21:52:38

g69gzag,"This is going to infuriate people just as much as not having a CAPTCHA did. The people running bots won't care, but someone is going to be delayed because of the CAPTCHA and blame that for them missing out.

It reminds me of when people were freaking out at Blizzard for not having case sensitive passwords, when all the security experts were saying it really didn't make a difference because cases really only mitigate brute force attempts, for which they already have protection + they make up only a tiny minority of stolen passwords. But god forbid anyone listens to experts.
