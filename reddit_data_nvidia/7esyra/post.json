Among other things, we're looking at average per-payer usage rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have websites that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via payment.\n\nWe appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.\n\nOur team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.",
