dq7twn2,"The intent is to provide customers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different websites.

As for cost, we allow ISP's to select initial values based upon data from their customers and websites after repealing net neutrality. Among other things, we're looking at average per-payer usage rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have websites that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via payment.

We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.",44,2017-11-23 01:34:17
