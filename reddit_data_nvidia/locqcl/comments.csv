im sure people waiting for months feel the love right now!  Also, as Linus points out, the silicon used on the mining cards is entirely worthless after the mining boom ends.  they won't be usable as discount GPUs for gaming, it's just scrap.  And it's still chips wasted on mining cards rather than a new 3060 or what have you.",113,2021-02-20 22:15:19

go68uvf,I got my 1080Ti for cheap cuz of the last crypto crash and skipped the 2000 series. Now probably someone like me who was thinking that there is gonna be an opportunity down the line to get a RTX 3000 gpu for cheap may not have that anymore.,31,2021-02-21 00:06:55
go54ukz,"I still can't comprehend of how many people are happy that NVIDIA is removing capabilities of the GPUs just to cater to them, lol. 

NVIDIA or any company is not your friend, and it will try to get the most of your money, you being a gamer, a miner, etc.

This can be a precedent of NVIDIA to remove even more features (which some of them existed already, like the Quadros) of the cards in the future, but people happy coz ""yeh fuck miners"", and they forgot that scalpers still exist, they increased the prices before the mining boom.

go5a8us,"I mean, Nvidia does care about gamers (and CUDA users, Pro users, and HPC) just not in the way that gamers would like to believe; They don't ""care about gamers"" in the sense that they are passionate about gaming and the people who are part of the hobby.

What do they care about then? They care about consistent, cyclical repeat customers in markets that they dominate: PC Gaming, Compute, AI, etc and, unlike tractors in farming or mechanical tools that can be repaired and reused for a good 50 years, these things have a finite life expectancy due to the ever growing needs for more performance and cryptomining booms are directly disrupting their core revenue streams for short term gain, which is what they are trying to avoid.

To linus's second point: I don't believe that nvidia (or AMD, or Intel, or any publicly traded company for that matter) should shoulder responsibility for the second-hand market or even enable it. To be clear, they shouldn't actively discourage it either, but if you know that these cryptominers will disrupt your core revenue streams not once, but twice (first with the shortage and then with the pump-and-dump scenario on the second hand market after they are done), it makes sense for any company not to find this scenario desirable.

Nvidia is protecting themselves and their core revenue streams, which we happen to be part as long as we buy their products, but they are most definitely not your ""gamer buds"", it just so happens that this time around corporate interests more or less aligned with the average consumer.",399,2021-02-20 19:06:09

go556vq,"Totally understand the point re: used GPU and e-waste but Linus is missing the point here when he said ""no miners are buying 3060"".

The 3060 thing is just a start. There's already rumor out there that Nvidia is going to release a hardware revision to all their chip which contains this hashrate limiter ([which by the way seems to be a hardware+firmware+driver thing](https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590) so going to be difficult to bypass) so eventually all NEW GeForce cards will be gimped for mining and miners will have to buy used ones that's currently on the market or the CMP cards.",103,2021-02-20 18:24:08

go7pbcs,"For those lazy here is the sum of the video plus my additional take at the end:

Although they put a driver block which will be bipassed easily by miners and will lead to it being useless.

Second  even if now they are using scrap rtx cards (if we believe them) it is sure that at some point if demand for the new hx cards is high they will start using also perfectly capable rtx cards to make hx --> less rtx cards.

Third point is that the ""new"" hx cards once the hash requirement increases will be perfect scrap because if before miners flooded the used miners with used cards at good prices now those hx cards will simply be thrown in the bin not only increasing e-waste but meaning that more people will have to buy new geforce cards from nvidia instead buying them used-->more money for nvidia

Linus position plus my take: nvidia at the moment like everyone has a very  low production so doing this will not boost production from nothing but  production will (if they use really scrapped rtx cards) will be the same.

The  result is that Nvidia is doing basically nothing to make supply better with this move but is from one side trying to cover their ass by  saying the shortage is due to mining (not true at all) but we will fix it and second it is creating  another market segment, like it likes to do for everything they sell, to make even more money and all of this with gaming has nothing to do  with.",6,2021-02-21 09:55:09
go7w7s8,"My biggest concern about this is the recycling and what it does to the planet.

First of all, I'm not a person that think we should live in trees, go hunting with a wooden spear and all that jazz.   
I do however think we should do whatever we can to have a healthy planet.   
To my point:  
As Linus said: There's a reason Reduce and Reuse comes before Recycle.  
   
Ref other points he made about this in the video:  
As long as we have 1 planet to live on and no way of going somewhere else, we should handle the planet with the care it deserves. My opinion is that we as the only known intellectual species in the universe owe it to ourselves to find all the secrets of the universe we live in, or atleast don't be in the way of others doing so (if we don't find science interesting). We can't do that if we're dead. We also can't do that in 1 or 10 generations.   
For this reason, I think the capitalist society we live in, even though it has helped on many scientific fronts as well, has a lot of big bad wolves in the form of huge company leaders that mostly care about their own pockets, which this move from Nvidia is a great example of.   


It's also quite apparent that 95% of people that dabbles in crypto currency are also only in it for the money. I won't make any statements about the blockchain technology, since I know nothing about it, but I will say that as a man that has worked with setting up multiple mining parks with 10s of thousands of hardware rigs and also worked with troubleshooting, fixing and general service of these rigs, it's not good. It's capitalism and money hunger with capital letters and no regards for anything else. Not even the neighbours of the facilities. 

If we're to keep our planet for generations to come we need to stop thinking about getting rich and start thinking about the environment. In this specific case, this means to keep the GPUs as they've been, making it possible for people to buy second hand electronics easier instead of throwing it all in the garbage.",6,2021-02-21 11:51:07

1. They Give Cryptominers non reuseable cards forcing gamers to buy new
2. capitalize on Crytomining
3. Limit the amount of GPUs available for gamers forcing gamers to use Remote access gaming like Gforce NOW ( which further benefits Nvidia)
4. Make use of low end silicon stock they just have sitting around.
5. Piss linus off.",3,2021-02-20 19:57:01

He first mentioned that the CMP lineup might be taking chips from gaming cards. In reality, manufacturers can draw different lines differentiating what's consider good or bad chips. That's why Intel has i9-10850K to solve the chips shortage last year. 10850K is taken from the same wafers as 10900K but they are less capable of boosting to higher clocks (worse silicon quality). 

For miners, they under clock their GPUs to save electricity cost. I don't see why can't nvidia use worse chips for the mining cards.

Then he said that the cards used for mining can be resold to gamers. Being a shareholder of Nvidia, this is BS to me. Nvidia shouldn't be competing against their own products in this way.",6,2021-02-20 22:05:44
go5bdsc,"Everyone complains about miners. Nvidia finds a solution to the problem. Everyone gets mad. What is the thought processes here?

If you say that it sets a precedent, it doesn't. They've been doing it for a long time with Quadro and more recently Titan cards. You know what came of it? Nothing, the Titan doesn't even exist this generation.

You know why nothing will come of it? Quadro and Titan are ""professional"" cards, and professional don't care about the price / performance ratio. The second they start breaking features and defy the base line expected performance of a normal user and sell them as a different products, is the second that everyone jumps ship to AMD.

People are willing to go with this, because miners are the single reason why the price is so high and availability low (miners buy everything, creating scarcity, which creates scalpers). No one would support them if they went after anyone else in any meaningful way.

Regarding e-waste. If miners don't buy 3060, then most of them will end up in the hands of normal users, same for when they implement it in future cards. Thus there is no need to wait for a ""deal"" on cards that were thermally abused for months. Miners won't just throw out CMPs once the bubble pops, they'll either panic sell them or just keep them around for when the bubble reappears. People have their cards, miners have their CMPs, nothing gets thrown out.",6,2021-02-20 19:15:22
go5q2jq,"while i will never respect miners, the precedent of making one group (miners) seem like the bad guys to appeal to another group (gamers) is unnerving because its clear they are willing to play sides.

id rather the company just offer the product to both me and the group I don't like and who ever gets it, gets it. trying to play sides means that while they might side with me today they could be against me tomorrow.",3,2021-02-20 21:20:09
go5nux7,"Mining workloads don't hit like gaming workloads do. There are cards you can mine very effectively on that you wouldn't want to game on. That silicon already exists, and either gets product segmented, or trashed.

I'm of the opinion that cryptocurrency is a really bad idea and can die in a fire, but from a waste perspective simply having a mining line that has a lower binning tolerance for parts quality isn't the worst thing in the world. Nvidia has to provide at least a certain amount of GPUs to their AIBs, so going ""oops no GPUs!"" to EVGA while direct selling a bunch of mining cards direct to farms is an easy way to get EVGA to launch a Radeon line or whatever.",3,2021-02-20 21:01:00

go9q0zy,This video was fine but the bbc article on bitcoin electricity consumption was a cheap shot. How much electricity does the video games industry use? Or any other industry?

I hate to be so mean but it's time to stick your head out into the real world. I think a lot of the people did take the wrong colored pill. Because they don't see how business is done. It's all about profits but that turns into R+D for newer better products. And yes sadly you are the ""wallet"", somewhat by choice. And yes they pay the shareholders. That's also how public companies work.

NVDA is just making as much as possible while bitcoin is still hot. The gamers will always be there waiting for new graphics cards and VR tech. ""Go to where the money is and get it while you can. The gamer wallet will always be there"". I'm sure this is the talk in the big wigs meetings.
