Also, as Linus points out, the silicon used on the mining cards is entirely worthless after the mining boom ends.  they won't be usable as discount GPUs for gaming, it's just scrap.  And it's still chips wasted on mining cards rather than a new 3060 or what have you.",

They care about consistent, cyclical repeat customers in markets that they dominate: PC Gaming, Compute, AI, etc and, unlike tractors in farming or mechanical tools that can be repaired and reused for a good 50 years, these things have a finite life expectancy due to the ever growing needs for more performance and cryptomining booms are directly disrupting their core revenue streams for short term gain, which is what they are trying to avoid.\n\nTo linus's second point: I don't believe that nvidia (or AMD, or Intel, or any publicly traded company for that matter) should shoulder responsibility for the second-hand market or even enable it. To be clear, they shouldn't actively discourage it either, but if you know that these cryptominers will disrupt your core revenue streams not once, but twice (first with the shortage and then with the pump-and-dump scenario on the second hand market after they are done), it makes sense for any company not to find this scenario desirable.\n\nNvidia is protecting themselves and their core revenue streams, which we happen to be part as long as we buy their products, but they are most definitely not your \"gamer buds\", it just so happens that this time around corporate interests more or less aligned with the average consumer.",

There's already rumor out there that Nvidia is going to release a hardware revision to all their chip which contains this hashrate limiter ([which by the way seems to be a hardware+firmware+driver thing](https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590) so going to be difficult to bypass) so eventually all NEW GeForce cards will be gimped for mining and miners will have to buy used ones that's currently on the market or the CMP cards.",

            "Body": "My biggest concern about this is the recycling and what it does to the planet.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a person that think we should live in trees, go hunting with a wooden spear and all that jazz.   \nI do however think we should do whatever we can to have a healthy planet.   \nTo my point:  \nAs Linus said: There's a reason Reduce and Reuse comes before Recycle.  \n   \nRef other points he made about this in the video:  \nAs long as we have 1 planet to live on and no way of going somewhere else, we should handle the planet with the care it deserves. My opinion is that we as the only known intellectual species in the universe owe it to ourselves to find all the secrets of the universe we live in, or atleast don't be in the way of others doing so (if we don't find science interesting). We can't do that if we're dead. We also can't do that in 1 or 10 generations.   \nFor this reason, I think the capitalist society we live in, even though it has helped on many scientific fronts as well, has a lot of big bad wolves in the form of huge company leaders that mostly care about their own pockets, which this move from Nvidia is a great example of.   \n\n\nIt's also quite apparent that 95% of people that dabbles in crypto currency are also only in it for the money. I won't make any statements about the blockchain technology, since I know nothing about it, but I will say that as a man that has worked with setting up multiple mining parks with 10s of thousands of hardware rigs and also worked with troubleshooting, fixing and general service of these rigs, it's not good. It's capitalism and money hunger with capital letters and no regards for anything else. Not even the neighbours of the facilities. \n\nIf we're to keep our planet for generations to come we need to stop thinking about getting rich and start thinking about the environment. In this specific case, this means to keep the GPUs as they've been, making it possible for people to buy second hand electronics easier instead of throwing it all in the garbage.",

How?  Eliminate all AIB brands, not use retail stores, only sell through nvidia's homepage and verify each seller? Doesn't seem particularly reasonable suggestion.  \n\n\nFor the other part on CMP initially using poorly binned chips but in the future when chip production becomes better they might start using otherwise usable geforce chips... I'm fine with that.  This is an issue right now because production yields are lower, when production becomes better I don't really care what they put in the CMP. \n\n This doesn't have to be a solution for all time, just relieve some short term symptoms til production improves (or mining dies)",

(nVidia is the devil. miners are the devil. nVidia sells a tangible product society can use. miners reap an intangible currency the bourgeoisie will use. =/=.)\n\nIt's funny that miners say they aren't 'hurting anyone' when I never see mining disclosed on pre-owned GPUs, I never see 'miner' profiles participate in giveaways, I never see 'miners' cut deals in threads. I never see miners jump in convos about getting GPUs to gamers. The only time I see miners is when their shit gets messed with, and they come out in droves and cry anti-consumer. LOL.\n\nWell listen, you pompous turds. Nobody feels sorry for you, if you haven't noticed. And nobody ever will. nVidia won't reverse course on this. Deal with it the way we've dealt with your asses eating enthusiast hardware market just to make fat boy money on energy inefficient fad currency. You're niche, the only person that feels sorry for a miner is a miner. Best of luck, you reap what you sow, and 'words' ain't fixing it.\n\nThe very fact you took a dump on the market and then come around when you're dealt with asking for sympathy after you've usurped GPUs, energy, and talking points for a calendar year. Digital narcissism if I ever saw it, and at this point, a little 'crying wolf' complex, too.

            "Body": "This is the worst video I have ever seen from LTT.\n\nHe first mentioned that the CMP lineup might be taking chips from gaming cards. In reality, manufacturers can draw different lines differentiating what's consider good or bad chips. That's why Intel has i9-10850K to solve the chips shortage last year. 10850K is taken from the same wafers as 10900K but they are less capable of boosting to higher clocks (worse silicon quality). \n\nFor miners, they under clock their GPUs to save electricity cost. I don't see why can't nvidia use worse chips for the mining cards.\n\nThen he said that the cards used for mining can be resold to gamers. Being a shareholder of Nvidia, this is BS to me. Nvidia shouldn't be competing against their own products in this way.",

            "Body": "Everyone complains about miners. Nvidia finds a solution to the problem. Everyone gets mad. What is the thought processes here?\n\nIf you say that it sets a precedent, it doesn't. They've been doing it for a long time with Quadro and more recently Titan cards. You know what came of it? Nothing, the Titan doesn't even exist this generation.\n\nYou know why nothing will come of it? Quadro and Titan are \"professional\" cards, and professional don't care about the price / performance ratio. The second they start breaking features and defy the base line expected performance of a normal user and sell them as a different products, is the second that everyone jumps ship to AMD.\n\nPeople are willing to go with this, because miners are the single reason why the price is so high and availability low (miners buy everything, creating scarcity, which creates scalpers). No one would support them if they went after anyone else in any meaningful way.\n\nRegarding e-waste. If miners don't buy 3060, then most of them will end up in the hands of normal users, same for when they implement it in future cards. Thus there is no need to wait for a \"deal\" on cards that were thermally abused for months. Miners won't just throw out CMPs once the bubble pops, they'll either panic sell them or just keep them around for when the bubble reappears. People have their cards, miners have their CMPs, nothing gets thrown out.",

            "Body": "Mining workloads don't hit like gaming workloads do. There are cards you can mine very effectively on that you wouldn't want to game on. That silicon already exists, and either gets product segmented, or trashed.\n\nI'm of the opinion that cryptocurrency is a really bad idea and can die in a fire, but from a waste perspective simply having a mining line that has a lower binning tolerance for parts quality isn't the worst thing in the world. Nvidia has to provide at least a certain amount of GPUs to their AIBs, so going \"oops no GPUs!\" to EVGA while direct selling a bunch of mining cards direct to farms is an easy way to get EVGA to launch a Radeon line or whatever.",

Because they don't see how business is done. It's all about profits but that turns into R+D for newer better products. And yes sadly you are the \"wallet\", somewhat by choice. And yes they pay the shareholders. That's also how public companies work.\n\nNVDA is just making as much as possible while bitcoin is still hot. The gamers will always be there waiting for new graphics cards and VR tech. \"Go to where the money is and get it while you can. The gamer wallet will always be there\". I'm sure this is the talk in the big wigs meetings.\n\nDon't give me a thumbs down. That's how I see it and sometimes the truth hurts.",
