RT is important and core to the future of gaming, but it's also one part of our focused R&D efforts on revolutionizing video games and creating a better experience for gamers.  \n>  \n>This philosophy is also reflected in developing technologies such as DLSS, reflex and broadcast that offer immense value to customers who are purchasing a GPU. They don't get free GPUs, they work hard for their money, and they keep their GPUs from multiple years.  \n>  \n>Despite all this progress, your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers.  \n>  \n>It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do. Our founder's editions boards and other Nvidia products are being allocated to media outlets that recognize the changing landscape of gaming and the features that are important to gamers and anyone buying a GPU today. Be it for gaming, content creation, or studio and streaming.  \n>  \n>Hardware Unboxed should continue to work with our add-in card partners to secure GPUs to review. Of course you will still have access to obtain pre-release drivers and press materials, that won't change. We are open to revisiting this in the future should your editorial direction change.  \n>  \n>Bryan Del Rizzo  \n>  \n>Director of Global PR, GeForce",

BOTH OPINIONS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.\n\nEdit edit: thanks for the awards, and i was specifically referencing the 6800xt review ONLY. (I do watch HWUB alot. Every single video) I do know that the other reviews after werent.. in the same light as that one. Again i disagree with what nvidia did. The intention behind this post was just saying how someone from corporate or upstairs, completely disconnected from the world can see that one video and go aite pull the plug. Still scummy. My own personal opinion is, IF nvidia wanted to pull the plug, go for it. Its their prerogative. But they didnt need to try and twist HWUBs arm by saying \"should your editorial change etc etc\" and this is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES RT/DLSSfeatures (control, cold war, death stranding, now cyberpunk) to the extent I bought a 3090 just to ensure i get the best performance considering the hit.",

There's nothing in this that points to them cutting HUB off because of showing AMD being competitive in rasterization. If that were the case, they'd be cutting off most other reviewers, too, since most came to similar conclusions about performance.\n\nThis is clearly Nvidia not being happy about HUB's comments towards RT. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. The great thing about reviewers is that they all have different perspectives and help us see the whole picture. We shouldn't silence a voice just because it doesn't conform to what we want. \n\nSteve just thinks pretty poorly of real-time RT in its current state and likes to hammer that point in numerous times. So I can see why Nvidia would do this as they are doubling down on RTX. He's just one opinion, though, and his GPU benchmarks are excellent, even though his rhetoric and tone are slightly AMD-leaning.\n\nBut to be even more fair to HUB, they've actually been very positive about DLSS 2.0 in their recent videos and reviews.",

The performance fall-off on AMD cards in RT (which is definitely seeing a lot more implementation now) is so poor, that the marginal benefit in some rasterisation benchmarks drops the value of AMD cards considerably for me (as a better all-rounder value proposition). RT performance and proven scaling technology are huge features in my eyes when it comes to performance, especially for the games that I intend to play in the near future. I certainly couldn't accept arguments for AMD's cards being better value. I personally have zero allegiance to either brand, as I haven't had a gaming PC for about 10 years, so this is just my personal unbiased view of the current offerings. I can see Nvidia's side here, I just wonder if there was more communication between them before Nvidia pulled the plug, or if it was just a  ban out of nowhere.",

Regardless of how much you like/dislike HUB's content, this is a direct blow to independent reviewer integrity. It means that Nvidia and other companies (as we've seen with the shared emails by GN) are no longer interested in not controlling the narrative in the slightest. You reap what you sow - if you want advertisements to confirm your brand bias instead of independent reviews, that's what you'll get.",

They gave AMD a free pass on having worse RT by not benchmarking 6000 series in RT, and they rush to put SAM in reviews, but they won't bench with dlss.  They introduced Godfall and Dirt 5 into reviews to make sure AMD cards appear competitive, but they won't bench Control.\n\nIm going to go out on a limb and say nvidia has made up their mind that HUB is purely there to serve the AMD fanbase. If that's coincidence, it's just bad luck.  But lots of people call this channel out for such things.",

Yes, Rasterization matters but if a card has more features, why not cover it? Is it so hard to believe that we're moving towards a RT/DLSS era but you have to call it a gimmick? lol.\n\nIt's like doing a review on a brand new Nissan GTR, HP, speed but you know, let's not review the transmission or suspension at all.\n\n^ see how stupid that is? That's HUB.

If you've been watching their content over the last few years you would see a pattern of Nvidia BAD, AMD good.\n\nWhile I agree with them that DLSS 1.0 sucked, the way HWU Tim goes about bashing Nvidia and being condescending is not a good look for a review company.

Throwing your ban hammer out when a reviewer is critical of your product is a tad infantile.  Consumers want uncoloured reviews, not ones tinted green, red or blue. Criticism ( polite ones, mind you) should be a constructive tool used to better your product!  Marketing isn't there to cover up sins!",

Ray tracing doesn't matter. Look at their cyberpunk review if you aren't convinced. Hardware unboxed is literally the only tech site / group I have given up on.

Nvidia was up charging on that gen to fund further progression on their RT technology. So unless you had a 2080ti I don't think many people cared about RT since it trashed frame rates. This time around though HB has actually included a handful of titles featuring RT in their reviews. Yeah RT still trashes frames, but DLSS is certainly helping alleviate the hit. Also no one is going to benchmark cards strictly on RT titles since there are only 3-4 good ones that people would actually care about and most gamers are still playing older titles. Hell half the reviews I've watched didn't even fully cover RT performance. So what about them?",

Reality is I can barely tell the difference in normal gameplay, unless I stop and really focus in on a particular surface (e.g. really shiny ones). RT on full with 'Ultra' settings more than halves my framerate and I'm forced to use DLSS in attempt to bring back some of that loss.\n\nOffline path traced rendering engines (e.g. Blender Cycles) prove that ray tracing techniques have an ability to deliver absolutely true-to-life visuals, but it seems to me, the effects layer that current gen real-time gaming engines bring is really not the visual upgrade that nVidia would have you believe it is and the performance hit is massive.\n\nAll of this is to say, I agree with Hardware Unboxed as much as I wish I didn't.",
