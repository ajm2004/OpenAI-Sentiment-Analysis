>Hi Steve,  
>  
>We've reached a critical juncture in the adoption of ray tracing and it has gained industry-wide support from top titles, developers, game engines, APIs, consoles and GPUs.  
>  
>As you know Nvidia is all in for ray tracing. RT is important and core to the future of gaming, but it's also one part of our focused R&D efforts on revolutionizing video games and creating a better experience for gamers.  
>  
>This philosophy is also reflected in developing technologies such as DLSS, reflex and broadcast that offer immense value to customers who are purchasing a GPU. They don't get free GPUs, they work hard for their money, and they keep their GPUs from multiple years.  
>  
>Despite all this progress, your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers.  
>  
>It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do. Our founder's editions boards and other Nvidia products are being allocated to media outlets that recognize the changing landscape of gaming and the features that are important to gamers and anyone buying a GPU today. Be it for gaming, content creation, or studio and streaming.  
>  
>Hardware Unboxed should continue to work with our add-in card partners to secure GPUs to review. Of course you will still have access to obtain pre-release drivers and press materials, that won't change. We are open to revisiting this in the future should your editorial direction change.

gfea7rf,"What’s fascinating to me is that “we won’t provide (presumably free) review samples” is equivalent to “we’re gonna bury you.”

The industry behind reviewing tech is so dependent on reviews going live the *moment* that embargo is lifted that it’s a huge revenue hit to be forced to acquire tech the same way everyone else does. 

If anything, this situation seems to be a reminder that consumer demands (immediate reviews) are actually in opposition to consumer desires (unbiased reviews), because as long as there is a huge demand for immediate reviews there is going to be a huge amount of leverage available to manufacturers that get to decide who is blessed with review samples.",28,2020-12-11 14:58:45

gfe0krn,They are pushing Rtx way to hard and I think even they know its far from the pinicle of graphics card capabilities (basically it's very cool but also maybe a bit of a gimic). Final point is I don't have a clue what I'm talking about I'm still running a 980ti,34,2020-12-11 13:22:35
gfcyocv,"To play devils advocate, i can see why nvidia were pissed off based on HWUBs 6800xt launch video.

HWUB called RT basically a gimmick along with DLSS in that video, and only glossed over two titles, shadow of the tomb raider as well as dirt 5. 

Fwiw even r/amd had quite a number of users questioning their methodology from the 6800xt video (6800xt 5% behind 3080, ""the radeon does well to get close. 3080 1% behind 6800xt, ""nvidia is in trouble.)

I dont necessarily agree with nvidia doing this but I can see why they are pissed off.

Edit: For fucks sake read the last fucking line I DONT AGREE WITH NVIDIAS ACTIONS, I CAN SEE WHY THEY ARE PISSED THO. BOTH OPINIONS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

Edit edit: thanks for the awards, and i was specifically referencing the 6800xt review ONLY. (I do watch HWUB alot. Every single video) I do know that the other reviews after werent.. in the same light as that one. Again i disagree with what nvidia did. The intention behind this post was just saying how someone from corporate or upstairs, completely disconnected from the world can see that one video and go aite pull the plug. Still scummy. My own personal opinion is, IF nvidia wanted to pull the plug, go for it. Its their prerogative. But they didnt need to try and twist HWUBs arm by saying ""should your editorial change etc etc"" and this is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES RT/DLSSfeatures (control, cold war, death stranding, now cyberpunk) to the extent I bought a 3090 just to ensure i get the best performance considering the hit.",1061,2020-12-11 04:23:38

gfe7de1,"that's just stupid from nvidia, but I'm also curious why they decided to not focus on ray tracing?",6,2020-12-11 14:32:12
gficnel,Why are people so shocked? Nvidia has had shitty marketing strategy for years. As long as their product is good people will buy it anyway.,5,2020-12-12 10:52:20
gfd8av3,"This reads more like Nvidia wants the raytracing angle pushed more heavily or placed in a better light. There's nothing in this that points to them cutting HUB off because of showing AMD being competitive in rasterization. If that were the case, they'd be cutting off most other reviewers, too, since most came to similar conclusions about performance.

This is clearly Nvidia not being happy about HUB's comments towards RT. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. The great thing about reviewers is that they all have different perspectives and help us see the whole picture. We shouldn't silence a voice just because it doesn't conform to what we want. 

Steve just thinks pretty poorly of real-time RT in its current state and likes to hammer that point in numerous times. So I can see why Nvidia would do this as they are doubling down on RTX. He's just one opinion, though, and his GPU benchmarks are excellent, even though his rhetoric and tone are slightly AMD-leaning.

But to be even more fair to HUB, they've actually been very positive about DLSS 2.0 in their recent videos and reviews.",23,2020-12-11 06:11:44
gfcylvw,Is this the same HWUB that has been basically shitting on anything ray tracing for over 2 years now?,194,2020-12-11 04:22:57
gfd8sa2,"I wouldn't have expected it, but what I do see is that a lot of reviews leave RT performance to the last 5% of a review, which does present some form of bias towards pure rasterisation. The performance fall-off on AMD cards in RT (which is definitely seeing a lot more implementation now) is so poor, that the marginal benefit in some rasterisation benchmarks drops the value of AMD cards considerably for me (as a better all-rounder value proposition). RT performance and proven scaling technology are huge features in my eyes when it comes to performance, especially for the games that I intend to play in the near future. I certainly couldn't accept arguments for AMD's cards being better value. I personally have zero allegiance to either brand, as I haven't had a gaming PC for about 10 years, so this is just my personal unbiased view of the current offerings. I can see Nvidia's side here, I just wonder if there was more communication between them before Nvidia pulled the plug, or if it was just a  ban out of nowhere.",36,2020-12-11 06:18:01
gfd32kv,I would personally blame the marketing department supervisor or head who oversees the distribution of cards to reviewers. This is such a political move.,14,2020-12-11 05:10:07

gfg7wva,"Why they've done this is beyond me, they gain nothing other than bad PR.",7,2020-12-11 22:15:54
gfgniow,I guess people don’t watch hardware unboxed to know in his videos he usually says stuff like “I wouldn’t use it” I don’t see the point in Ray tracing” etc etc. So I don’t know why anyone would be surprise by Nvidia decision to not send him free stuff.,7,2020-12-11 23:59:17
gfdldi5,"It's kind of depressing how many people in the comments side with Nvidia on this one. Regardless of how much you like/dislike HUB's content, this is a direct blow to independent reviewer integrity. It means that Nvidia and other companies (as we've seen with the shared emails by GN) are no longer interested in not controlling the narrative in the slightest. You reap what you sow - if you want advertisements to confirm your brand bias instead of independent reviews, that's what you'll get.",36,2020-12-11 09:27:39
gfd4wwi,"I kind of See where Nvidia are coming with them currently, Ive watched most of their recent coverage and they seem to like beliving in a world where DLSS/ Ray Tracing are not relevent or valid when it comes to comparing to AMD products,  What just isnt true. Digital Foundry and Linus both pointed this out. These are very valid reasons to pick up a Nvidia Card and shouldnt be just brushed under as gimicks.",43,2020-12-11 05:30:45
gfdevzn,"I am not a fan of hwu channel and I'm always on disagreement with their reviews, however, this move from nvidia is just moronic.",15,2020-12-11 07:43:20
gfddeun,"Playing Devils advocate here: they constantly shit on nvidia for having introduced RT and dlss, while refusing to benchmark either.  They gave AMD a free pass on having worse RT by not benchmarking 6000 series in RT, and they rush to put SAM in reviews, but they won't bench with dlss.  They introduced Godfall and Dirt 5 into reviews to make sure AMD cards appear competitive, but they won't bench Control.

Im going to go out on a limb and say nvidia has made up their mind that HUB is purely there to serve the AMD fanbase. If that's coincidence, it's just bad luck.  But lots of people call this channel out for such things.",40,2020-12-11 07:21:26
gfd9h0u,"While I heavily, heavily disagree with HWUB's viewpoint on Ray Tracing (it IS viable), perhaps Nvidia have gone too far.

But then again HWUB isnt entitled to review samples, and I also feel that it's very wrong of them to completely ignore a feature that is prominent in Nvidia's marketing, viable or not, and I certainly do not believe thet HWUB is unbiased either. They're clearly at times Biased towards AMD despite the 6000 series being somewhat lacklustre at their price points compared to ampere

Besides there are other *plenty* of other unbiased reviewers you could watch, like gamersnexus.",35,2020-12-11 06:27:02
gfd9fqz,"People who argue that RT and DLSS are a gimmick are the same people who defend the fact that 16GB VRAM is not lmao.

Anyway, I don't agree with what Nvidia is doing but I couldn't care less. The fact that they banned HUB but no one else pretty much tells it all, especially if you're not biased.

Everyone shits on AMD and Nvidia, the difference is that HUB consistently never showcases Nvidia's RT/DLSS. Yes, Rasterization matters but if a card has more features, why not cover it? Is it so hard to believe that we're moving towards a RT/DLSS era but you have to call it a gimmick? lol.

It's like doing a review on a brand new Nissan GTR, HP, speed but you know, let's not review the transmission or suspension at all.

^ see how stupid that is? That's HUB. (And before someone says it's a stupid comparison, just think of the first time paddle shifters became a thing.. and look at it now, automatics and paddle shifters, hardly any manual cars anymore)",55,2020-12-11 06:26:34
gfd244z,"Ray tracing isn't a gimmick and it is something I strongly disagree with HWUB on. Having ray tracing on for Metro Exodus was a complete game changer and I am still not sure why that game isn't used as an example for great implementation of RT. For some reason people use Control as an example and I thought it was no where near as effective as Metro. To each their own.   


Cutting a reviewer off from your FE cards is a bit silly but so is ignoring an entire segment of gaming because you don't think it is worth it. Play silly games win silly prizes.",89,2020-12-11 04:59:42

gfdbknv,"First off, they can still buy their own.  They surely aren't the poorest of the tech reviewers.  

And If they are reviewing an RTX 3080 and they decide not to cover one of the main features of the card, which is ray tracing, I can see what the issue is.  

From what I am reading from this, and totally assuming, is that they are just comparing the rasterization performance...and maybe not the RTX or maybe the DLSS features because ""other cards can't do it so it's not fair""?

gfe1b18,"To be fair HWU has been biased towards AMD and has been for years.

Reverse the situation for RT and DLSS and the review of their products would go very differently. Their coverage of DLSS and RT performance during the AMD 6000 series reviews was laughable and questionable.

If AMD had both the better RT performance and/or had DLSS, HWU would be pushing that content so hard, praising AMD and saying to avoid Nvidia products as they're just not competitive.

This isn't the ONLY reason Nvidia is banning them. If you've been watching their content over the last few years you would see a pattern of Nvidia BAD, AMD good.

While I agree with them that DLSS 1.0 sucked, the way HWU Tim goes about bashing Nvidia and being condescending is not a good look for a review company. Nvidia has the right to say go F yourself if they want.",14,2020-12-11 13:30:49

I regularly watch Hardware Unboxed content and I think they do a fine and thorough job which they put a lot of time and effort in to and never did I get the idea from their 3000 series coverage that the cards are rubbish and that no one should buy them, even though that would still be a fair opinion if it were true. But they are great cards and nowhere has Hardware Unboxed stated otherwise. They even praised DLSS 2.0 which has actually been quoted by Nvidia on their own damn website!
How crooked can can you be.

Based on current performance anyone buying 6000 series is miles behind, 6900 XT can’t even compete with 2080Ti/3070 in raw RT performance and that’s before considering DLSS.

I doubt AMD’s upscaling offering will be competitive either.

Steve on the other hand...pretty biased for AMD. Not just in the language he uses when talking about benchmarks, what he benchmarks, and how it's all presented, but the think that drives me the nuts most is how he'll try to off-handedly pass rumors off as something more than rumors.  


He seems quite enamored with the ""Intel bribing OEMs not to use AMD chips"". I remember in one of his videos where he stated that OEMs wouldn't use AMD chips even if AMD gave them to the OEMs for free...which isn't even legal for AMD to do, anyway.

To add: Steve doesn’t care about RT and DLSS because he’s admittedly not a gamer. When he does a rare gaming session he’s playing old shit like C&C. So he plainly doesn’t care about it personally or professionally. He likes PC HW but this is just a job for him.

So unless you had a 2080ti I don't think many people cared about RT since it trashed frame rates. This time around though HB has actually included a handful of titles featuring RT in their reviews. Yeah RT still trashes frames, but DLSS is certainly helping alleviate the hit.

I spent an unreasonable amount of money on this card in anticipation of this game and I really, really wanted ray tracing to make a big difference in visual quality. Reality is I can barely tell the difference in normal gameplay, unless I stop and really focus in on a particular surface (e.g. really shiny ones). RT on full with 'Ultra' settings more than halves my framerate and I'm forced to use DLSS in attempt to bring back some of that loss.

Offline path traced rendering engines (e.g. Blender Cycles) prove that ray tracing techniques have an ability to deliver absolutely true-to-life visuals, but it seems to me, the effects layer that current gen real-time gaming engines bring is really not the visual upgrade that nVidia would have you believe it is and the performance hit is massive.
