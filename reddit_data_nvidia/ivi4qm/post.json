Not about the humans anyway. \n\nSo yeah, I think the way this was done has been shameful. And to now appeal to the very people who have been frustrated by their tactics and make it our responsibility to now \u201cdo the right thing\u201d just makes the experience go from a bit frustrating to really quite insulting. \n\nThis is their mess. They have the tools, capacity, messaging and ability to make this problem disappear. Why are we being asked to fix it?\n\nI hope AMD are watching because if their price is ok and their stocks are ok, they\u2019re going to win a large chunk of a now cynical community.

And if said scalper found a way to beat that system, then eBay could flag/limit their account pending investigation.\n\nI mean PayPal hassled me last week for selling a used 5700xt (that actually sold for more than I paid new for it) and a pair of phones that the wife and I had upgraded when we switched carriers.. they wanted to know more about \"my business\" and my \"vendors\"\n\nI mean if PayPal used their powers for good, they could stop these scalpers in a heartbeat..\n\nNvidia knew this was gonna happen though, they had been hinting at limited stock for a couple months (they say due to \"Covid supply issues\" but it's a \"keep supply low so demand will be high\" scenario. They could released WAY more cards so everyone would have a fair shot at getting one. But that's not their style.

If you go on ebay, you know, just wondering what it would *cost* to buy from those scumbag scalpers.\n\nWell it seems that $300 over MSRP will get you a 3080...sometime.\n\nBut there's a *wall* of Zotac cards at around $1000.   Not only is that a terrible brand - no warranty probably and I think Zotac's warranty is bad, so you'd be paying $1000 just to 'have' a 3080 but not a good one.\n\nBut the real question is...how many damn Zotacs did the scalpers get their hands on?  Where were these even being sold?",

            "Body": "EDIT: This is my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone know what a **teaser rate** is? It's like when you see that car being advertised for an insanely great price only for you to go to the dealership and be told, \"It already sold. But we have something like it. Costs a little more, though\".\n\n$699 for a 3080 is the teaser rate. Nvidia hyped everyone up with insanely great performance hints on the 3080.\n\nYou all wanted one. Then, the insanely cheap price was announced. Every one wanted one.\n\nProblem?\n\nNvidia never had the stock of 3080's in the first place. The retailers never had the stock in the first place ... and they had to know they didn't. The run their own merchandise tracking systems. Why would retailers go along with all the Nvidia hype, knowing they would never have enough stock to even satisfy basic demand.\n\nRelease day comes.\n\nNvidia never counted on the bots & Ebay taking what few 3080's were actually available.\n\nNo one can blame the bots for Nvidia overselling the hype and under-delivering the cards. Bots are not responsible for retailers on the Nvidia hype-train who KNEW they never would have sufficient stock to satisfy basic demand.\n\n*So, what did the retailers get to go along with the scam?*\n\nDoes anyone seriously believe that retailers do not know their own stock? If you do, send me $14.99 and I will deliver you the Moon, someday. No guarantee in the next 1000 years. Offer not valid in the entire Universe. Send me your money, anyway.\n\nThe backlash was swift. I am betting Nvidia shat their pants reading the forums of pissed-off consumers.\n\nOh, look. A few can now pre-order SOMETHING for delivery in October, November, and soon to be December and even NEXT YEAR. Nvidia had to do something to placate the consumers. That is what they come up with.\n\nHey, could be worse. In The USSR, you ordered your car years in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVIDIA'S (NOW DESTROYED) MARKETING PLAN:**\n\nGenerate the **hype**. Oh, look. Mystery. NDA on performance. Nvidia releases videos showing massive improvements. Well, that is sort of falling down. The cards are not 2x the performance.\n\n**Limited release with teaser rates. A form of bait-and-switch.**\n\nCar dealers do it all the time, as noted above. And IT WORKS.\n\nThe lucky few who get some? They generate the hype.\n\nYou hear from 10 people about how great their \"friends\" card is. They never mention a name. It seems like 10 people got the card. When those 10 people know the same person.\n\n**Word of mouth advertising** about how great the card is by the lucky few who somehow managed to get the card.\n\nTeaser rates EXPIRE. The true price would have been a few hundred dollars higher, especially with the Nvidia tax on 3rd party manufacturers. Who Nvidia could blame for rising prices. As well as demand created initially with teaser rates, restricted supplies, and a lucky few spreading the word among the masses about how great the 3080's are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE GREAT NVIDIA F\\*CK-UP**\n\n**BOTS**. Go check Ebay for where most of the very, very few cards that were to be sold to the public; actually ended up.\n\nThe planned hype marketing machine, bolstered by a lucky few consumers spreading the gospel seemingly like an Army of Nvidia, with Nvidia bragging about how great demand is... as prices then rise to their more realistic level in the coming months.\n\n**BOTS DESTROYED THAT. And yes, the bots are evil.**\n\nNvidia is forced to take pre-orders that won't be delivered until Oct, Nov, and soon... December and probably some won't get their card until next year. Or maybe Nvidia will actually pay lots of money to jump to the head of the manufacturing line.\n\nBecause, they pissed off a lot of people. Nvidia knows it. They only have to placate enough consumers, for that is what you are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMARKETERS have been heavily in psychology since the 1920's. Far longer than you have been alive. They have honed their arts for almost 100 years and passed that knowledge down. Their methods work. What seems as new methods today, are merely time-tested & true methods rebranded to get you to buy things. They know most consumer's buttons and which ones to push. Sometimes Madison Avenue screws up. They didn't count on the bots.\n\nNvidia did not count on being exposed by bots and the bot owners and Ebay market. A massive miscalculation on Nvidia's part. They should have given the last few incidents. And with the economy like it is? More people are desperate to make money any way they can.\n\n3080 was a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for SCAMMERS to target with their BOTS. Nvidia and Retailers got caught with their pants down. They would have pulled it off if it were not for the bots & scammers.\n\nNvidia still got payed. You got played. Here's some crumbs. You just have to wait for awhile to get your crumbs. Now fork over your cash, pre-pay for the pre-order. October 31st is coming soon and sales numbers must be up. CEO's & Board Members & Upper Management need their bonuses. Rich investors want their dividends.\n\n**THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.**\n\nGOOD LUCK, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.\n\nTo those lucky few who managed to get their cards? Fantastic.",
