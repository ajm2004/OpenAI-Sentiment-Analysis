g5rpnnr,"What do we do in new zealand and australia when we're being scalped by the actual retailers?

The MSRP is 1139 AUD for the founders in Australia (which already easily covers GST and shipping) , but I didnt see a single card under 1300, and most were 1400.

New Zealand is no better. Converting the Australian MSRP to our currency we should be seeing cards start at 1250-1300 like 2080 supers cost over here, but the cheapest is 1475, and most are 1600 bucks.

g5sn5gc,"In concept of course this is true. 

Except NVIDIA chose to hype this card up, then price it substantially more aggressively than anything on the market for its performance. 

Then they launched during a global pandemic where people sadly are clinging on to small positives. It’s not normal times. 

To then (a tech company!?) be thoroughly lamped by bots and scalpers just suggests the company doesn’t really care. Not about the humans anyway. 

So yeah, I think the way this was done has been shameful. And to now appeal to the very people who have been frustrated by their tactics and make it our responsibility to now “do the right thing” just makes the experience go from a bit frustrating to really quite insulting. 

This is their mess. They have the tools, capacity, messaging and ability to make this problem disappear. Why are we being asked to fix it?

g5t67hv,"Ebay/PayPal should find a way to limit/stop these assholes. I mean eBay keeps a pretty good track of ""trending"" prices and MSRP. If a brand new item gets listed and goes over say 25% the auction would automatically end. And if said scalper found a way to beat that system, then eBay could flag/limit their account pending investigation.

I mean PayPal hassled me last week for selling a used 5700xt (that actually sold for more than I paid new for it) and a pair of phones that the wife and I had upgraded when we switched carriers.. they wanted to know more about ""my business"" and my ""vendors""

I mean if PayPal used their powers for good, they could stop these scalpers in a heartbeat..

Nvidia knew this was gonna happen though, they had been hinting at limited stock for a couple months (they say due to ""Covid supply issues"" but it's a ""keep supply low so demand will be high"" scenario. They could released WAY more cards so everyone would have a fair shot at getting one. But that's not their style. And now it's speculated there aren't going to be anymore till next year..

Well it seems that $300 over MSRP will get you a 3080...sometime.

But there's a *wall* of Zotac cards at around $1000.   Not only is that a terrible brand - no warranty probably and I think Zotac's warranty is bad, so you'd be paying $1000 just to 'have' a 3080 but not a good one.

Anyone know what a **teaser rate** is? It's like when you see that car being advertised for an insanely great price only for you to go to the dealership and be told, ""It already sold. But we have something like it. Costs a little more, though"".

$699 for a 3080 is the teaser rate. Nvidia hyped everyone up with insanely great performance hints on the 3080.

You all wanted one. Then, the insanely cheap price was announced. Every one wanted one.

Problem?

Nvidia never had the stock of 3080's in the first place. The retailers never had the stock in the first place ... and they had to know they didn't. The run their own merchandise tracking systems. Why would retailers go along with all the Nvidia hype, knowing they would never have enough stock to even satisfy basic demand.

Release day comes.

Nvidia never counted on the bots & Ebay taking what few 3080's were actually available.

No one can blame the bots for Nvidia overselling the hype and under-delivering the cards. Bots are not responsible for retailers on the Nvidia hype-train who KNEW they never would have sufficient stock to satisfy basic demand.

*So, what did the retailers get to go along with the scam?*

Does anyone seriously believe that retailers do not know their own stock? If you do, send me $14.99 and I will deliver you the Moon, someday. No guarantee in the next 1000 years. Offer not valid in the entire Universe. Send me your money, anyway.

The backlash was swift. I am betting Nvidia shat their pants reading the forums of pissed-off consumers.

Oh, look. A few can now pre-order SOMETHING for delivery in October, November, and soon to be December and even NEXT YEAR. Nvidia had to do something to placate the consumers. That is what they come up with.

Hey, could be worse. In The USSR, you ordered your car years in advance.

&#x200B;

**NVIDIA'S (NOW DESTROYED) MARKETING PLAN:**

Generate the **hype**. Oh, look. Mystery. NDA on performance. Nvidia releases videos showing massive improvements. Well, that is sort of falling down. The cards are not 2x the performance.

**Limited release with teaser rates. A form of bait-and-switch.**

Car dealers do it all the time, as noted above. And IT WORKS.

The lucky few who get some? They generate the hype.

You hear from 10 people about how great their ""friends"" card is. They never mention a name. It seems like 10 people got the card. When those 10 people know the same person.

**Word of mouth advertising** about how great the card is by the lucky few who somehow managed to get the card.

Teaser rates EXPIRE. The true price would have been a few hundred dollars higher, especially with the Nvidia tax on 3rd party manufacturers. Who Nvidia could blame for rising prices. As well as demand created initially with teaser rates, restricted supplies, and a lucky few spreading the word among the masses about how great the 3080's are.

&#x200B;

**THE GREAT NVIDIA F\*CK-UP**

**BOTS**. Go check Ebay for where most of the very, very few cards that were to be sold to the public; actually ended up.

The planned hype marketing machine, bolstered by a lucky few consumers spreading the gospel seemingly like an Army of Nvidia, with Nvidia bragging about how great demand is... as prices then rise to their more realistic level in the coming months.

**BOTS DESTROYED THAT. And yes, the bots are evil.**

Nvidia is forced to take pre-orders that won't be delivered until Oct, Nov, and soon... December and probably some won't get their card until next year. Or maybe Nvidia will actually pay lots of money to jump to the head of the manufacturing line.

Because, they pissed off a lot of people. Nvidia knows it. They only have to placate enough consumers, for that is what you are.

&#x200B;

MARKETERS have been heavily in psychology since the 1920's. Far longer than you have been alive. They have honed their arts for almost 100 years and passed that knowledge down. Their methods work. What seems as new methods today, are merely time-tested & true methods rebranded to get you to buy things. They know most consumer's buttons and which ones to push. Sometimes Madison Avenue screws up. They didn't count on the bots.

Nvidia did not count on being exposed by bots and the bot owners and Ebay market. A massive miscalculation on Nvidia's part. They should have given the last few incidents. And with the economy like it is? More people are desperate to make money any way they can.

3080 was a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for SCAMMERS to target with their BOTS. Nvidia and Retailers got caught with their pants down. They would have pulled it off if it were not for the bots & scammers.

Nvidia still got payed. You got played. Here's some crumbs. You just have to wait for awhile to get your crumbs. Now fork over your cash, pre-pay for the pre-order. October 31st is coming soon and sales numbers must be up. CEO's & Board Members & Upper Management need their bonuses. Rich investors want their dividends.

**THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.**

GOOD LUCK, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.

To those lucky few who managed to get their cards? Fantastic.",4,2020-09-19 05:22:05

Scalpers sell them for about 4000 RON ( 1 euro = ~4.9 RON ) whereas the distributors sell them for, average, 4400 RON ( so 80 more euros )

That's right, scalpers sell them for less than the distributors ( they bought from outside )",1,2020-09-19 14:54:24

g5tocu0,"As I see it, NVidia wants people to buy from greymarket scum.  The system was designed such that bots had the best chance to get product and there's no wait list, lottery system, or pre orders.

If you want customers to buy form you, you put them on a wait list and send them an offer as stock comes in.  The won't buy from the greymarket if they feel like they'll get theirs when it becomes available.  The wait list can have a refundable deposit as well as verify that the card and address are unique.

NVidia makes zero effort to put cards in the hands of real consumers.",1,2020-09-19 15:17:00

g5tu8ox,Totally agree. I waited to build my pc just because of the 3000 series cards and now everything is ready except for the 3080. And I’m not going to reward those devil scalpers,1,2020-09-19 16:02:18
g5tvp5s,Don't think for a second that Nvidia doesn't endorse or condone this behavior. There's a reason the order page didn't have a captcha and why they don't allow pre-orders. Exclusivity drives demand and people get desperate. They're just stealing moves from Nintendo's book now.,1,2020-09-19 16:14:24

g5u2wvg,I saw someone mention taking more advanced security like captcha or selling only by pickup with ID and card in hand. The amount of people I've seen on this and every other sub saying they had no chance to buy one is so sad and the ones bragging about getting one and already shipping is depressing. There are even ebay listing of people selling their confirmed purchases off other sites. It's pathetic.,1,2020-09-19 17:20:05
