What better way than to put the ugliest lip known to man on a gfx card? We want people to know our designers put in day and night to come up with the perfect ugly color and line combination to make sure people look twice. Between this and the rainbow \ud83c\udf08LEDS we really believe we nailed the ugly on the head. It is amazing that retards are buying these things right up. We can\u2019t keep up with demand. Ohhhh and we also send customers on Newegg bare ESD baggies GFX cards. Cherry bruh\u201d\n\n-EVGAjacob",
