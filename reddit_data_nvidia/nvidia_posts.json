RT is important and core to the future of gaming, but it's also one part of our focused R&D efforts on revolutionizing video games and creating a better experience for gamers.  \n>  \n>This philosophy is also reflected in developing technologies such as DLSS, reflex and broadcast that offer immense value to customers who are purchasing a GPU. They don't get free GPUs, they work hard for their money, and they keep their GPUs from multiple years.  \n>  \n>Despite all this progress, your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers.  \n>  \n>It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do. Our founder's editions boards and other Nvidia products are being allocated to media outlets that recognize the changing landscape of gaming and the features that are important to gamers and anyone buying a GPU today. Be it for gaming, content creation, or studio and streaming.  \n>  \n>Hardware Unboxed should continue to work with our add-in card partners to secure GPUs to review. Of course you will still have access to obtain pre-release drivers and press materials, that won't change. We are open to revisiting this in the future should your editorial direction change.  \n>  \n>Bryan Del Rizzo  \n>  \n>Director of Global PR, GeForce",

BOTH OPINIONS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.\n\nEdit edit: thanks for the awards, and i was specifically referencing the 6800xt review ONLY. (I do watch HWUB alot. Every single video) I do know that the other reviews after werent.. in the same light as that one. Again i disagree with what nvidia did. The intention behind this post was just saying how someone from corporate or upstairs, completely disconnected from the world can see that one video and go aite pull the plug. Still scummy. My own personal opinion is, IF nvidia wanted to pull the plug, go for it. Its their prerogative. But they didnt need to try and twist HWUBs arm by saying \"should your editorial change etc etc\" and this is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES RT/DLSSfeatures (control, cold war, death stranding, now cyberpunk) to the extent I bought a 3090 just to ensure i get the best performance considering the hit.",

There's nothing in this that points to them cutting HUB off because of showing AMD being competitive in rasterization. If that were the case, they'd be cutting off most other reviewers, too, since most came to similar conclusions about performance.\n\nThis is clearly Nvidia not being happy about HUB's comments towards RT. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. The great thing about reviewers is that they all have different perspectives and help us see the whole picture. We shouldn't silence a voice just because it doesn't conform to what we want. \n\nSteve just thinks pretty poorly of real-time RT in its current state and likes to hammer that point in numerous times. So I can see why Nvidia would do this as they are doubling down on RTX. He's just one opinion, though, and his GPU benchmarks are excellent, even though his rhetoric and tone are slightly AMD-leaning.\n\nBut to be even more fair to HUB, they've actually been very positive about DLSS 2.0 in their recent videos and reviews.",

The performance fall-off on AMD cards in RT (which is definitely seeing a lot more implementation now) is so poor, that the marginal benefit in some rasterisation benchmarks drops the value of AMD cards considerably for me (as a better all-rounder value proposition). RT performance and proven scaling technology are huge features in my eyes when it comes to performance, especially for the games that I intend to play in the near future. I certainly couldn't accept arguments for AMD's cards being better value. I personally have zero allegiance to either brand, as I haven't had a gaming PC for about 10 years, so this is just my personal unbiased view of the current offerings. I can see Nvidia's side here, I just wonder if there was more communication between them before Nvidia pulled the plug, or if it was just a  ban out of nowhere.",

They introduced Godfall and Dirt 5 into reviews to make sure AMD cards appear competitive, but they won't bench Control.\n\nIm going to go out on a limb and say nvidia has made up their mind that HUB is purely there to serve the AMD fanbase.

If you've been watching their content over the last few years you would see a pattern of Nvidia BAD, AMD good.\n\nWhile I agree with them that DLSS 1.0 sucked, the way HWU Tim goes about bashing Nvidia and being condescending is not a good look for a review company.

Not just in the language he uses when talking about benchmarks, what he benchmarks, and how it's all presented, but the think that drives me the nuts most is how he'll try to off-handedly pass rumors off as something more than rumors.  \n\n\nHe seems quite enamored with the \"Intel bribing OEMs not to use AMD chips\". I remember in one of his videos where he stated that OEMs wouldn't use AMD chips even if AMD gave them to the OEMs for free...which isn't even legal for AMD to do, anyway.  \n\n\nEveryone has their biases and preferences and I'm not going to shit on people just for having them, but if you're seen as a crucial reference for other people at least be more professional than that.",

Nvidia was up charging on that gen to fund further progression on their RT technology. So unless you had a 2080ti I don't think many people cared about RT since it trashed frame rates. This time around though HB has actually included a handful of titles featuring RT in their reviews. Yeah RT still trashes frames, but DLSS is certainly helping alleviate the hit. Also no one is going to benchmark cards strictly on RT titles since there are only 3-4 good ones that people would actually care about and most gamers are still playing older titles. Hell half the reviews I've watched didn't even fully cover RT performance. So what about them?",

But i personally would prefer if we can take it a step further?\n\nPlus, getting review samples isn't your god given right, these tech channels always kind of leave a bad taste in my mouth when they complain about not getting one (when there's no sponsorship/contract)",

Reality is I can barely tell the difference in normal gameplay, unless I stop and really focus in on a particular surface (e.g. really shiny ones). RT on full with 'Ultra' settings more than halves my framerate and I'm forced to use DLSS in attempt to bring back some of that loss.\n\nOffline path traced rendering engines (e.g. Blender Cycles) prove that ray tracing techniques have an ability to deliver absolutely true-to-life visuals, but it seems to me, the effects layer that current gen real-time gaming engines bring is really not the visual upgrade that nVidia would have you believe it is and the performance hit is massive.\n\nAll of this is to say, I agree with Hardware Unboxed as much as I wish I didn't.",

Not for the \"gamers.\"\n\nPersonally? This isn't going to stop me from buying their products. I have no interest in bogus brand loyalty wars. I'll buy the product which suits my needs and wants, not the product which has the \"nicest\" company. \n\nHowever, Nvidia are going down the EA path with this bullshit, and they may never recover from this sort of brand dissent. They deserve to get knocked down a few pegs anyway, to keep them as honest possible (we know there's no honesty in capitalism)",

If you don't think a certain reviewer is having a positive effect then you are quite literally paying for bad publicity. Why would anyone in their right mind do that?\n\nYes, of course I understand why these guys who make their living reviewing products are shaken by it, I mean it's directly affecting their livelihoods. But I don't give a fuck about that, and I don't understand why you guys do either. You can't expect to give bad reviews and continue receiving product for free. It's a voluntary symbiotic relationship. If you stop being a benefit to your partner, why should they keep you as a partner? The answer is simple, they shouldn't. And that's why they don't.",

Rasterization performance alone is more relevant in mid tier GPUs for me, like in the 3060Ti vs whatever AMD counterpart that will come.\n\nI think HUB should focus much more on bells and whistles at the high end but their reviews are none the less very good and without a doubt one of my first 3 reviews when I am looking for an upgrade, so I think this is a bad move from Nvidia no matter what.\n\nBeing so small minded is something that has rubbed me the wrong way and it will play a part when I am looking for a new GPU the next time.\n\nHere is hoping AMD fixes their GPU drivers.",

Besides that nvidia as any other company are in no obligation to send free samples to reviewers, and there are plenty of critical reviewers out there and they are not blacklisted, take a moment to think about that.

What I learnt: Some Companies view online reviewers & infkuencer as advertisers. They send them schwags (e.g graphics cards and stuff) to expect positive reviews. That's why we see overly positive review of graphics card (where a graphics card is said to crush the competition when it's only 2-3\u00f7 higher)\n\nThere is unfortunately not code of conduct in that wild wide west influencer industry.. By leading Nvidia's train of criticism here, I think Jay2cents, hardware unboxed and co have a huge opportunity here to create industry standard for this industry.\n\nThanks to them for leading the charge!",

I'm reading, talk about the benefits of our DLSS like you are talking about the benefits for AMD's SAM (that really don't do much at all for performance other than an extra 1-4 fps). If you look at some reviews, many reviewers mention the benefits for AMDs SAM but barely mention any NVIDIA features. That is true.\n\nLTT, Jay, GN and others don't get it. If they don't receive a free sample, FIRST, and if it goes to new reviewers instead, how many potential views would they lose and AD / SPONSERS for not bringing in the same large number of viewers?\n\nNo, they don't work for NVIDIA but they do HOPE ad companies / SPONSERS and reviewers support their channel.\n\nIf I'm a ad company, I would support a channel that gets the hottest products FIRST to review (because they will get the quickest impulse views) before others.",

                "Body": "I really wish everyone could experience RTX ultra (I assume the next-gen console update next year will have mild ray tracing, which will be much better than nothing). The rasterized graphics for this game are greatttt in 4K for me, but RTX adds so many changes (most are subtle you'd have to look at side by side comparison screenshots) and other times the changes smack you right in the face. The thing about good RTX implementation is that walking around things just look \"right\". Your brain knows a red neon sign should turn the storefront across the street a red hue and with RTX you get that, with rasterization you don't (I dunno how to post screenshots on here to show an example). You walk by a blue building then see its reflection in another building up ahead as opposed to some generic blob that definitely isn't the building you just walked by. Just far less things for your brain to go \"hey wait a sec that doesn't seem right.\"\n\nThe reflection resolution on medium/far objects isn't necessarily the greatest though but I obviously understand the need for that to salvage performance.",

Yes, Control is corridor TPS and this is open world game, but FPS indoors also tanks a lot with RT. Game basically don't like any alt-tab or setting switch because if you do that you get like 5-20 fps lower than after exiting and starting again.  \nRTX 3080 3800x 32gb 3600 RAM",

It\u2019s not normal times. \n\nTo then (a tech company!?) be thoroughly lamped by bots and scalpers just suggests the company doesn\u2019t really care. Not about the humans anyway. \n\nSo yeah, I think the way this was done has been shameful. And to now appeal to the very people who have been frustrated by their tactics and make it our responsibility to now \u201cdo the right thing\u201d just makes the experience go from a bit frustrating to really quite insulting. \n\nThis is their mess. They have the tools, capacity, messaging and ability to make this problem disappear. Why are we being asked to fix it?\n\nI hope AMD are watching because if their price is ok and their stocks are ok, they\u2019re going to win a large chunk of a now cynical community. And so they should.",

If a brand new item gets listed and goes over say 25% the auction would automatically end. And if said scalper found a way to beat that system, then eBay could flag/limit their account pending investigation.\n\nI mean PayPal hassled me last week for selling a used 5700xt (that actually sold for more than I paid new for it) and a pair of phones that the wife and I had upgraded when we switched carriers.. they wanted to know more about \"my business\" and my \"vendors\"\n\nI mean if PayPal used their powers for good, they could stop these scalpers in a heartbeat..\n\nNvidia knew this was gonna happen though, they had been hinting at limited stock for a couple months (they say due to \"Covid supply issues\" but it's a \"keep supply low so demand will be high\" scenario. They could released WAY more cards so everyone would have a fair shot at getting one. But that's not their style. And now it's speculated there aren't going to be anymore till next year..\n\nWay to drop the ball Nvidia. AMD will most likely take full advantage of this with big Navi.",

Not only is that a terrible brand - no warranty probably and I think Zotac's warranty is bad, so you'd be paying $1000 just to 'have' a 3080 but not a good one.\n\nBut the real question is...how many damn Zotacs did the scalpers get their hands on?  Where were these even being sold?",

                "Body": "EDIT: This is my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone know what a **teaser rate** is? It's like when you see that car being advertised for an insanely great price only for you to go to the dealership and be told, \"It already sold. But we have something like it. Costs a little more, though\".\n\n$699 for a 3080 is the teaser rate. Nvidia hyped everyone up with insanely great performance hints on the 3080.\n\nYou all wanted one. Then, the insanely cheap price was announced. Every one wanted one.\n\nProblem?\n\nNvidia never had the stock of 3080's in the first place. The retailers never had the stock in the first place ... and they had to know they didn't. The run their own merchandise tracking systems. Why would retailers go along with all the Nvidia hype, knowing they would never have enough stock to even satisfy basic demand.\n\nRelease day comes.\n\nNvidia never counted on the bots & Ebay taking what few 3080's were actually available.\n\nNo one can blame the bots for Nvidia overselling the hype and under-delivering the cards. Bots are not responsible for retailers on the Nvidia hype-train who KNEW they never would have sufficient stock to satisfy basic demand.\n\n*So, what did the retailers get to go along with the scam?*\n\nDoes anyone seriously believe that retailers do not know their own stock? If you do, send me $14.99 and I will deliver you the Moon, someday. No guarantee in the next 1000 years. Offer not valid in the entire Universe. Send me your money, anyway.\n\nThe backlash was swift. I am betting Nvidia shat their pants reading the forums of pissed-off consumers.\n\nOh, look. A few can now pre-order SOMETHING for delivery in October, November, and soon to be December and even NEXT YEAR. Nvidia had to do something to placate the consumers. That is what they come up with.\n\nHey, could be worse. In The USSR, you ordered your car years in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVIDIA'S (NOW DESTROYED) MARKETING PLAN:**\n\nGenerate the **hype**. Oh, look. Mystery. NDA on performance. Nvidia releases videos showing massive improvements. Well, that is sort of falling down. The cards are not 2x the performance.\n\n**Limited release with teaser rates. A form of bait-and-switch.**\n\nCar dealers do it all the time, as noted above. And IT WORKS.\n\nThe lucky few who get some? They generate the hype.\n\nYou hear from 10 people about how great their \"friends\" card is. They never mention a name. It seems like 10 people got the card. When those 10 people know the same person.\n\n**Word of mouth advertising** about how great the card is by the lucky few who somehow managed to get the card.\n\nTeaser rates EXPIRE. The true price would have been a few hundred dollars higher, especially with the Nvidia tax on 3rd party manufacturers. Who Nvidia could blame for rising prices. As well as demand created initially with teaser rates, restricted supplies, and a lucky few spreading the word among the masses about how great the 3080's are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE GREAT NVIDIA F\\*CK-UP**\n\n**BOTS**. Go check Ebay for where most of the very, very few cards that were to be sold to the public; actually ended up.\n\nThe planned hype marketing machine, bolstered by a lucky few consumers spreading the gospel seemingly like an Army of Nvidia, with Nvidia bragging about how great demand is... as prices then rise to their more realistic level in the coming months.\n\n**BOTS DESTROYED THAT. And yes, the bots are evil.**\n\nNvidia is forced to take pre-orders that won't be delivered until Oct, Nov, and soon... December and probably some won't get their card until next year. Or maybe Nvidia will actually pay lots of money to jump to the head of the manufacturing line.\n\nBecause, they pissed off a lot of people. Nvidia knows it. They only have to placate enough consumers, for that is what you are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMARKETERS have been heavily in psychology since the 1920's. Far longer than you have been alive. They have honed their arts for almost 100 years and passed that knowledge down. Their methods work. What seems as new methods today, are merely time-tested & true methods rebranded to get you to buy things. They know most consumer's buttons and which ones to push. Sometimes Madison Avenue screws up. They didn't count on the bots.\n\nNvidia did not count on being exposed by bots and the bot owners and Ebay market. A massive miscalculation on Nvidia's part. They should have given the last few incidents. And with the economy like it is? More people are desperate to make money any way they can.\n\n3080 was a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for SCAMMERS to target with their BOTS. Nvidia and Retailers got caught with their pants down. They would have pulled it off if it were not for the bots & scammers.\n\nNvidia still got payed. You got played. Here's some crumbs. You just have to wait for awhile to get your crumbs. Now fork over your cash, pre-pay for the pre-order. October 31st is coming soon and sales numbers must be up. CEO's & Board Members & Upper Management need their bonuses. Rich investors want their dividends.\n\n**THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.**\n\nGOOD LUCK, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.\n\nTo those lucky few who managed to get their cards? Fantastic.",

I looked him dead in the eyes, laughed and left the store. Tbh I left pissed.

Given that, the fact that cards are selling for higher prices is inevitable. It's incredibly convenient for Nvidia to be able to take advantage of our ignorance to pin the blame on \"scalpers\".\n\nIf we really want to prevent this situation from happening again, we need to blame Nvidia so they know they can't have their cake and eat it too, i.e. release a product before they can supply it, and not face backlash from doing so.",

The won't buy from the greymarket if they feel like they'll get theirs when it becomes available.  The wait list can have a refundable deposit as well as verify that the card and address are unique.\n\nNVidia makes zero effort to put cards in the hands of real consumers.",

Looking at this image, you'd think the PCB is an add-on to the big box on the table (in layman's terms). \n\nI can definitely foresee a future where GPU is mounted in the case and a riser cable is use to connect to the motherboard. Imagine if you could top-mount the GPU in your case and have an internal PCI-e riser cable or something hook into the motherboard.",

They care about consistent, cyclical repeat customers in markets that they dominate: PC Gaming, Compute, AI, etc and, unlike tractors in farming or mechanical tools that can be repaired and reused for a good 50 years, these things have a finite life expectancy due to the ever growing needs for more performance and cryptomining booms are directly disrupting their core revenue streams for short term gain, which is what they are trying to avoid.\n\nTo linus's second point: I don't believe that nvidia (or AMD, or Intel, or any publicly traded company for that matter) should shoulder responsibility for the second-hand market or even enable it. To be clear, they shouldn't actively discourage it either, but if you know that these cryptominers will disrupt your core revenue streams not once, but twice (first with the shortage and then with the pump-and-dump scenario on the second hand market after they are done), it makes sense for any company not to find this scenario desirable.\n\nNvidia is protecting themselves and their core revenue streams, which we happen to be part as long as we buy their products, but they are most definitely not your \"gamer buds\", it just so happens that this time around corporate interests more or less aligned with the average consumer.",

My opinion is that we as the only known intellectual species in the universe owe it to ourselves to find all the secrets of the universe we live in, or atleast don't be in the way of others doing so (if we don't find science interesting). We can't do that if we're dead. We also can't do that in 1 or 10 generations.   \nFor this reason, I think the capitalist society we live in, even though it has helped on many scientific fronts as well, has a lot of big bad wolves in the form of huge company leaders that mostly care about their own pockets, which this move from Nvidia is a great example of.   \n\n\nIt's also quite apparent that 95% of people that dabbles in crypto currency are also only in it for the money. I won't make any statements about the blockchain technology, since I know nothing about it, but I will say that as a man that has worked with setting up multiple mining parks with 10s of thousands of hardware rigs and also worked with troubleshooting, fixing and general service of these rigs, it's not good. It's capitalism and money hunger with capital letters and no regards for anything else. Not even the neighbours of the facilities. \n\nIf we're to keep our planet for generations to come we need to stop thinking about getting rich and start thinking about the environment. In this specific case, this means to keep the GPUs as they've been, making it possible for people to buy second hand electronics easier instead of throwing it all in the garbage.",

It's running everything I need at acceptable framerates today. The only reason I wanted to upgrade was to fully enjoy flight simulators in VR. The shortage on RTX 3080/3090's has me stuck in place. I am planning on holding out until next year due to this pickle we're in with scalpers, COVID and crypto miners. \n\nWhat possible solution can nVidia come up with to ensure gamers are able to purchase the graphics cards they want?

How?  Eliminate all AIB brands, not use retail stores, only sell through nvidia's homepage and verify each seller? Doesn't seem particularly reasonable suggestion.  \n\n\nFor the other part on CMP initially using poorly binned chips but in the future when chip production becomes better they might start using otherwise usable geforce chips... I'm fine with that.  This is an issue right now because production yields are lower, when production becomes better I don't really care what they put in the CMP. \n\n This doesn't have to be a solution for all time, just relieve some short term symptoms til production improves (or mining dies)",

I can hate TWO THINGS at the same time, yet decide one is the lesser evil, and even flip them at any point information comes out. Critical thinking is a bitch, ain't it? (nVidia is the devil. miners are the devil. nVidia sells a tangible product society can use. miners reap an intangible currency the bourgeoisie will use. =/=.)\n\nIt's funny that miners say they aren't 'hurting anyone' when I never see mining disclosed on pre-owned GPUs, I never see 'miner' profiles participate in giveaways, I never see 'miners' cut deals in threads. I never see miners jump in convos about getting GPUs to gamers. The only time I see miners is when their shit gets messed with, and they come out in droves and cry anti-consumer. LOL.\n\nWell listen, you pompous turds. Nobody feels sorry for you, if you haven't noticed. And nobody ever will. nVidia won't reverse course on this. Deal with it the way we've dealt with your asses eating enthusiast hardware market just to make fat boy money on energy inefficient fad currency. You're niche, the only person that feels sorry for a miner is a miner. Best of luck, you reap what you sow, and 'words' ain't fixing it.\n\nThe very fact you took a dump on the market and then come around when you're dealt with asking for sympathy after you've usurped GPUs, energy, and talking points for a calendar year. Digital narcissism if I ever saw it, and at this point, a little 'crying wolf' complex, too. If all you have is 'YOUR GONNA REGRET THOSE HASHING NERFS WHEN U HANDBRAKE A BLURAY' then you don't have shit for an argument. Even if you're right, lol, that ain't a 'problem', bud.\n\nedits, srry for wall, added TLDR\n\n***TL;DR Miners: words are not a sign of good faith, actions are a sign of good faith, we do not feel bad for you because you posted a complaint on Reddit, we are wary of you because- well just go to fucking eBay and take a look in the mirror, dawg***  \n\n\n*Edit 2: Linus has spent like 200 thousand dollars on crap in one month. I ask you not take my word but just look at the titles of his last two months of content and grab a calculator. One says 'this guy wasted X money', one says 'wife mad XXX.' Mid hardware shortage mid pandemic this guy comes out and acts like he can relate. I DO like Linus but he ain't the disenfranchised's People's Champ.*",

In reality, manufacturers can draw different lines differentiating what's consider good or bad chips. That's why Intel has i9-10850K to solve the chips shortage last year. 10850K is taken from the same wafers as 10900K but they are less capable of boosting to higher clocks (worse silicon quality). \n\nFor miners, they under clock their GPUs to save electricity cost. I don't see why can't nvidia use worse chips for the mining cards.\n\nThen he said that the cards used for mining can be resold to gamers. Being a shareholder of Nvidia, this is BS to me. Nvidia shouldn't be competing against their own products in this way.",

What is the thought processes here?\n\nIf you say that it sets a precedent, it doesn't. They've been doing it for a long time with Quadro and more recently Titan cards. You know what came of it? Nothing, the Titan doesn't even exist this generation.\n\nYou know why nothing will come of it? Quadro and Titan are \"professional\" cards, and professional don't care about the price / performance ratio. The second they start breaking features and defy the base line expected performance of a normal user and sell them as a different products, is the second that everyone jumps ship to AMD.\n\nPeople are willing to go with this, because miners are the single reason why the price is so high and availability low (miners buy everything, creating scarcity, which creates scalpers). No one would support them if they went after anyone else in any meaningful way.\n\nRegarding e-waste. If miners don't buy 3060, then most of them will end up in the hands of normal users, same for when they implement it in future cards. Thus there is no need to wait for a \"deal\" on cards that were thermally abused for months. Miners won't just throw out CMPs once the bubble pops, they'll either panic sell them or just keep them around for when the bubble reappears. People have their cards, miners have their CMPs, nothing gets thrown out.",

Nvidia has to provide at least a certain amount of GPUs to their AIBs, so going \"oops no GPUs!\" to EVGA while direct selling a bunch of mining cards direct to farms is an easy way to get EVGA to launch a Radeon line or whatever.",
