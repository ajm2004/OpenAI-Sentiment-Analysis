Therefore, we require a model for asymmetric semantic search (where the query is generally shorter in length than the passages to be retrieved). The [Sentence Transformer documentation](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search) recommends models trained on the MS-MARCO information retrieval dataset, for asymmetric semantic search. \n",
